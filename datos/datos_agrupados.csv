0,"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",Electronics,"I‚Äôll admit I was very skeptical from reviews but I decided to purchase anyways‚Ä¶. and so far so good! Battery life is about 7 hours of constant use (games, videos, etc). Sounds is good. I had no problems connecting to internet. The border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many. The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it‚Äôs obviously struggling to keep the cord in place. No working well can't download any apps horrible phone My old Android works better than this junk. Please refund money. Diana Manuele It‚Äôs for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it‚Äôs only take 2 hours Worked slow, barely charged. Battery life is not good at all. Only last an hour. The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star I‚Äôm very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that‚Äôs jut right. This phone case has everything I‚Äôm looking for. It‚Äôs not to bulky and has a slim fit. It‚Äôs enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn‚Äôt cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen ‚Äúappear‚Äù smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I‚Äôm wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don‚Äôt snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It‚Äôs very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it‚Äôs a defect. Phone broke a little after a month. Was only given a small % back on return and was never told why after multiple emails. Do not buy!!!! Phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived. It stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months. even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund. Too small in size The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed. Hey- it‚Äôs an iPhone. I did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it.The phone is OK, but the battery is horrible. GSM does not work. This version of IPhone cannot be repaired. I stop being able to update, because it does not connect to the local network. It is WITHOUT SERVICE ... that is, now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music ... Battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use  The battery is at 50%? I mean, impossible to use it. Lousy purchase They should withdraw it from circulation to these iPhone 7 Phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen doesn‚Äôt like to work, wouldn‚Äôt recommend this phone. phone works great, but battery needs replacement, per the iPhone settings screen, just over 3 months after purchase. Does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized, not using GPS in background etc. Otherwise price was reasonable. The phone battery was supposed to be at 80% or better but this battery only 77% and Apple saying need to replace battery now. It's too bad vendors don't install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires. Aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery. Good condition, but instantly overheats when charge. Not sure if that‚Äôs normal but the body of it great condition This IPhone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it . Also it charges slow , The phone is unlocked no scratches , no flaws . Came right on clear. Packaged for fragile item very well. My daughter loves her new phone. It is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating. My review is half bad and half good. It came in almost a week, which I was crazy waiting for it. I was so happy when it got here! I checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62, which was so disappointing. It charges really fast, but loses a lot of percent quick. Other than that everything was good. It came with a charger and charger block. I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas. It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund. Easy to use I got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner didnt factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screen.Works well i like it!! 8/10 üòÉ batter health was at 70 not the promised 80. Bad phones you are not honest I bought this for a July gift.  It stopped working 8 months later.  It would no longer receive a cellular signal.  It took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone.  I took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed. üò© So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration Died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on. I‚Äôm disappointed with this phone‚Äôs battery life. I have to make sure I keep a charger with me everywhere I go. This is my first experience with an iPhone so maybe that is how they are, I don‚Äôt know. This was in good condition and battery life good. Seller guarantees 80% battery. Received phone with battery capacity of only 75%. Seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a $20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested. Bought this refurbished iPhone for our daughter.  We like the parental controls that Apple offers.  We aren't going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from Amazon. Overall good product! The cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works. The battery dies very quickly, but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card. Very good product! I just got this  for my middle school son in time for school to start. It needed charging upon arrival, but the charging cord/plug that came with it did not work. Luckily this  is a replacement phone, and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it charged.It's working so far. I can't comment on battery life yet because it's too soon. The phone appeared to be in excellent condition. Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly. I like everything I don‚Äôt dislike nothing Fine I like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, ""battery health"" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice ""Youmaker"" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this. Runs slow , colabirtation is off and screen glitches Battery life is insufficient and less than expected. Phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it‚Äôs not charging pretty annoyed about this. Bad battery life junk charger, just buy new instead of having to do it anyways Home button non functional. Wasn't bad came in good condition. If I can fit everything I didn‚Äôt like about this phone into this box I would detail it.But whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobWon‚Äôt register any SIM cards to any carrierIt looks like I bought it from wish.com There‚Äôs a black line when trying to take pictures, takes horrible pictures The phone is used and it doesn‚Äôt earphones Everything was great. Like brand new! Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good. COMPANY I WENT WITH: TECH EXCHANGEE NY screen had a small crack and a chip  and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact. however the phone does work. Cord does not work! This device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying. I send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard. This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don‚Äôt even when we‚Äôre not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase Item came without a charger I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me! Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price Phone works great i have to say no problems so far 5/5 Have this phone just over six months it glitches, turns off all the time, battery drains fast, phone won't shut off even when the battery is at 98%.  The amount of money I spent on it I should have gotten more than 6 months use, wouldn't recommend. The phone  barley work can‚Äôt call nobody can‚Äôt text nobody Why it dies so fast ? It‚Äôs ok It‚Äôs a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own. Dies very fast! Annoying. The stop working in 2 weeks Extremely scratched and banged up. Shouldn't have passed quality control. Unless the standards are that low Perfect condition The battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am - 1 pm so I figured I would get a new phone - The new phone is lasting from 7 am - 11am and says the battery is 100% healthy.... Worst purchase ever don't waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on Phone has no signal Antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window.  Worked great until then. i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and u can‚Äôt turn it on silent mood Look good Speaker are not working Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that. The phone I received did not have a working microphone. Couldn‚Äôt record or make calls. The company issued me a full refund. They have great customer service but sold a faulty device so I gave a neutral rating. Honestly I was so nervous to buy a phone from Amazon for the 7 year old stepson ... but reviews can be very deceiving .. phone worked GREAT !! Now if I can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it ... The phone doesn‚Äôt work. I can hear a person I call, but they can‚Äôt hear me. I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn‚Äôt risk it. My battery dies way too soon. The package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance. The camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the ‚Äúnew‚Äù look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone. No work for Verizon Great phone thank you i was confused by the packet  i received with item, it said iphone 5s - i was ready to return(im a new iphone user) i was kinda disappointed with charger not working - had to buy additional one to use phone - overall its a great item - The phone was very nice looking phone, but I had to return the  phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service. The phone constantly restarts itself. The battery lasts all of 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying a phone from this company.. they‚Äôre junk. I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new. This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that‚Äôs kind of insane since they are in NY and i‚Äôm in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it‚Äôs pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven‚Äôt experienced any issues so far but it‚Äôs only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you‚Äôre having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don‚Äôt give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won‚Äôt work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don‚Äôt have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i‚Äôm extremely pleased, it was a risk but i‚Äôm happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller. The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button didn't work and you can't use Verizon it is not Amazon renewed its a scam Phone is ok, no marks or scratches, but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone.  Battery life isn't great. There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was. Every renewed phone I‚Äôve gotten before this one had a renewed battery. This one did not. Will have to get one soon, phone charge only last a few hours. Would not have bought it if I would have known the battery was not renewed. ok It was good phone till a month after purchase kinda salty about it still wish i didnt spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter. The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major. Gof a great product. Fast response Phone worked great for about 6 months. Then it stopped connecting to the cellular service. Trying to update it and the phone says that I can‚Äôt. Called Apple support and they can‚Äôt do anything since phone is no longer under warranty. Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to üíØ it‚Äôs never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can‚Äôt find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can‚Äôt get it turned on due to the fact that it won‚Äôt accept a SIM card. I found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers. Nice piece My son loves it. Arrived quick, looks new, & works great! He‚Äôs been smiling since Received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in, shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable.Phone came with one long deep scratch, a cracked home button, and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches, enough that it was off putting for me. Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away. Overall a decent phone but I will be returning it because of the the cracked Touch ID button and deep scratches The phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it . Gift good condtion A good way to get a new iPhone at a good price The battery is useless, it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge, needs to be replaced All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones. Didn‚Äôt come with any kind of paperwork and it‚Äôs working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times. Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I‚Äôm not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use Daughter loves it No fingerprints reader and the phone Glitches a lot I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it. I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I‚Äôm sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box). The phone is very small. BATTERY LIFE NOT AS ADVERTISED  ONLY 56%NO ANSWER FROM SELLER The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it I‚Äôd definitely buy again. This the real deal fr. Y‚Äôall should try them out! I got my money‚Äôs worth . The battery life last about 2 to 3 hours. Great phone, defiantly recommend. It‚Äôs a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can‚Äôt have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason. It would black out parts of it but I only had that problem with two of my pictures. Other than that for a refurbished phone it‚Äôs pretty good. I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured ""why not?"". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the ""geniuses"" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy. excellent product"
1,"AIMEILI Gel Nail Polish No Wipe Top and Base Coat Set, Shine Finish and Long Lasting, Soak Off Gel Nail Lacquer - 2 x 10ml",Beauty and Personal Care,"It‚Äôs thick, but works good once you get used to it! These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful. the product works great, the only reason i didn‚Äôt give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it‚Äôs very strong. but it works, and works well. I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I‚Äôve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it. smells awful While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side. I love this product it‚Äôs very easy and it last for 14 days Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!! The base coat is horrible. You‚Äôre better off just buying the top coat only. Top coat is average I would say. I‚Äôve done my manicures without the base and they come out better. The base causes the polish to look bumpy. Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done! My top coat bottle came completely empty. I am returning for a replacement but it‚Äôs disappointing! Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation. It's great that you take a picture... but it helps if you show the door # !!! This was dropped off at 104!? NOT 106 I could not get the base coat to dry fully.  I used my UV light 5 times (5 min) and it was still tacky.  I gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway.  The polish I used thankfully was able to dry just fine.  The top coat seemed to dry much better but I won't be using this brand again. Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you‚Äôll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn‚Äôt sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped. Top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses. Returned! Perfect Bottles came leaking from the top. The gel polish I got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact. Why these leaked I don‚Äôt know. I haven‚Äôt used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in. Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky. Pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week. I would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks. Very small but not too bad Nice not that good This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit. First time trying this brand and my last. Very, very thin like a refusal polish, not hard at all. Nails broke easily. I do not recommend this brand. Great product Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I‚Äôve tried! This is a peel off formula. I do follow all the instructions for application and I never use acetone to remove. I soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and I am able to peel of the polish most times I one piece. Now while that its awesome because it removes easily, the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping. I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it. Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed. Is just a oil It is clumpy and didn‚Äôt even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Est√° muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis u√±as. I ordered the base & top coat about 4 years ago & I loved it. I started doing my own nails again so I wanted to try it again...bad idea. The base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping & was too thick & this was only the first use. Maybe they‚Äôve changed the polish since the last time I used it but I won‚Äôt be ordering it again. Works fine doesn‚Äôt last too long though. The base coat good, but the top coat is trash! Starts peeling the next day. Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!! Not even an Ounce I have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days. It doesn't matter what I do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7. I bought this base and top with Amelie gel polish. The topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish. I was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings- unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply, it applied like a literal paste.  There is no good use for this polish and I would like a refund promptly. I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time. This brand doesn‚Äôt hold up, the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected. seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i‚Äôve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set ‚Äúlifts‚Äù you probably just aren‚Äôt doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don‚Äôt need to wipe the top coat :) The item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny. I wish they made them a little bigger for the price. This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again. I really loved this product for the first few months! But recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product! I'm bummed I have to switch it up now because its great quality. Not saying don't buy it-- but definitely be mindful! Very good product. Will buy again. applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove. Bought for my sister who does nails and she didn‚Äôt like it... sadly I like the product it‚Äôs a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased. The gel has a murky purple coating during the day time. It glows green under UV light.  When comparing this top coat to my Kupa inc Top coat there is a huge difference in color. Kupa inc top coat is clear and the Aimeli has the Murky Purple coating. So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy. Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great! Dislike Great base and top coat for gel nails Not bad I've ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it‚Äôs supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!! Great for beginners. Works well I brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small I don‚Äôt blink your eyes This chips and peels off, about like regular nail polish.  It is nothing like ""gel nails"" that you get in the salon, which is what I was looking for. Top coat turns yellow after a few days. I have used the base and top coat 4 times so far, and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days. I have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after, but nothing seems to fix it. This has never happened with other brands of gel top coat I have used. Worked pretty good good product for the price ! I usually get opi but this did the job This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated. This! I can‚Äôt even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to. This must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad. I have been using file off gel polish and I was noticing that I have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off. It wasn't killing my nails, but I figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damage.I bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive. In a week I have had two nails (one on each hand) peel completely off. Its not like the free edge got loose. It just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in, and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where I had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails. One happened in just 3 days. THREE DAYS. I fixed those two jankity nails and I also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week. I can't tell if the top coat is better or not.Now this does have a perk. Its super easy to soak off and remove. Like wow it removes like butter. But, if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week, this is a problem. I can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known US name brand. Will I use the rest of teh bottle? Yes. I am cheap! I also like changing my nail polish color frequently if I can pull that off. This soaks off so easy that I could totally change my polish all the time. But, it also just falls off which means when I am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucks.Edit: I have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish I am really happy with how my nails look. They aren't damaged or sad looking. It really did just bubble up and off. This wouldn't be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it doesn't bubble up and come off easily, but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish.8/8 Update: I keep trying this base/top coat FOOLISHLY because I have it. It keeps performing poorly. Polish just pops off within a day or two of application.  Just spend more and get Gelish. Even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better. Its my own fault for trying it again, but good grief. Peels easy This basecoat is whack. Upon applying it, it‚Äôs separated like crazy. When I applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out. The topcoat is great, not tacky once it‚Äôs been cured and works as advertised. Top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin.  Took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!! Not good dont buy this This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish. Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality. Not so well I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I‚Äôve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that‚Äôs expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn‚Äôt chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next. I am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base, which I bought as Amazon reccommended it. I am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel, but this stuff DOES NOT COME OFF. An hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper, bowls of acetone, and wraps, and it just does not budge. Yet, it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half. Buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors. Lesson learned. I do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail. It will peel up. I can get it to last 7 to 10 days so I guess it's not to bad. Its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up. I am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that I am doing wrong but for the price it's not a bad product. Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don‚Äôt have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light. look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days. Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent. Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed This is my favorite base & top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing. I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky. I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again Not a big fan of this. The base coat never dries (which I know is kind of okay cause it's a base coat) but overall it just takes forever under the lamp. And by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it's weird. Was old Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary. good This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn‚Äôt shine I bought this as my first gel base and top coat. Polish lasted the average two week which was great. However, no matter how careful I applied it, it always left imperfections. Like it shrinks when it sets up under the light. Perfect and smooth going on. Ripples when dried. I tried it with many different colors/brands and always got the same result. I will stick to my new favorite CNC Shellac. Perfect every time Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money. I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days! Easy to apply Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can‚Äôt get the top coat bottle open not sure but it‚Äôs definitely defective You NEED the no wipe top for any of their polishes. I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far Works great. Pretty nice polish. After using this product as instructed I realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy. I am not happy with it. I do like the builder gel but other than that I do not like this product My base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome. Trash !! I love the base and top coat the only problem I‚Äôve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I‚Äôve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they‚Äôre both great and last. i love how it goes on----i got so excited i ordered more----but it chips after a few days---am so very disappointed in that---would not buy again----now that i already have!!! bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations! Long lasting, but a few cons. The product is very runny so you have to be careful, otherwise you'll have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing. I didn't have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later, so that's a plus. The biggest con for me was the removal. I'm not sure this is really ""soak off"". I soak cotton balls in 100% pure acetone and wrap in foil. After 40 minutes, only the top coat budged.... A little. My gel polish, another brand, peeled off very easily, but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock. This is the same thing that happens when I use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them. I love a good base and top coat but I do not want it to be so thick. This product is much thicker than any I have used so far and I had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons I am passing on future purchases. I've been using these for years. Seems like the formula changed lately. Less shiny, doesn't have the same look under the LED light. Not sure how it will hold up. Top coat was clumpy. Purchased 2 x happened to both top coats The top coat was not going on well.  I had to replace the top coat with a different brand but I still use the base coat The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn‚Äôt work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend. Functionally decent. They smell atrocious though, more so than any nail product I've smelled in my life. Acrylic smells better than this stuff, it's like burning plastic straight from the bottle. Needs over 60 seconds under UV to set but that's not a huge deal. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn‚Äôt the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I‚Äôll keep using that. I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure. It's cheap, but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat. Nice gel. As expected. Applies well, dries well with my lamp, is no wipe. My only complaint is that it doesn't get thick or strong enough. This product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily. So with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol. Would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more. You will save yourself time! I've had these for some time now. I do prefer this formula over other brands, HOWEVER, after using for a while, the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky. There is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle, so I hate to throw it away, but I might have to replace them because I can't stand the feeling. Other than that, everything is great. Just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using. This is amazing product. Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting üíÖ nails Polish started chipping on day 1. To be fair, it may have been the UV lamp I was using because I think it was defective; hence the extra 2 stars. I love that you don't have to wipe the topcoat, but no matter how long I soak my nails‚Ä¶ The basecoat will not come off! I have excellent soak off fingernail  polish remover, But the basecoat will not come off  all of the way . I'm going to have to sand it off my nails. Wow! This stuff lasts a very long time, however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time. I buffed my nails first to scratch it too. It might be easier to let the polish grow out! The top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time. This stuff lasts a long time.The base coat didn't even come off, so I just buffed it off with my nail file.I want to give this a great review, the price is so good, it's just so darn hard to remove. I like the other polish colors, but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead. Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn‚Äôt flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it ‚Äúseem‚Äù ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can‚Äôt be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn‚Äôt dry hard after the lamp. It‚Äôs a bit sticky so don‚Äôt touch it. That‚Äôs supposedly normal though. I have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I  used the polish it was amazing!! But the next time I used it it was like the top coat was setting/hardening on the brush. I pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time. But then when I go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush. The was no sticky film once you cure it under the light. I just wish I for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3... I've used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. I really like the base coat I have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail. Sticky, very sticky I don‚Äôt feel like it is quite as shiney  as previous ones I have purchased Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish. I've used several different base and top coats but when I used this one it started peeling off after 3 days. Nice shine but that's a bummer. Doesnt stay on. Really shiny, easy to use, but for some reasons, it turns yellow after a couple days (3-4). I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry! Will buy again Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway. VERY disappointed in this product. I have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead. I missed the cut off to return it, but I honestly would. It didn‚Äôt last more than a week! This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed & cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn‚Äôt completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed! Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend. TerribleQuality make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer. Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that. Good quality, very shiny but to little of product I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won‚Äôt last as long as I‚Äôd like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn‚Äôt bad either! I love this brand these are amazing Unlike some name brand's, this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear. And peels off way too easy. It's ok I trying better that keep your nail polish on. More two day sad I have to do my nails very two days cause of product isn't good. Not worth the money. Excellent base & top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I‚Äôm removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file. I gave it 2 star's because the base coat get hard at all so I order a different kind I hope it works better Bad quality I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part."
2,AKASO EK7000 4K30FPS Action Camera Ultra HD Underwater Camera 170 Degree Wide Angle 98FT Waterproof Camera,Electronics,"I was not impressed with the image quality.  Also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly. Biggest pain to attach to a helmet. But works well otherwise. the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small. We enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs' activities! It fits well into their harness and we get to see them running, swimming, and playing. There are a large number of function and features, so reading the instructions is a must, especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera. It holds up well to use, we've had no problems with it in several months. Would definitely purchase again! Not a good purchase This camera works as advertised and video quality is more than I expected. Great features for the price. The adhesive in some of the mounts could be better. I wish they had special mount for ski helmets. This is a 12 megapixel camera with 4K video. Waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included. Photo quality is less than average compared to my iPhone 6s and I can not get videos to play at all. Overall I would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with. I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out. Bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago. It has been great. Glad we bought it. High quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera.  It‚Äôs holding up well! No negatives I can think of. Works well with phone app. Glad I didn‚Äôt spend the extra money for GP. No need. This thing does it all. Lots of videos on YouTube comparing the two. See for yourself. Does not always stay on.I use it as a dash camera. The WIFI system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing. I found another use for the camera but I would never by this camera again. I love this camera, works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water! Product shipped fast, seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term  yet. Audio doesn't pick up well in the protective case but the video is great. We're still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things. I got this for my husband for a gift, the app didn't seem to work well with his Motorola phone, sinking issues and gave up on it. He has recently uodated to a new Samsung Galaxy 10, so hopefully will be able to get it to work w/it. Good price but takes terrible videos. It‚Äôs not worth the time to even save these videos. Look at the videos on the feedback, I don‚Äôt know why people think this is a good camera. Don‚Äôt waste your time. Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they‚Äôll give you another accessory that you‚Äôll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow. So far I'm impressed with this product. One things for sure no matter what u plan on mounting it to there's an accessory included to do so. I've only had it for a day but so far so good. doesn‚Äôt upload to your computer. Hard to work This little cam is really good i went to the Bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro SD card (not included). I absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this again. Thank you No way that this is 12MP. No. Way! Also (and this was the main reason why I returned it)), the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge. And, for some reason, the only way I could have turned on the camera was if I removed the battery from its compartment and re-insert it. Product works very well.  I use it for fishing and nature hikes. Taking videos hands free is a big advantage. I was impressed with all of the attachment accessories.Excellent value. While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says ""if you replace the battery, date and time will reset"". WT??????? Disappointing didn‚Äôt even work for 30mins in the water and stop working. Don‚Äôt waste your money!!! UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow upOriginal Review:I purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well, go for it, its a nice toy. Otherwise ya pay for what you get. The quality of the camera is about what you would expect for $60. It works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking, water sports or skating.It's a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography. So I bought this item last year for a Xmas gift, and we are now just being able to use it. And the cord doesn't charge the battery Works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with Simonides cameras as well great product great battery life Lots of ways to use this camera. Ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs.  We were surprise at all the features it offered.  Must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera. Gave to grandchild.  Loves to show what he does. Wouldn't work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device, kept saying card in valid,battery's lasted about an 1hr Have not had a chance to give a performance test of it. The box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have (lucky it did not) get damaged. So right now only can say packaging was not good. Will see later this week if camera is any good. It seems like a good camera. I have only used it in the pool so far.  I won't do scuba diving with it until June.The instructins are VERY lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to use.Also, I thought it had WAY to many extra parts that I will NEVER use. Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out. After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much. It's not a bad unit if you're not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras. Bought it for hunting but it's hard to use in a pinch. No comparison to the GoPro.Not many features. No zooming capabilities. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: since posting the above I was contacted by Akaso and offered a partial refund which I received immediately once I agreed to it. Very good customer service. Camera shoots video really well for the price, however the app that goes with it is garbage This is a good value camera we use for family events. Great price for an action cam It's a solid camera pictures are ok. But, they look better on my phone. The batteries die pretty quick I bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle. The reviews I saw made it look impressive. My main camera is a Gopro Hero 4 so the video and audio quality just doesn't compare. If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control. For videos, I just don't see much use but for snapping a picture it does ""ok"". Not what I expected. Did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone.  I needed a Mac computer or video editor to down load my videos. Fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it This product never worked. I took two videos and then it stopped turning on. Being the only camera I took on my trip to Egypt, I was very dissapointed. Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k. This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned. Used it 4 times and now it doesn't work. I hope the added warranty is better than the camera. I bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids.  The biggest negative I have for it is that the camera is not waterproof.  I couldn't get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time.  The worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now I cant use the case and cant seem to find a replacement. DONT DO IT!!! My husband and I got this for our cruise and the SD card wouldn‚Äôt go in the camera. It‚Äôs like a piece was blocking it from going in so we couldn‚Äôt use it at all. Tried to get in contact and nothing. Spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like. I appreciate the quality of this product Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks Positive: product is cheap compare with others in the market. Image and video quality are okay.Negative: wifi features along with app connectivity are bad. Disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage. Sometime it will disconnect from the app but you couldn't work with it manually, unless you give it a hard reset (disconnect the battery). If you want better quality and connection I suggest you go with a GoPro. This item have been open before arriving to me . It box was without its brand new warranty seal, it is very shame why is happening it ? . It is lack of respect to the costumer;  please. Very poor quality overall. Picture, sound, stabilization are all not very good. After reading the other reviews that were positive, I don‚Äôt know if I even had the sam camera. Used it for a few hours and tried to be positive. After that, I returned it and got a Go Pro and I am so much happier. This camera came with so many amazing features and accessories! I love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries. It's super easy to use; my 4-year old can even operate it in the pool. Definitely recommend. My wife and I really liked it. For this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch! We went on a trip to DR and used it for a variety of adventures and I‚Äôm no camera guru at all. Can‚Äôt wait to try it for extreme uses. Used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more. It works great! Sound is quiet if not connected to the iSmart dv app. Battery life last less than 90 minutes. Screen turns black when you are recording, so you can't see what you are filming. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was good at first but for longevity it isn't worth it. If you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you. I'm very happy with this camera. It comes with two rechargeable batteries, several mounts and a water-proof case for underwater footage. I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The ""water proof"" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the ""good stuff"". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary ""action"" video but nothing to write home about. good camera for price  def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue. - Price is awesome! Won't give me a heart-attack in case I lost it while having outdoor activities.- Camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist- Camera is water-proof and operates well in water- Images and videos are stable and good quality for this price- It served us well in a recent rafting trip to Yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter. The camara stop recording for not reason and When it was recording you can not watch all the videos. Only a few. And the others video shows error My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours! The camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality I've seen. Our gopro got water in it and ruined, so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money. This is the same size as a gopro...pretty good quality video. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  We also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options. If you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you! It‚Äôs works great. My only problem with it is that I was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was  to take out the battery. Apon further inspection, it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly. Finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive. But didn't really use it cause it leaked and is now not in my return window! Super disappointed! This camera has ok image quality. It has a short battery life when recording, only about 1 hour. It does not come with a memory card.Rated 3 stars because of the short recording time/ battery life. Image quality for the money was good. Image stabilization not good. Good camera for the money This camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco.  I was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip.  This camera would not work for me.  It continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation. Nice little action cam for the price. Takes good video. Sound is not the best. Really really poor camera and sound quality. Waste of money to be honest. Bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings. The sound quality is the worst. The video quality is just ok. This is a case where you see 4K and think its gonna be great, then you get it and its just OK. It is a small camera and I like that. I can take it with me wherever I go if I need it. I like the battery. And is easy to take pictures and video but I don't like too much the picture quality and color balance. All depends how you want to use it. Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help. I was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess I will look for something else. This is a great alternative to trendy GoPro cameras. It has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more. Good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the GoPro. Not a bad camera just not was i was expecting. Having a GoPro this doesn‚Äôt really compare. After 3 weeks it stopped working.  I returned it for a full refund and got myself a GoPro Hero 5.  It is working well, and longer than this camera.  I would have kept it, had it continued to work. I actually bought 2. I'm changing my original 4 stars to just 2. The quality of the videos I shot and downloaded are very poor. Not the quality of my work! But from the camera. From both cameras. When I first noticed I went and shot with the other camera. Same thing! It's very disappointing. You get what you pay for.... video is extremely jumpy. Picture doesn‚Äôt even seem to be 720p. If you want to record your bike rides, this camera is NOT a good choice. It doesn‚Äôt have any image stabilization. Image is not clear, not 4K This camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures. I've used this during hunts and for other random things. Great camera. Before I could use it for the third time. The clip that holds the buttons in place. The one for the power. Came off!! No it's useless under water or in salt air conditions!! Not happy at all!!! It was a week old at best!! A little shakey when running but overall it's a nice camera for the price Great videos, but the battery life is goes quickly. The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera. Great Color. But battery only lasts about 30 minutes. Quality seems very solid, has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job.  Video quality is really good although I'll admit I haven't spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions.  I'll probably buy a few more, I have a Gen 1 Gopro Hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features. Just check the video for yourself! This is a recording of the Audio/Video Sync Test available on YouTube that I recorded just minutes ago. I have emailed Akaso support. I'll provide an update once I hear back. The charging port no longer works, seems the fins in the actual port bent over? Great value on the dollar. Got this for a trip to the USVI and got some great moments with it This does not include a needed micro card. I purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that's comparable to GoPro. They're incomparable and I wished I would've spent a little extra for a much better quality GoPro. Like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos Great for the price. However, it only takes good video and pictures in high light. Low light settings look terrible. Definitely not 1080 p. Video quality is very poor. Cannot be use for anything proper. Phone take a better video Just bought this for my daughter‚Äôs birthday. She will be using this on our vacation this summer! I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it‚Äôs only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can‚Äôt be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don‚Äôt mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand Image quality and stabilization is bad. Returning the product. Doesn't work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it doesn't battery were fully charge this item sucks Really easy set up Works Great! I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life. Nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all No instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments It‚Äôs okay... I bought a memory card. When I video the screen blacks out after a min. There were bubbles on the screen when I opened it. I liked the camera and had good picture. Unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now I can‚Äôt used I wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does NOT include audio! Only photo/video. Waste of money for me."
3,"ASUS Laptop L210 Ultra Thin Laptop, 11.6‚Äù HD Display, Intel Celeron N4020 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, NumberPad, Windows 10 Home in S Mode with One Year of Microsoft 365 Personal, L210MA-DB01",Computers,"The laptop arrived just in time for school!! Works great. Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly.If you want to take it out of S Mode, go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular Windows Home. Its a free switch. Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard. I love how light weight and compact it is. And the numeric pad as well. So far I‚Äôm pretty happy and content with it. I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far! The number dial is pretty accurate. Sleek design and very lightweight. Perfect product for the average commuter If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the ""easy access"" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that. Amazing product it‚Äôs small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight For 190 bucks, this is perfect. I think tablets are very overrated.  I only like touchscreens on a phone.  This computer is the size of a tablet, incredibly light.  I just wanted something to do my financial stuff, email, shop and casually browse the internet.  I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left. I could probably charge it every other night if I wanted.  I've only had it a couple weeks but I feel very good about my purchase. Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go). It is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate. Light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me. I like the size and for the price it‚Äôs worth buying. small, compact and convenient Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash üóë!!!!!!! You can‚Äôt download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn‚Äôt download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid ‚Äúwindows 10s‚Äù upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac ! My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern. ********************************** 07/24/2021 **********************************being firmilier with windows seizing possession of computers overclocking chip-sets and burning them out first on my listidisabled secure boot and set the supervisor password in bios so windows andits automatic this and automatic that could not inflict further damage to thehardware without firstly obtaining my express permissionnot trusting windows and its most advanced network hacking teqnikesi then proceeded to install my 9 GB linux clone in 10 minutes flathowever i needed windows to register this new computer sos i started windowsafter setup finished without a internet connection it said theres nointernet conection try this troubleshooterwhich arived at the decision that i needed to reset the router (NOT TRUE)  duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhbut why win 10 was updating at chip sizlun full throttle thats the true reason  out of pure curiosity i let this rogue os update it took a full day and a halfbefore i could use edge browser to register in my asusand by the way my last laptop used to do the same thing everytime itupdated until i**************************************************************** disabled the automatic updates  ** by setting the ipv4 gateway address to a bad address ** and unchecking ipv6 protocal  ** in the network configuration dialogue  ****************************************************************2 words braught the micysoft madness to a sqeeky halt********  GRUB-INSTALL *********the wifi chip is a realtekRTL8821CE---the cpu temp is a cool 100 degree farenhite after waking from a nap---and under your control linux will run your chipset at 108 degrees farenheightat idle with bluetooth radio on---in linuxvbox windows 98 running the yamaha SYXG50 soft synthysizer which by the wayrenders the dsp effects in software on 12 miditracks laden with yamaha sysex register 20% cpu utilizationand 117 degree farenheit cpu temp and play hifi music without hickupthis vm cuts the battery life to about 9 hours---also the battery has about 19 hours of secure browsing in it using 2048 bitencryption over bluetooth connect---intense usage such as simultaniuos remote desktop and ssl secure browsing bringtemp to even 120 degree and battery life is 1 hour per 10 percent battery capacity---running linux headless and radio off give you > 40 hours of batteryapache2 server + file sharing + encrypted ssh is on---in linuxthe 14 inch keyboard is backlighted up for your pleasure and for due reasonit is almost impossible to see your key in anything but direct sunlighthowever this is a much needed feature regaurdless  A very usefull feature on the extended keyboard is the well placed home and end keyit follows the standard template for laptops except there is one more row on the far rightwhich has the following keyspower buttonhomepage uppage downendFN*******************************************************************************linux xcfe desktop uses about 1.1 gig of memory out of the installed 4 Gigwith 6 virtual desktops and 5 different apps running*******************************************************************************the charging cord is 6 foot loong and she charges up from 50% to 99% in > a hour*******************************************************************************the integrated video tops out at 1920x1080 and bottoms out at 320x180and refresh rates vary from 60 hz to 120 hzthe battery life sinks exponentialy with increased resolution and refresh rates I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use. The key clicks are loud as you type, and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option, it will come on and off when you don't intend it to. Overall, not bad for the price, but the high rating seems to be misleading. Not sure how much I trust Amazon reviews at this point, I saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing I noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent Zoom is nowadays. Worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day.  Shame as it was perfect for my needs. Quit working after a week It has M.2 which supports NVMe SSD.soldered RAM works pretty fine to me. I buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs. Perhaps I goofed or something, but even a live boot wouldn't take. It is not user friendly. Well worth the price. Small long battery life. Enough capability to support remote learning Cheap Chinese garbage So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the ""use hardware acceleration when available"" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig. Works good, fast, light weight. Outside of the mouse pad "" I like it a lot."" It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage. Remember you get what you pay for. Very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable. Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in ""sleep"", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14"" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it. USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.Since I never intended to ever use the WIN10 installed on it (or even boot it) it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that I could boot from a USB drive that I had Linux Mint installer loaded on.A WORD OF CAUTION for those that are going to install Linux - the current popular install .ISO's don't have the drivers for the WIFI chip! The drivers will have to be installed manually. Bluetooth does however work and I was easily able to link this computer to my iPhone and get out to the internet that way.WORK A ROUND: I ordered a cheap (~$20) ""TP Link"" USB 802.11N (only 2.5Ghz) Wifi adapter, plugged it in and it just works. Maybe someday Linux will have drivers for the built in WiFi chip in this device.While the only CPU'S that Intel makes that are crapper than a Celeron is a Atom I found this on the web:""The Intel Celeron N4020 is one of the most budget-friendly and power-efficient laptop processors. ... As for gaming, the Intel UHD 600 graphics of the Celeron N4020 is one of the weakest solutions. It can be used only for the lightest games.""To sum up the above, it is a very cheap and uses very little power.For its size, the keyboard and screen are ok. The keys have good travel. It has a matte screen.This is a small and very light computer. It is 'snappy' enough surfing the web and running Linux native applications. While I'm not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard USB-C charger.I'll have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it. Running Linux the battery should last as least as long (or longer!) than it does while running WIN10. I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise! This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated. It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it. Recieved yesterday.Still reading info on using micro soft...... I'm use to Google use but this lap top has much more to offer IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET USE TO IT.. Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money! I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it. Excellent for just information support for your job 365 micro soft is useless For the price you can‚Äôt complain it works for basic usage as browsing the Internet. I would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality . Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.  Could barely hear the volume on some things, particularly YOUTUBE.  Finally looked and lo and behold, the speaker are on the bottom. How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear. Perfect for what it has been designed for: internet browsing, music, playing videos. can play Terraria Arrived without windows bootingUpon boot enter BIOS and I get ‚Äúno bootable device‚Äù. You can tell the manual has been beat up. When filling in return on Amazon I find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers. I dislike the confusion with it's programs. Not one to be a ""refresher"" on..after so many years!I feel I made a mistake with choosing this.. Laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price Sound stopped working completely after a week It won't turn on after having it led than 30 days What I expected It‚Äôs cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I‚Äôve never hated a laptop screen so much. It‚Äôs almost like it has a privacy screen on it. Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be. I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown. This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended. I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen & a larger screen. It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable. Much smaller than I imagine but was ok. Easy to carry around, fast enough for my use. Dislike nothing! I use it for work  l like that it was easy to use It's a laptop and it does laptop things. If you need it to do heavy intensive things, it might not do the things.But if you keep your expectations low, you'll probably not be disappointed. The size and range of motion is pretty coolEdit: the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating. The dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve taken some mins to set the computer up I don‚Äôt want to spend more time Screen might put some people off. Battery is phenomenal, it‚Äôs silent, and the audio is fine. Perfect for on the go."

Returned it, it's been two weeks and I'm being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process. The body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s, including the trackpad. Get another gaming laptop, the ROG zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better GPU & CPU and an all aluminum chassis. Basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the Google browser because it may make it unstable. This will be my last Acer. I expect notebooks to last around  3 years and that is when you actually use it. I used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all. In fact I just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out. I would not recommend this product. GREAT little laptop. Performs well. I do mostly work on it (Microsoft Office, Audio editing on Audacity, minor video editing and some music composition with Sibelius) and it runs flawlessly. Occasionally I travel and play games on it (league of Legends and World of Warcraft) and it runs those just fine too (WoW on lower graphics settings). only down side to this machine is there's VERY little memory. Make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage, or an external hard drive if you go with this machine. Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing This is a great laptop for the price, but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad, it's on the left hand side below the keyboard, which makes no sense.  It should be centered or more on the right.The screen color is also a bit bright, so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that.  Also this thing is kinda heavy. This is not bad, but I would not buy it again. The speakers are horrible and under the computer. making it hard to hear (I am deaf) and you have to pick up the computer to hear them. The cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on. Drives me crazy. No CD Rom either.  :( Love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible?  At least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers! Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of ""S"" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works... I do not spend a lot of time on the computer. I purchased the computer so I could do some personal writing. I like the fact that it had Microsoft Office installed. I did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the Microsoft store.  To download other apps, like zoom, I had to disable the Microsoft security system, which cannot now be reactivated on my machine.  But as far as general use of the computer, it has been great. Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review on this one. I have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop, I can't believe it just died on me after 14 months. I didn't get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop cost...again, inexpensive laptop. I expect slow, etc. but not death. Easy to set up, liked the keyboard. I added another 4 GB memory.  Just a nice overall laptop. It is a lot smaller screen, keyboard, etc., than I had before.  Though I had an Acer Aspire before.  I don't like it, probably will return it, and wouldn't recomment it for older people. Nice laptop for the money. I still don't like Windows. Battery life is lousy My lab top has quit working. It will not restart it is froze & my mouse will not work it won‚Äôt let me do anything For the price point its a great laptop. First I added another 2GB RAM for under $20 and upgraded. Before I start with the positive one big negative. When the laptop goes to sleep mode, it take 25-40 sec before it wakes up. It's very strange. Its not a traditional hard drive. I didnt change any settings. I have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on. Pretty annoying. Other than that screen quality is phenomenal. Speed is more than adequate for MS office apps . It can also handle streaming and 8-10 browsers at a time.  For school, work , anything non hardcore this is a good laptop. Sound quality I aways use my bluetooth headset anyway. Sound is bit more towards the stereo sound. I am sure that can be adjusted, just havn't played with it.Like others have said, you cannot go wrong at this price point. I just hope it lasts and dont bog down or slow down with updates and what not.... this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to ""accidentally"" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice. I purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the Cricut Desgin Space for my Cricut machine. My old laptop was just running too slowly and I needed an upgrade. First off, the price is amazing, and I'm fully aware that you get what you paid for but I feel like I got MORE than I paid for with this. I don't know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general user:PROS:- The look and design is very very sleek- Fairly lightweight- The screen resolution - AMAZING!- It seems fast so far- The battery life is very good. I've been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and I still have 1/4 battery life left.- It does come downloaded with Windows 10 S Mode however there's literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a STUPIDLY EASY four step process to permanently get out of S mode. It was the first thing I did (based on other reviews) and have no issues. IT WAS FREE TO DO AND TOOK 2 MINUTES!!CONS:- Caps Lock/Num Lock do not have an indicator light. I'm already finding this very annoying but I use a USB keyboard most of the time anyway so it's fine.- The sound is awful. If you're using this laptop for streaming, games, etc. you will need headphones. No seriously... it's really bad. The quality is okay but it does not get loud AT ALL.Overall with a couple of days of use I'm impressed with this!!! Purchase ASAP if you're looking for an affordable general use laptop :) I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE. This laptop was overpriced. Screen quality is decentTouch screen not reallyThis isn‚Äôt a gaming laptopTurn off the wifi so it doesnt interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tablet/computer. Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily. It is fast and cheap. However, some technical issues:- S mode is horrible. Got rid of it immediately.- My powerpoint screen recording function would not work. Called Microsoft and they were very helpful. They rolled back my display driver to Microsoft Basic and worked perfectly, but then the computer would not recognize my second screen. Called Acer, and they told me they didn't have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party (Answers By) that wanted to charge me $99 to fix the issue...- For some reason, the internet was really slow. Played with two different routers I had. It was still slow even with a tri-band router and no other devices connected to the internet. Then, I connected to the guest wifi I had set up and it worked perfectly. I suspect this may be a driver/software issue.For the price, it is hard to beat this, but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from ACER... THIS PC WAS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT WORK I OPENED CASE THEY COULD NOT FIS IT  POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT DOD NOT BUY THIS PC  DO NOT BUY THIS PC. VERY POOR SUPPORT FROM AMAZON AND ACER Product wouldn‚Äôt work out of the box, and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return. I love everything about this laptop. Especially the built in Alexa. It's so sleek and stylish. My daughter told me it looked just like her MAC laptop. Best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features! Arrived late, Speaker volume is low.great LT for price! Won‚Äôt find anywhere else. Stopped working after 4 months of light use. The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.! Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix. Product arrived on time and was as advertised.  No surprises. Nothing special about this. Recent buy, no issues thus far. Appreciate the graphics card vs the ""newer model"" with the integrated card. Helps with some lighter games and other graphics-intensive apps. Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless. It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity. Everything is good for the price but  the volume  is to low... l had to return and get an apple instead. Even though it is double the price. This is a nice laptop for the price.  No issues so far at all.  I did need to take it out of S mode in order to install Zoom which is basically mandatory these days. The batter life is trash, and heats up fast I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8"" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first. built in camera and mic not working Computer works well. Still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer. Worked fine for 13 months of occasional use, and then out of nowhere, the motherboard failed--just outside of the mfr warranty window. Piece of junk! I absolutely love this laptop key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won‚Äôt purchase Acer again. I purchased this product based on many reviews .  After waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing, I called Acer support.  This thing would not set up Windows.  There is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was.  Am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back.  Pure frustration.  This thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so.  Recommend you buy something else. overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback Computer works great, just as advertised, good value, would buy again Works exactly how I expected it to and does everything I need it to do. A very good laptop for the price given. I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming‚òπÔ∏è I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far.  I've only had it set up for less than a week, so I can't really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great.  I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I'm just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my ""non-thechie"" side of the screen.  It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.  The best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it's great.  I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore.  It's really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear.  The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.  I love this computer. Works like a charm Keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while. Specially the one you use most. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great computer I bought this computer for a new full time remote position. The computer is great for VERY BASIC NEEDS. Only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet. I needed to have 10+ tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up. If you need something faster, I would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for $200 more. Well worth the difference. Have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what I need done.Also, I plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer, and once I unplugged it, I could not get the touch pad to work anymore, so it is a good thing I am returning it as it also had this alternative issue. backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this ""Gortana"" which pops up all the time. it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse This has the potential to be a good computer, but Acer ships this in S mode. Windows 10 Home cannot be activated. Running SLUI 4 will open the installation ID, but Microsoft cannot activate that number.  The agent said I needed to call Acer.  I called the toll-free number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call Microsoft (whodathunk?) or send it to Acer to be ""repaired.""  It was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired! Thanks to Amazon-- it is being returned.  Run  Away. I purchased this computer for my small business job. Within two weeks of use, the down key came off. Amazon's response is to glue the key down, which is ABSURD. You can't just glue a key down, which I explained, but they said that is all that they could do. They would not replace the computer. I purchased this laptop for school / social media / youtube / browsing & i absolutley love it. No complaints so far. It‚Äôs really good I actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great Not lasting more then 1hr! And lagging when you unplug the cable. Still working on this. Hope to up my rating if we can get things working. First experience with the system was very positive. Issue is that on day two I saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen: ""Go to settings to Activate Windows"". Settings says ""We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Troubleshooter says ""Something interrupted our troubleshooting."" Called Acer support and was told they would mail me Windows Installation USB memory stick. Waited a little over one week and asked for status update. Was told that USB install media was not available, and I should contact Microsoft for activation. Entered last four digits from activation error message and was told I would need a new product key. Contacted Acer support again, and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix; which could take 15-20 business days, plus shipping time. Briefly considered returning to Amazon, be decided to try the Acer service option. Will be awhile before we get it back. The physical device is very nice.  Lighted keyboard good EXCEPT no indicators for Caps Lock nor Num Lock.  That is unfortunate (what, Acer saved $2 to not include two little leds). Bluetooth non-operating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot.  Touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks - another thing to troubleshoot...  Hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine. We got this as a grad. gift for our grandson. Great price, great laptop & fast delivery!! Flimsy.  Returned it. Finally unboxed this laptop.. have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it's a refurbished laptop advertised as 'new' or sent a used one.. will update this review when I've used it a bit..if I don't return it... It very light weight but not very fast. Screen quality it‚Äôs good. Purchased this for a high school kid. Does what it needs to do. The base model is ok. I like that you can upgrade this in the future. They included the bracket for a secondary drive. I will be buying more of these for clients Works well for school Wish I had read I to description more No sd card or disc reader So cost wasn‚Äôt as well as I thought after buying external  readers Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product. Can‚Äôt complain about an Acer product for the price and quality! I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time A good performance. To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250. Works fine.  Sound could be louder. I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc. This laptop is great and I had it for months, but when I first got it I had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it. The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren‚Äôt compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn‚Äôt seem to work anymore and I‚Äôm terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that. Not good as described. Not hapoy with battery performance. It's a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps. Also it comes on S mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for FREE!  Go in settings > application > Switch to windows 10 mode Good laptop but ended returning, found one better. Cheap laptop.  You get what you pay for.  No hard drive.  No cd player.  Mouse board difficult to control. The product key on the laptop was bad and so I could not activate it. Acer customer support was horrible, told me if I had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since I bought it from Amazon I'm pretty much on my own. Last time I buy this brand. Machine is a really great budget machine. I got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine. In the standard form, it was nothing great. Adding more RAM woke it up a lot. Better overall performance.The back-lit keyboard is huge plus for working at night. Screen resolution and clarity is great as well. I had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use. While I am used toto Apple products, I tried troubleshooting my Windows laptop, even tried restarting in Safe Mode to troubleshoot, without resolve. I even performed Windows Recovery. Still, no resolve. Confused, I thought, That‚Äôs okay, I am within the allotted time to return my laptop. So, I requested a Return and opted for a new replacement (vs. refund). I was careful to ensure I remained in compliance with the Return Policy as set out by Amazon and followed the instructions, step-by-step. I downloaded the RA# and UPS label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed. The following day, I checked the Amazon website for status of my return, only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared! I didn‚Äôt think much of it as more than a temporary technical error, as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return. Having carefully followed instructions per Amazon‚Äôs Return Policy and with my Proof of Shipment Receipt from UPS, I was confident it would work itself out. NOPE. Evidently not. More than two weeks later, NO REPLACEMENT, NO REFUND, NO RESPONSE. ‚Ä¶NO COMMUNICATION. And, Four to Five text messages later to the Seller (via Amazon website) ‚Äî along w/ submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking# ‚Äî STILL NO RECORD OF iNITIATION OR TRACKING OF MY RETURN. The History of my messages to Amazon / Seller and my Return Request are also *POOF* GONE!What the $&@! NO PHONE NUMBERS; Just the runAround.Apparently, I am now out $500 ‚Äî AND a laptop. ‚Ä¶Fabulous.KNOW THE RISK! This laptop is 14""!!! I'm soooo angry! This laptop is great, its affordable and have a bunch of cool features. The only issue is that it is extremely low. you definitely need a headset or speakers. I have to lift the device to my ears to hear if I dont have any of these available.  I have had it for a year and so far so good. I love it.  Easy to work with screen is small. whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook, but the processor is fast and all.. I thought i was upgrading, but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters. I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE. Cons:-over heats-speakers are horrible can barely hear videos (had to install an additional app to make sound louder)-computer lags a bit (shouldn‚Äôt lag for the price of it)- not recommend for the pricePros:-Good quality when watching videos etc I like everything about this computer EXCEPT THE VOLUME-YOU CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ON IT! dislike the teeny hddlike I can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it OUT of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price Not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section. The graphics are so so. Worse than my last Acer. Overall 4 stars. Good computer. I‚Äôm using it to create elearning.When I tried to remove the computer from Windows S mode, I realized that the computer did not come with a product key. What this means is in order to remove S mode, you have to buy Windows Home or Pro and use the product key to remove S mode. I wish they would have just told me that! I contacted the company via amazon chat, they said I needed to contact the manufacturer. They gave me a phone number. There is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well. No success.I ended up just buying the downloadable Windows home version and used the product key to remove S mode. I also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint, word, excel, etc.That's a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer. Just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase. Was a great computer until I had used it twice for Zoom and now the speakers no longer work.  If I figure out why I will update. When I first received this laptop everything seemed great, I was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going-- I very quickly realized, however, that this computer was EXTREMELY slow for my tastes.  Even with no background programs, simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time.  In my opinion, a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly, not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more.  This is ultimately preference, but I'm sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster.  Returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010's and it runs much better than this one. I had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm loving it so far. It's lightweight, sleek, and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room. It boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on. I mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that. The only negative that I can think of is the placement of the speakers. The speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max. Other than that the laptop is a great budget buy. Displeased. Some black (looks more like green) dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen. Looks like some kind of defect. The laptop was purchased at the start of September and didnt see usage until about the 25th of September, which means In about two months this situation happened. Was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence. I‚Äôm not sure if it has ‚Äútouch screen‚Äù. Poor quality. Cheap, just like the price. Laptop is unlikely to last you long. Charging port was junk.On the positive side, it is very light and small.If you choose to purchase this laptop, best of luck to you. The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD. I was told I was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since I have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one.. very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that I love this laptop. The screen is a great size. It‚Äôs light weight not heavy and very sleek. Good laptop, I don't do anything out of the ordinary.  Does what a laptop is made to do.  I stayed with ACER because my previous laptop was ACER.  If it didn't lose the 'W' key function I'd still be using it, but would buy a new battery because unless it's plugged in it randomly shuts down, bad battery. So, the new laptop had a new surprise.  The sound volume is very poor.  Now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes.  I have to not recommend for this very reason. Absolute garbage I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware. Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed. bought this for my brother laid up with back surgery-easy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly! All ok so far cute unit--but does not work after two hours =  black screen & deadmay i have a replacement unit? I love this computer, but the mouse pad doesn‚Äôt work. Had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it. But otherwise great product Good quality, use it to work from home and meetings and classed. I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy. I‚Äôve had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer won‚Äôt work unless it‚Äôs plugged in. I originally got it for college, but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home. I haven‚Äôt spilled anything or dropped the computer so I don‚Äôt know what the problem is. Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good. Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality. I baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad won't work. Scam ALL ELSE OK I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic. Considering I had a Toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems, I expected better of this. But two months into it the touch pad and cursor died. Fortunately I still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functional.I don't have the time or patience to fool around with a return. When I buy a product I expect it to work. We'll see how long it lasts. Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help. Extremely happy with this. I have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better. Glad i found this."
5,"Ailun Glass Screen Protector Compatible for iPhone 11/iPhone XR, 6.1 Inch 3 Pack Tempered Glass",Electronics,"good fit Two days after I put in on my phone( btw) it was easy to put on! The screen savor shattered. Not a strong screen protector, drop one and it will crack. Installation and everything else was fine though. Good thing it comes with 3. Pretty good for screen safety, but the installation provided a lot of room for mistake. Solid product tho This literally does NOT fit iPhone XR screens (not wide enough to cover the screen). I'm not sure why, but I've used Ailun products for few of my older phones and I never had any problems. But, this one for my XR - It's not covering the edges of the phone. It leaves about 3mm and should be more than enough to damage the phone when you drop the phone Third time purchasing these. These are the best screen protector I have ever used. The glass is durable and lasts long time unless I drop my phone on some hard surface. It has protected my phone multiple times from accidents. It was easy to set up and definitely has protected my phone. We have purchased it for other phones. Came in broken and covered in dust I've had this cover on my iPhone XR for about 2 years now. I have dropped my phone plenty of times in those two years, but when I put the first cover on from this pack that I recently bought and dropped my phone, my actual screen cracked for the first time during these 2 years. Of course it was right before I wanted to trade in my XR for a newer phone. Now I get nothing for my trade in thanks to the lovely cracks on my screen. :( This is a repeat purchase- just clicked on buy again and they arrived. The box sizing is correct however the screen protectors are noticeably small!  Not an Amazon mistake- must be the company changed the size in the last month or two. Maybe 1mm smaller than the last pack I bought-  so annoying! Does not give full coverage and my thumb catches on the cover each time I swipe up. The next very nxt day, the screen protector cracked. He dropped it on the kitchen floor. I wouldnt buy this one! Love it. Without it My phone would be cracked for sure Great product unfortunately one of my screen protectors arrived cracked This is a very good glass  phone cover Said it‚Äôs compatible with the iPhone X, but it‚Äôs too long for the screen. I‚Äôve had it on for less than a month and the screen protector is already shattered in numerous places. Do not buy. The glass isn‚Äôt the correct shape or size, it‚Äôs a little off but it‚Äôs serviceable. Horrible product. Impossible to keep lint out when installing. 3 screen savers glass, 3 cleaning wipes, 3 drying wipes and 3 adhesive tac to remove any lint. easy to apply but be quick as the glass starts to adhere fairly quickly. Loke Easy to install. Three in a package is the bonus. Not the advertised size and only came with 2 of the 3 glass screens. Easy to install and reasonably priced. Have used for a while and provide good protection. Doesn‚Äôt really stick well. terrible quality , cracked when applying , DO NOT BUY too big not for iphone 11 pro Maybe if I wasn't a clutz and didn't drop my phone 10 times a day, I wouldn't need this product. However, I do! It ships fast and it does the job. I have never had my actual screen crack. So in the description it says it will fit the iPhone 11‚Ä¶. Well it does, however it is smaller than the screen size. Frustrating. Cracked the first day I put on and I never dropped  my phone! Only needed 2 ... over bought, my bad Slightly short but works well all three cracked from regular use no falls useless don't buy Works great and for the price you can‚Äôt go wrong. Very pleased! It did not fit iPhone 11pro very well The don‚Äôt fit the phone fully as they should Works great Garbage!!! Crack very easily. Went through 3 in a month. Less than a month Considering the price this is a good deal but it is very narrow and doesn‚Äôt really cover up the sides These glass screen protectors are horrible quality and crack at the slightest bit of impact. Worst screen protector I've ever used. Would give it zero stars if I could. Works super well and super easy to put on It fit okay. Was easy to put on. I only received 2 protectors and it stated it was 3 in the pack which is what I really needed! Shattered in less than one week when I dropped my phone on carpet from a height of three feet or less. I‚Äôm quite disappointed with the quality. Definitely cheap‚Ä¶ had the screen on for less than a month and haven‚Äôt dropped phone once or anything else destructive happen.. randomly has a small crack bottom left corner that splits in 3 directions‚Ä¶ oh well The glass doesn't fit my phone...it hangs over the side and the case won't fit on. Uggg. It broke under my thumb. It cracks so easy, I was clicking my screen with my thumb, and it just cracked. What a waste of money Only complaint is the wipes were dry other than that üëåüèΩ These use to be stronger but now it‚Äôs not as better. It cracks easily so you will need to replace more frequently It‚Äôs ‚Äúok‚Äù. Be sure to read all the instructions and have all pieces ready. Once it‚Äôs down...you can‚Äôt unstick it and do it again to adjust the glass if it was off centered or crooked. You get one shot w each piece. Glad there was 3 in the box. It‚Äôll work for what I need it to do but it‚Äôs not flawless. It didn‚Äôt fit my phone.  The item was to small It fit but the tabs for lining up the glass were weak and didn't work well It was slightly too large for an iPhone 11, but I could still get my case around it.However, the touch stern barely worked once it was on. I‚Äôd have to hit some spots four or five times.5/5 for easy install. 1/5 for everything else. After 1 month of usage Bubble got created. As it as just crossed return limit, I could not placed return request. Did not expected such experience. i like it but it cracks easily Fits. But the glass cracks so easily‚Ä¶. I barely set my keys on top on my phone and the side of the screen protector cracked and pieces off glass chip off. Not my favorite. They‚Äôre easy to install, but quite thin This brand I use a lot ..but I bought some recently and they crack bust Broke very easily both pack for different i phones üì± i don‚Äôt recommend Dropped my phone about 3ft from the ground if that far one time and the screen saver cracked instantly. But in good faith, it did save my phone screen Disliked that one of my screens was cracked on one side Just what I wanted Very easy to install and has worked great so far. Very good screen protector I just wished they sent a plastic suction Cup My phone fell from a short ledge and barely effected the screen protector but let my real screen shatter. No warranty or help from the company. Do not buy. I just received a 3 pack of Ailun Glass Screen Protectors for a 6.1 inch display today and watched the Youtube video regarding installation steps. On the first try, after finally getting the wet and dry wipes open and barely getting the Ailun Dust-absorber open,  I applied the screen protector, but there were still multiple medium-sized bubbles on the screen that I could not remove using my fingers. On the second try, the ""wet"" wipe was completely dry when I opened it and I could not even open the Ailun Dust-absorber; but then was able to carefully place the Screen Protector on the iPhone screen. There are still 2 small bubbles on the screen which I could not remove using my fingertips.Even though the finished product does appear to be secure on my display screen, I ended up wasting the first screen protector and finding quality issues with the second included wet wipes and both included dust-absorbers Leaves a gap between a my case and the edge of the tempered glass. So basically you feel the edge any time you swipe up The completeness of the kit, with wipes, guides, and such is great. The application is almost magic in it automated attachment without air bubbles. However, the surface is easily scratched. FAR more easily scratched than the glass it is supposed to be protecting. Obviously doing it‚Äôs job but at the cost of quickly looking worse than if it were not on the screen at all. Well I dropped my phone and it didn‚Äôt crack the screen so it‚Äôs doing good so far These are terrible! The wet cloths are totally dry and when I put the protective sheets on the phone I cannot use the touch screen without really hitting with pressure. I tried twice snd finally gave up. I used this for my iPhone 11. My phone has been thrown on rocks and such. The protector has broken but my phone stays untouched! Definitely does it‚Äôs job The wet cleaning wipes were dry as a bone It's just barely too large, so the plastic sticks over the side of the phone, catching on things (and pulling up) and not fitting in the phone case. Seems ok but I haven‚Äôt installed it yet I really like these I think the price is also good you just need to concentrate to not get it crooked because I almost did that. I would totally recommend buying if your clumsy like me and cracks their phone screen a lot They are OK and they look great, very easy application and very clear.  The only problem is they are very easy to crack. great protector It makes the screen look foggy and I can‚Äôt figure out how to clean it. So far is a really good compact screen protector would recommend The screen protector for the XR is  very smallI am extremely disappointed The screen protector delivered does not fit perfectly on the iPhone 11. longer than the screen and edges protrudes really bad. I ordered this set of 3 screen protectors and have used all 3 in less than 3 months. They all have had thin cracks after normal use. Only one drop. I think the quality is very poor and I am disappointed. Would not purchase again for fear it is not protecting my glass screen. It is not durable and cracks very easy. Very hard to install as I had to stick and unstick three times. I then dropped my phone from the sink and the screen protector cracked badly. I am now on my second piece. My screen is fine though thankfully. If you want something long lasting do not buy this product I have been through five of them and less than six months. At first I thought it was me but it‚Äôs happening to my wife as well. If you look at them wrong they will crack. I‚Äôm constantly replacing them do not buy this product. Did't like...does't cover all screen... Easy to install and good value for the money Although it protects your screen this item cracks  easily They stick good but break super easy don‚Äôt buy if it mint for a little kid Three came in the package. One came cracked, one was not sticky. Was able to use one of the three in the package. Cracked in a matter of a couple days- do not even remember dropping phone TBH. Very good quality at an affordable price. Easy to install Really liked this product. The quality is great at an affordable price. These are very thin and scratch and crack super easily the item worked well. it looks so much better than it was before. Not a good product I ordered these because I couldn‚Äôt remember the other brand I used before. This protector doesn‚Äôt hold up as well. Put it on my new phone yesterday, today the screen protector cracked. I didn‚Äôt even drop my phone, bang it from my pocket or anything. I have no idea where this crack came from but it chipped in the middle of the left side and has a hair line crack running across the screen. Hasn‚Äôt even been a full 24 hours yet. This must have happened from my keys in my pocket maybe? Ive had other glass protectors in the past and they withstood years of bangs and falls... not sure what‚Äôs going on with this one.EDIT: I decided to change the screen protector and I had to go through my last two because the first one I applied left my phone covered in a tremendous amount of lint that it was not even redeemable. This is unusual because I have never had an issue applying my screen protectors. So I use the last screen protector in the pack and as I peeled the plastic cover off I realized the screen protector was already covered in black lint. So I used tape to clean the glue covered glass before applying and it worked a little better but still have some lint under my glass.SAFE TO SAY I WILL NOT BE BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY ANYMORE! I watched several videos on installation and it was helpful. the fingerprint reader is heavy i dont know why,... i followed the steps but still heavy.my son knock my phone down on the floor and left a bug crack on the sceen protector,  i was anxious that he might actually broke my phone screen..  but he didnt.this protector does the job. This product is quality.  Easy to install, no glare, right to spec.  I highly recommend to all. Great quality product! Garbage These will do in a pinch, but they crack down extremely easily. I‚Äôm not someone who is usually hard on phones, but I‚Äôve used all three in a month‚Äôs time. I will not be purchasing this product again. Not the easiest to install. Easy to break. My wife and daughter have already broken theirs. I think these suck and are not a great fit. If you aline the top or sides, the covers dont make it all the way to the other side, so they look terrible.  They are too small for the iphone 11 screen. I would not buy again and i would not recommend them to anyone. I feel like it was a complete waste of money.  3 screen protectors that don‚Äôt fit.  What to do with them now‚Ä¶. Wrong size It is too slim to fully cover the screen. I had to move the screen over to read. Would not recommend Easy to attach, looks good but to small. Leaves about 1/4 inch around Most recent batch has hairline fractures after ‚Äúnormal‚Äù phone drops...  glass can splinter off if phone is dropped too. The Upper right-hand corner of the screen protector cracked in less than 24 hrs.  There was no fall or bump of the phone so I'm not sure why that happened. Also, I couldn't get the air bubble out of the top. Next time I'll try installing it from top to bottom to see if that makes any difference.  I'll keep using it for now. Hopefully, the other two protectors work better. They hold up great. The only downside is they aren't the most smudge-resistant. This product said it would fit the iPhone 11 and it is too long. The glass edges hang off the side and cover up the speaker and camera on the front. üëéüèª Wouldn‚Äôt buy again because were wipes are dry. I have to use my own alcohol to clean prior to use. Do NOT buy for the iphone 11. It is slightly too big. The edges and sides are sticking out, and I am unable to put my case on the phone without it pushing the screen protector off I‚Äôve bought screen protectors in the past that last months without cracks but these are not at all durable and barely last a week. I went through all three in the pack in just under two weeks because of how often they crack / chip from minor occurrences Easy and cheaper than paying for someone to install!!! Worth it! easy to install, but seems to have areas around My screen that are very noticeable that it is not sticking to the screen. Typical installation, wipes included. Thick glass, feels safe. I like this screen protecter, but when I dropped my phone it kinda scratched my actual screen but would totally recommend if your not clumsy. Works for screen protection but it cracks every time your phone hits the ground. I‚Äôve used others that were more durable doesn;t fit from edge to edge. Exposes too much screen left unprotected Doesn't work with Apple cases. These do not cover enough of the phone! Dropped the phone and sure enough it cracked on the sides where the cover doesn‚Äôt cover and has spread through my phone I‚Äôm on my second screen protector in two weeks. Doesn‚Äôt take much for these to crack or start shattering on an edge. Looking into new options. Supposed to come with 3 only came with 2. Works fine but sucks Cracks easily. Have already been through 2 of the 3.Could also use an install bracket to make centering it easier on the phone. It was delivered quickly & easy to apply. It had instructions to register the product but the option was not in the website. I always keep tempered glass on  my phones and have had great experiences with it in the past but this breaks with the  tiniest of falls.  I already have gone through two of the glass covers and honestly have had miniscule drops of for example standing up and it slipping out of my pocket onto the carpet from a height of 1 to 2 feet or less and it keeps breaking.  I contacted the company and did not get a reply.  I am on my last one now but would rather spend a bit more on one that works.  :( Difficult to install, no guide, bubbles. It also broke within one week. I do not recommend this product. Easy to install and didn't have any bubbles. Comes with 3 which is great and instructions are easy to follow. Only on a few weeks, and it‚Äôs bubbling up around the top of my phone. It‚Äôs Good overall it‚Äôs alright, the package doesn‚Äôt come with any guider to help place the screen protector and while it is supposed to come with wet and dry wipes to clean your phone screen, both of the wipes were dry. i‚Äôm not that impressed by the quality but okay for price. It is kind if difficult to put on, it took me two tries but its a good screen protector Product was nice. Went on easy with no glare. First one was cracked on edge  second one was good so did what I needed Used for an iPhone XR and works great.  Becareful to align the top first and slowly lower the glass or else you'll be lifting it back up to fix how misaligned it ends up. 3 protectors for a cheap price is excellent.  The glass is slightly smaller than the overall screen but that helps when using screen less cases as to not interfere with the case. Easy install. Fits perfectly. Highly recommended. Easy to install and good but the price is little high for me It‚Äôs nice, easy to install but did not cover the screen for my iPhone XR completely there‚Äôs exposed screen all the way around protector that‚Äôs not even covered when I put my phone cover on‚Ä¶ Difficult to install. Buy one with a guide to get it in place properly. Could have used a better alignment template/sticker.  Glad 3 screen protectors included. So easy to apply and it‚Äôs strong and has survived many falls already"
6,"Amazon Basics Ergonomic Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Adjustable Height/Tilt, 360-Degree Swivel, 275Lb Capacity - Black",Home and Kitchen,"I originally bought this for my home office and used it sparingly - just when I had to do bills or something. Worked fine for several months. Then, the pandemic hit and then my household switched to WFH. Within a few months, the chair was destroyed. The seat was like sitting on wood (no cushion left) and one of the casters which held a wheel split open and it could no longer support a wheel. After that, the chair was unstable and we had to toss it. It starts to fall apart in a year. You will get visible wear and tear in the first 6 months.I have it for 2 years and the upholstery feels completely flat now almost no volume. I can feel its hard structure on the seat and back support. I assume it will be unusable for me soon. So, buy with this timeline in mind. It is cheap though. And easy to assemble. Good wheels.If you have access to seat parts, you can renew the top as the base stays very sturdy and good. Inexpensive office chair as expected Great chair, the only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that the left side was slightly misaligned which made getting the bolts into place difficult. Same with the chair plate, one of the bolt holes was just slightly off. Great seat Poor Quality , Broken within 3 Months Very good value for the price compared to more expensive options Quite simple to assemble, easier than other office chairs that I have done. Generous dimensions, especially in the ‚Äòseat‚Äô area, that make it comfy. Good for home office or casual-office setting.Great value for the money. I`m only five foot for inches tall, this is chair adjust just right for me. Poor workmanship. The chair was great at first, considering the price, but the seat cushion starts to hurt after a couple of months. Very easy to install and beru durable arrived in only 2 days I got the chair a couple months ago and an internal component snapped.  Worthless garbage.  Glad I had a protection plan to get a refund, but I'd avoid this if I were you.  It's a big hassle to get a box big enough to return this, so just buy a half decent chair. Nice and comfortable! Would have been better with a back that leaned. Boxes were left on my mom's driveway without even a doorbell ring! She had to drag them inside. I bought this nearly 2 years ago for a home office I never used until the recent covid lockdowns and I needed to work from home... It was comfy and fine for a couple of weeks then started losing pressure in the height adjustment every time I would lean back or turn just right.It is now headed to the curb! Works well. Hard to get any stains out so I recommend go put a blanket or cover over it I was hoping this chair would lean back more.  Even on the loosest tension setting, the chair is rigid.  This chair is so much less comfortable than the previous office chair I bought from amazon, which was about $30 cheaper and is unfortunately now out of stock.  Now that I've assembled the chair, I don't imagine returning it.  The whole experience makes me think that it's just better to buy chairs in a brick-and-mortar store. Pretty easy to assemble, serves its intended purpose. Not fancy, simply comfortable, relative support, a little light in the a**, but otherwise ok for price. Overall it was decent ergonomics and good support, but the leather was very stiff and making it very hot and sticky after sitting on it for a little bit This purchase was a gift for our granddaughter. She promptly put the chair together largely by herself. She has reported that it is very comfortable and she is very happy with it. Great chair See title. Started to fall apart less than a year after purchase -at that time it has been used the equivalent of 8 month of 2/3 hours per day use.  Then it completely disintegrated when COVID-19 time came and it got subjected to daily use for a couple of months. Assembly was moderately easy but very disappointing when the last step, installing the back, was impossible because the back was too wide to fit between the arm rests and therefore could not be installed.  If I keep the chair, I will have to improvise by own back rest.  I would like to have the manufacturer sent me a back the will bit. Nice size with very comfortable lower back support. The seat cushion is not comfortable you can feel the center plate hosing.  The back cushion is also not comfortable. The magnetic wheels dont work,i kept fallint off the chair Great comfy chair nice unit Quality is good but the back support doesn‚Äôt move Very nice chair for the money. Super comfortable and looks good. Love the chair the the adjustment. Great purchase The chair is not bad for short periods of us, but if it is used for long periods of sitting, it becomes very uncomfortable. I bought the chair because it is inexpensive, but I am in the chair all day and it quickly becomes uncomfortable. I should have paid for more for better quality. Not a value for Money!! Junk.  The screws won‚Äôt tighten and strip easily.  Not a solid piece of furniture.  I am a petite lady and it‚Äôs almost too small for me.  I feel like it‚Äôs going to break everytime I sit on it.  Too much of a hassle to return due to working at home from Coronavirus and it‚Äôs better than nothing. Tried to find ERGO-Nomically Correct chair for someone with back problems. And they were astronomically expensive. So for my budget this one looked like it would be ok to sit on and when I stood up to work it would be comfortable to put my knee on for balance. Etc. This is good for now. I'm finding more and more that anything from ""Amazon Basic"" has really, really good assembly instructions. Never had a problem with readability, clarity, or ease of assembly. This was no different, went together like a dream. It's a handsome chair, and comfortable. Took a star off because although the chair reclines (or is locked in place vertically), there is no way to lock the chair at various angles of recumbency. So, you have to apply pressure with your legs constantly to not be sitting bolt upright. It works just fine, just something to note as you are shopping around - that feature is not as standard as I thought it was. The chair was good at first, but after only 3 weeks of use, I've noticed that its hydraulics will lower by itself. I am only about 5'7 120lbs. so its not like I am putting a bunch of force onto the mechanism. Also, the cushions have already begun to indent from my use. I'd highly recommend spending another $50 and getting a better chair. You can read through a hundred reviews trying to decide whether this is the right chair for you.  Just understand one thing:  If you are an adult, this chair will NOT be even remotely supportive to sit for an extended time.  Full Stop.  If you are going to save money and buy this chair, just understand you will absolutely, positively need to buy a memory foam seat cushion.  There's no excuse in the universe for the seat in this chair to be so thin and unsupportive.  Add some padding and charge another $5-10, which is cheaper than buying a seat cushion. I bought this as a home office chair. I just had to purchase another because the seat cushion is entirely flattened. I can feel the solid metal when I sit in it now, and it started to become painful. If you're using it occasionally, go for it. It's comfortable, the seat is wide and deep.  But if you're going to be using it frequently and need it to last more than 6-12 months, I'd definitely pick a different chair. The chair is nice and I like it BUT I‚Äôm 5ft 1in and the chair is too short for me. Causes straining because I can‚Äôt lift the chair height based on it own maximum height settings. Too bad because it‚Äôs nice. Gotta return it Sturdy and comfortable Overall good looking chair, but they missed the mark on the assembly.One of the holes on the bottom where the base screws in will just spin freely so there is no way to screw in the bolt. Missing one of the screws to hold the back piece to the armrest. So it total, there are only 3 out of four screws holding it to the base, and one side only has 3 out of four screws holding the back to the armrest. This leaves for a very shakey cheap-feeling chair. It is pretty good. I would not use this for my primary desk chair. It would be great for a conference room or a chair that doesn't get sat in all day. It is better than the IKEA chair at a similar price point. The design looks nice but the comfort is horrible! This chair is the worst chair I have ever sat in can‚Äôt tell you how bad it is .If I didn‚Äôt get rid of the box I would send it back very very disappointed Foam of the base and back get flat in a month, and now it feels like sitting on a wooden board. Back has become so hard that I started having severe back pain The seat broke after 4 months. Having to return it was difficult. Don't buy it! When I was assembling this, I noticed that one of the screws at the bottom of the seat did not match. So, the chair is a little unstable when I sit on this... Bought this chair because I‚Äôm taking a lot of online classes and I knew I‚Äôd have to spend a lot of time sitting down. It was very easy to assemble and it only took a few minutes! It‚Äôs very sturdy and has been very helpful. Love this chair and would definitely recommend getting it. This chair lasted just over a year. It first started leaning within about 6 months and then the frame cracked just after the warranty ran out. If you need a chair that you'll use often don't buy this. Easy to put together. Light but sturdy. Looked durable. This chair was easy to assemble. Our previous chair was handsome but painful to sit in for any length of time. This chair is so good my husband remarked immediately on the improvement. Initially, he was not in agreement with me to order a new chair. I am glad I didn't get discouraged. Easy to assemble and looks great. Very comfortable too. Soft and confey Great chair just wish It was a little larger or that I was smaller lol. Not terrible for the price, mine stopped working after four years of moderate use. Probably worth investing more for my next purchase. Chair padding already flat didn‚Äôt really last a month Honestly, after opening the box and looking at all the parts ... I immediately returned all parts back to the box ü•∫I've never had the patience to assemble anything; Have always seeked out a Handyman.I wanted to use my chair asap and decided to attempt the task at hand.I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF And You Can too!Thanks Amazon ü•∞ Cant complain about this chair. I needed something affordable, comfortable, and fast as we had very little time to transition to working from home. This chair checks all of those boxes. I'm 5'5"" and 210lbs and I can comfortably do a 10 hour shift in this chair. Not sure how well someone taller than myself would handle it. Only small complaints are: no adjustable lumbar support (I roll a thin blanket and put it behind me) and the arms are pretty dang low.I like it though, not many issues in my opinion. Structural failure due to poor design and materials used.  Failed after 9 moths of use.  Obviously poor quality product. Easy to put together and it looks like a nice chair but the cushion wears out quickly- like in 2 weeks.  I'm remote; and it is so uncomfortable; but I've had now for about 5 weeks ....at it's awfully uncomfortable. The product description says this chair is covered in bonded leather. Not true. The chair is made with man-made materials. Chair made in China. What's new. Seems pretty comfortable.  The assembly is easy until you put the back in, then it becomes quite difficult.  Would suggest not tightening the handle screws until you get the back in place. Very uncomfortable, it broke within a year. Don't buy this chair. No back support. After 4 months will not stay up If your tired of using a folding chare look no further this will cup you a$s just right It's an OK chair, but given how many hours i'm  sitting in it a day maybe i should have spent for a nicer chair.  Padding and support are nothing special. This chair is not very comfortable at all and the back is super short. I was under the impression that the back of the seat would be taller. Will not be sending it back as I just dont want to be put through the hassle of dissembling it and trying to fit it back in the box. waste. of. money. Great quality & wonderful price Exactly what I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 130lbs and work a 9-5 from home, this chair comfortable and a good starter chair. It‚Äôs cozy, attractive and I find it easy to clean. I‚Äôve had it at least 1 month and haven‚Äôt had any issues with the ‚Äúleather‚Äù peeling yet. Probably will upgrade eventually to get neck support and more mobility, but all around great chair. Chair was exactly as advertised.  It looks good and is very comfortable. It was very easy to assemble. Wow! My room theme is white and black, so when I saw this chair I knew I had to have it. Supports great for the price and looks flawless! Easy to put together. This was easy to assemble and the hydraulic works good too but, it's not super comfortable. And the fact that it doesn't go all the way to the back, i didn't like it. It does the job hence the three stars. Easy to put together, yes, but again chairs are not difficult, absolutely awful chair, like sitting on a massive rock, save your money and buy a decent chair, problem with office chairs is once you have them together, you cannot get them apart (seat height post) and even if I did, trying to return something in this time, forget it.Unless they are going to send me a usable cushions This chair has a very firm supportive seat. Beware- I am 5'6"" and the back of my chair hits half way up my shoulder blade. I personally find it to be a great spot for support but taller folks... I JUST LEARN THAT FAUX LEATHER IS NOT FRENCH LETHER BUTERET...IS PLASTIC SO IF YOU WANT A LEATHER CHAIR THIS IS NOT THE ONE,,,BEWARE I was surprised at the level of cushion on this chair. It was very thin. I think this chair will be okay but not the best for sitting long periods of time which is really what I purchased it for. I guess you get what you pay for. Gift to my daughter Great Basic Office Chair. Easily assembled by myself alone. I'm not handy at all but I did this one all by myself. Leans forward and after awhile makes your ass feel like a pancake no padding whatsoever would not recommend I'm 185lbs and if leaning back on the cheat causes a catastrophic break then this thing was defective to begin with.Disappointing. We would have given this 5 stars the first month of purchase, but after a year it is the most uncomfortable chair and actually caused back pain. We should have known from the price. We purchased another chair known for ergonomics for quite a bit more but it is worth saving our backs! This is god looking and comfortable at first. Would only recommend for someone who site in it for less than an hour a day. Love this chair because of the height it adjusts to. I am short and my large wood desk is a little higher than my student desk so it allows me to rest my arms properly when on my laptop. Chair is very comfortable & wheels run very smoothly across hardwood floors The seat was fairly easy to put together, and the back feels quite comfortable, which is the main reason I bought a new chair (sitting on a chair with a painful back is a good reason for getting rid of it). The seat, though, is definitely NOT comfortable. I wish I had read a comment on this before I spent $100 on a new seat. I will definitely buying a cushion to make things better to sit at my desk. Great price, easy to assemble.Good luck Use this product at my home desk .Just not enough  in the seat,  you tend to sit in  a hole going downeard. This chair was purchased to replace a chair that was over 10 years old.  Old one was more comfortable than this one by far.  My only complaint is the seat padding.  Literally feels like sitting on a board with some thin cotton stuffing stapled to the top of it.  If your going to be spending a lot of time in the chair look elsewhere.  We bought a different brand for our other desk HUGE difference in the padding. Very comfortable chair. The arms are low and it isn't made for a large person. Product is not particularly comfortable and unfortunately came clearly used. This product is just terrible. It gets torn off after a couple of months. This chair was pretty easy to assemble. Nice chair. Wish the back of chair was higher There was too much plastic. Did not hold up to how much i use my desk chair. the chair is extremely uncomfortable the back feels like its about to break when you lean back there is almost no padding as soon as you sit you feel the board underneath not at all worth it spend the extra dont waste youre time im sending this back today I bought this chair back in August and it's already starting to fall apart after only moderate use. Would not recommend purchasing this chair, consider some other alternatives.Definitely would not purchase this product again myself. This chair broke less than a month of having it. Basic chair. Its not gonna rescue you from pre existing back pain or anything, but its fine. Little wide, and of course these cheaper chairs ""rocking"" function is laughable. Id say its only worth 50 bucks, but chairs are ALL overpriced so youre not gonna get your moneys worth from anything. Before I put it together inspect the material because at first glance was surprised was thiner than I thought  Big disappointment  I can‚Äôt speak to It‚Äôs comfortability because I highly recommend Not assembling it because I draw chairs With hydraulics I nearly impossible for me to disassemble. I returned it I was very glad I was refunded as promised ...How do you need to check my bank statement..I have to call customer service.. have to straighten up quite a few items told to keep throw away or donate rather than return and I would be reimbursed however the charge went through and I‚Äôd already given it away hope it works out ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's been 6 month and the chair is holding up well.  For a last minute purchase for a quick home office setup this has been a surprisingly a good little chair.  Set up was not too hard.  I did purchase a back support pillow to sit up straight, but that's because I do have back problems. I picked this one up for my son, who is a larger person at 6' and 205 pounds.Pros: - robust enough for larger people  - easy to assemble  - rolls smoothlyCons: - back not very high and a bit uncomfortable with longer useWith COVID and schooling from home, my son needed a desk chair. This one does the job for the price.  The chair is robust enough for his larger size, adjusts well to his height, and rolls smoothly. The seat itself is comfortable and doesn't irritate with longer sitting periods. The back, while not bad, isn't quite high enough for long lounging...which he shouldn't do anyway.If we were wanting a high-quality chair for hours of sitting pleasure, we would have purchased something more expensive. However, this does its job as school zig-zags between being in session and not. He's generally happy with it and so is my pocketbook. U need to have a personal drill machine to set it up, because the tool key to set this chair just broke.Not very supportive back but what can u do for 76 dollars It a beautiful chair easy to assemble however it's not what I expected.  I expect more comfort. Also the little knot on the sides kept popping off. I even lost one of them. This chair is flimsy. No matter how I adjust it, the back still leans backwards like a rocking chair making it impossible to sit up with good posture. Padding on the seat is basically non - existent after only a few months of low use. It also doesn't drop low enough. It gets the job done. It‚Äôs pretty comfortable. I just wish the handles were a little thinker and the back was just a little longer, but I‚Äôm short so the back doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. Now 4 years old and the ""leather""is peeling off this chair. The arms started 4-5 months ago. Contacted the manufacturer and they sent a new set of arms no charge. Now the rest of the chair is peeling, both seat and back. Will contact them again. great chair for price Nice chair for the price terrible quality, the fake leather will start to peel off in one year or so it lasted a month and then part of it feel apart on the screws.  just lasted long enough for amazon not to stand by it. Broke 2 months in from leaning back in it normally dont buy its a p.o.s. I bought this one for ~60$ which I felt was a good deal. Been using it all the time post COVID. I feel the cushion is giving away after using it regularly. Not worth the current 96$ IMO. It's just like any other chair. Amazon managed to make their own and price it down cheaper, compared to other same exact chairs with a logo on it. Only thing is one of the arms doesn't fully line up with the hole so i can place the plastic cover on it. Excelente Chair is not ergonomically constructed. Very uncomfortable and unsteady. I bought a similar amazon basics chair and it broke in 4 months. I bought this one as a replacement and it broke the first day. Unbelievable. I was excited to get a new desk chair but this thing is extremely uncomfortable. The plastic arm rests have sharp pieces of plastic that scratch my arms. There is no lumbar support as the lumbar cushion is actually recessed. Tiny chair that would be adequate for a child. I wish I never took it out of the box. i am not as picky as some other buyers. that said...put aside 1 hour to assemble. i find the chair to be comfortable. it's a $75 chair. i don't know what people expect from it. but as of this point, i am good with it and would recommend. i'll post an update in a month or so. also, my wife says it looks more black than brown. I had this chair  for a while and it is was very flimsy .  If you recline too far back it would start making cracking noises and act like it was going to fail. HORRIBLE Cheap Chair - Squeaks - Leans to One Side - Parts Falling Off - Worst Chair Ever! The arm rest is useless... didn't even last a year...this is a waste of money.. don't buy it. Well built and seems like good quality but sized for children or small adults. Back rest too low. This product took me 1 hour to setup. It was very difficult and the screws do not align perfectly. I caused some damage to the product during assembly because the screws are short and do not securely fit. Like many of us I had to improve my home office for covid19 remote work. My home office was not conducive to long-term comfortable work. My real office chair is apparently a gem and too expensive for me to buy for home - I actually contemplated going to office to bring my chair home.  This amazonbasics is decent, better than what I had but weak in regards to true ergonomic comfort. Easy to assemble. Not as Sturdy or firm as my real office chair that Iong for. And if you worked from home permanently this chair by amazonbascis would not be my choice - obviously that would required much more money I guess I had it coming when I purchased a $50 office chair but I expected at least some level of seat cushion. Plus, the ""brown"" office chair is so dark I initially thought they sent me a black model by mistake. I had to take it into sunlight to verify that it was at least brownish. I'm too lazy to disassemble this thing and send it back so I'll be buying a $30 memory foam seat cushion for my $50 office chair. You might want to avoid this product. Goes down slowly as you sit, not good for arthritis on the knees. Very easy to assemble. Soft leather. Truly enjoy the chair This chair came a day ahead of time and i am glad it did. Great chair and easy to assemble. Thanks. Terrible. I weigh 180 pounds and within an hour of sitting in the chair I can already feel the hard seat material under the pad. I know it‚Äôs cheap but good lord. Expected to get at least a year out of it. Thumbs down. Very easy to assemble, cheap chair but beats paying 300.00 for similar chair  at a popular office supply store that's currently going out of business nothing This chair is really comfortable. The wheels do work, the lever works, and the support is great! It had a few scratches and I purchased it new and the box was so damaged when it arrived. That is why I did not give the 5 stars. Other than that it is a great chair (for nails :D). I needed an office chair for my desk. I was expecting it to be a little bit larger than it actually is. It is comfortable but it is not very customizable. I was hoping that I would be able to lean the chair back more and make it move up and down more but it doesn‚Äôt do either very much. Also some of the hardware that came with the chair was unusuable and we had to make it work. Extremely uncomfortable, easy to put up. Don‚Äôt recommend buying though The chair is lightweight & Uncomfortable. I would not buy this chair again. I was using a metal folding chair and my buttocks was going numb. This is a dramatic improvement. It isn't the highest quality product (China), but it is an improvement. Now, we'll see how long they last with normal use and if the replacement cost to that duration is still a value investment over the better rated products."
7,"Amazon Basics Extra Thick Exercise Yoga Gym Floor Mat with Carrying Strap - 74 x 24 x .5 Inches, Black",Sports and Outdoors,"I have used this for both yoga and exercise. It stretches under the feet when trying to plant your legs for poses like warrior 2, which causes you to slip from a straight line position as the entire mat stretches lengthwise. Similarly, with plank exercises it stretches, causing instability and could potentially cause injury as your body is lengthening more than you may have anticipated. Nice, soft and thick pad. It‚Äôs a good long length and wide enough. Start falling apart after using 3 times I was looking for a yoga mat that was a little longer than the one I had.  This one is the perfect length.  It is also thick enough and is of good quality.  I hope it is durable as well.  Only time will tell. This mat is extra thick and has a smooth texture. I've been using it for outdoor yoga and don't feel any of the rocks or sticks that usually annoy me. The carrying strap keeps it rolled up when not in use, too. I bought it for my yoga class, my instructor said it was the wrong mat, it‚Äôs too thick, I‚Äôve used it 5 times, and the rubber is breaking apart. A waste of money. This mat stretches when you‚Äôre using it (picture doing a warrior II pose and one foot is sliding one way the other foot is sliding the other). It also rips so easily. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you actually practice yoga. Product fell apart within first use. Will be returning I thought it would be more comfortable  to use.  I am a senior citizen.  Not great when you have to use your elbows to get up.  Painful. Perfect mat, just wish it was a little wider and had a Velcro strap instead of the stretchy strap. The complaints about the smell are accurate, but this comes with the material and processing. You can clean it off and let it air out or just let it sit out and air out over time. Straps and handle did not come with mat as pictured Too soft. Was looking for an extra thick yoga mat thays the same density as a standard yoga mat. This one is too soft. I thought it would come with the carrying strap. Nice and comfortable and thick but mine didn't come with the strap to carry it. Bummer The mat itself is great, thick and comfy, easily cleaned and rolled. However, it did not come with the traps shown in pic, it was just wrapped in plastic. Pretty annoying to not get what is shown in pic. After a few weeks of usage, breakages begin to appear The mat arrived without carrying strap, Scotch-taped together instead. I am disappointed with this purchase. I really like the mat itself.  It's working great.  Unfortunately, the shoulder strap was never delivered. Used in my yoga practice. Too thick. Hard to stand and balance on it. Mat didn‚Äôt come with the carrying strap as it‚Äôs being advertised Waaaay to big... Did nit like the quality of the product I love the thickness of this mat however I feel like it doesn't have enough ventilation. It gets very sweaty very quickly and is ""hot"" to work on. The mat came without carrying strap. Mat itself is good but without the stray very difficult to walk around. I am returning it. Yoga"

9,"Avarelle Acne Pimple Patch (40 Count) Absorbing Hydrocolloid Spot Treatment with Tea Tree Oil, Calendula Oil and Cica, Certified Vegan, Cruelty Free (ORIGINAL / 40 COUNT)",Beauty and Personal Care,"I‚Äôm not all that impressed it don‚Äôt do anything from what I noticed pimple was the same as it was when it was applied. Patch was worn for the recommended 6+ hours An okay product with great customer service I ran out of my Welly brand patches and got these because it was coinvent but honestly they don't really do anything for me. I'll continue to use the Welly brand as those worked far better Eh can't say it was great or awful, didn't see much of a difference. Pimples didn't lessen really. Works well for me. I've used twice and each time it worked well. It's best if you use as soon as you see the acne appearing. Don't wait Like this product, they stay on and work. Will continue to buy them. Works very well, wish they also offered a bigger size. I love how clear they are and honestly I like using them because it keeps me from touching the zit, but the zit-deleting properties I was hoping for don't seem to do anything for me. I have sensitive skin and did not react to these. Bought these to try out especially since they‚Äôre easy on the wallet if you know what I mean. They‚Äôre not bad. Pretty good for the price. They are clear so you will see the pimple or redness underneath. One thing I noticed is that after the 6-10 hours of having them on you can tell it has sucked up the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù stuff and there are times it doesn‚Äôt come off the skin so you end up having to use another patch or just use a q-tip to squeeze it out so you don‚Äôt scar yourself. That‚Äôs it. Would I but again? Maybe, like I said they weren‚Äôt terrible but I might try another brand just to compare them and see. I tried the Nexcare patches, and was impressed with how will they worked, but, they were thick, fell off, and were hard to stick to my skin because they often folded over when I tried to pull them off the backing. I saw these for Prime day and decided to try them out. Oh MY Gosh!OK, first, the backing splits so that these are easy to pull off. They don't fold over. They stick to my skin soooo easily, but are easy to pull off. Actually, I have been able to reposition these if they didn't hit where I wanted. They are sooooo thin! When they are on my skin they are almost invisible. They soothe. Oh, I think that may be the best part. I get angry, big bumps, where the pimple is under the skin, and they itch and are hot from the skin stretching. These soothe that so that I can forget that I have pimple, and not feel the need to pick at it. They do help the puss up from regular pimples and white heads.These don't get rid of a pimple overnight for me, but they do shorten it. A pimple that would normally take over a week to clear up takes only 3 days. I don't have to worry about scarring since I am not picking at my face.Even those these are more expensive than the Nexcare ones, this is the brand I am going to stick with. It's like going from the base model to the luxury one. Tried it on several occasions daily and no improvement whatsoever.  Nice try, but doesn‚Äôt wirk. These patches had the worst adhesion out of any acne treatment patches I've ever tried. They never stayed on all night, and did not work for me personally. I wouldn't waste my money on this product again. It seems like it just dehydrates the pimple a bit but does not make puro redness disappear. Visible. Sometimes an edge won‚Äôt stick flat. As a first-time user, I am add glad I took the chance. This does just what it promises. These are interesting. They do cover the area and actually help with covering up a bad blemish. For me putting concealer on the dot versus the blemish I think really allowed the belong to clear a bit more quickly. I can‚Äôt say they helped with clearing them up quickly but they did seem to help reduce size and redness a bit. I‚Äôve been using this acne sticker brand for the past month and they work amazing. They are a little expensive for only getting 40 but the other brands that give you 180 or so don‚Äôt work nearly as well as these. I won‚Äôt use another brand any longer! The stickers drew so much from my pimple that was cystic & prevented me from picking and touch it. this works better than mighty patch for me. gets rid of any pimples within 1-2 days. the variety pack comes in multiple sizes too. clear and cannot see on skin. I have had on and off success with these; still not sure on their effectiveness. These work great but I was missing half of the patches. Only came with one sheet. Did absolutely nothing for me. Not as adhesive as another brand I use. I bought these in hopes of finding a cheaper alternative to Mighty Patch but these did literally nothing. I used multiple in the same spots for three nights in a row and nothing changed. Really disappointed. Will not buy again. I wore many acne patches before but these don‚Äôt seem to do much. They really dry out my acne and if you wear make up then you‚Äôll have a lot of dry patches on your skin. These are cheaper than the patches that Sephora sells ""Peace Out Salicylic Acid Acne Healing Dots 20 Acne Healing"" but do not work nearly as well. I would give these patches a D- and would recommend purchasing the Peace Out brand patches. Did not help Ok, these things are truly miracle-workers! A staple in my medicine cabinet! I get really big, cyst-y pimples that are super deep and painful a couple times a month. IF I can not pick at them, which is a struggle if I'm honest, I can get them to go away in about 3 days with these patches and some inexpensive acne cream. I go through the larger sizes pretty fast because the patch needs to be a good bit bigger than the pimple to stick really well. You'll absolutely see visible reduction in size and get tremendous pain relief over night. First, I put on a niacinamide gel, then, a benzoyl peroxide cream. Let that dry a few seconds. Put a patch on. Leave it overnight. And BOOM. Less. Pimple. Just repeat a few days till it's all gone! Would highly recommend! 10/10 Y‚Äôall, this stuff is MAGIC! I‚Äôm not lying, these things will literally suck the gunk out of your face over night!! I most definitely doubted these but man was I wrong! I use these religiously now, just bought my 2nd pack! It doesn't really work This is the first time I have written a review. These little stickers are almost comical. They do absolutely nothing than pick up some skin flakes. Save money and buy scotch tape. These are a lifesaver. In my 30s and still get a pimple here and there, these guys work a miracle overnight. I‚Äôve used the hero patches as well and these work better for me since they don‚Äôt dry me out as much and the price and quantity is better! These didn‚Äôt pull out as much gunk as other products I have used. I just received them a couple days ago. They adhere well to your face. They are not visibly obvious on your face from a distance even without makeup but close up it would be noticeable.I applied a few pimple patches and I'm not convinced yet. Perhaps my expectations were too high. But I have the whole pack to see if they really work. I‚Äôve been using these acne patch for a few months! I mostly have a clear skin most of the month but right before my menstrual cycle I get one or two pimples in spots that are in the worst spots on my face. These patches quickly speed up the process. I will put it overnight and I will wake up with a reduced pimple to nearly gone! I definitely recommend. I purchased these for my daughter. She didn‚Äôt like them. They didn‚Äôt work for her. They work very well, I wish they were a little bigger These do work. However if you have cystic acne I did notice that it will suck stuff out of the zit but not everything. Maybe my acne is just more stubborn that others. Don‚Äôt let that discourage you to try because we‚Äôre all different. For regular/less stubborn zits it works great because I am a PICKER! You will see the gunk on the sticker when you pull it off and whatever else is there you can mostly wipe away. On another note I will add if you have multiple zits everywhere like me the stickers went in a week. I‚Äôm going to try an actual patch& hopefully from this brand so that I can cover more area at once. I am an actual pizza faceüò≠ Did absolutely nothing. Tried on multiple types on blemishes and zero result. Patch doesn't fully conform to face. Seems to have no real effect other than preventing you from touching the spot. Wore them for more than 6 hours at a time and only change was less redness Easy to use I place one of these over the breakout and it goes to work!  It‚Äôs amazing how quickly the blemish disappears. By the next day there is much improvement. Made my acne so much worse in the long term. Would not recommend. I wasn't a believer lol but I used them and it does actually work, for some cases. There were larger pimples I had to use more than one patch until it actually got better, but it was worth it. I want to do it all the time now and have recommended to all of my friends and family. These appear to be designed for & most effective with traditional acne (""white head"" pimples), so I wasn't sure if there would be any benefit for the recurrent cystic acne that I struggle with (caused mostly by hormones and medications).So I tried these on two acne cysts that were pronounced in size, red, and likely getting larger (no 'white' head at all). My usual regimen includes a retinoid & benzoyl peroxide and these were resistant to responding, so typically the cysts are around for a few weeks until they go away.Anyway - put one patch on each cyst overnight. I did my usual face care routine at night, let dry for about 30 minutes, then put the patches on. I was very surprised that 1) they stayed on overnight, because I move around a lot when sleeping; and 2) I woke up to cysts that were much smaller, less inflamed/red, and much less painful.So based on reducing cystic inflammation alone, I'm very happy with these. I will try these once per day to see if they continue to work. I don't think these will 'fix' or get rid of the cysts but it feels so good to have less inflammation! These patches had a hard time staying stuck to my face.  Also, don't move or try to reposition once you have stuck in a spot. They stick less if you talk.  Good idea, probably wouldn't buy again. Easy to use, Great way to get rid of blemishes, helps to get rid of the redness and irritation as well Ok, I am disgusting because I love these! Put them on, go to bed, wake up, and your zit is gone with all the gross stuff stick to this little thang. I rarely break out so the patches last me well over a year. If you‚Äôre coming from using the hydrocolloid patches that have 4 big patches in a box and you‚Äôre hoping these will last you longer with the same effect, don‚Äôt waste your time. Now - they work 75% on bringing a zit to its white head but will not do allllllll of what the hydrocolloid patches do. Just get those instead I have used other brands and thought I would try these. Nothing like the past brand I had from target. Will not purchase these again as they didn't draw anything put and hurt to take off. Doesn't work very well-stickiness is so-so.They didn't bother my skin, but that's probably because they didn't stay on very long. Didn't work for me Helps suck out oils makes pimples smaller not disappear otherwise great i‚Äôm shocked at how well these work. i put them on before bed and by the time i wake up, the bump is muuuuch smaller. i have super sensitive skin and this hasn't irritated it at all I get PMS acne and combination skin. I do not get too oily though. I have tried these on a couple different size pimples and I cannot get them to stay on my skin. They just slide right off or I have to keep pressing them down to stay on. I do see some places where the patch turns white like it is soaking up the infection from the acne but it is so annoying they won‚Äôt stay on. I will not be buying this product again. These worked good for one of my teens and made the other one break out. If you have any sensitivity to adhesives I would advise not to buy these I‚Äôve never written a product review on Amazon but I‚Äôve never been more impressed with a product before! I was skeptical at first and didn‚Äôt really read the reviews before hand, I just saw that they were highly rated. They arrived quick and I instantly put 1or 2 on for the night to test them out. For a couple of weeks before this I had been breaking out so bad. It seemed like over night, my really bad pimples were just gone! In the morning the little patches had pulled so much gunk out of my face! In the couple weeks since this, my face has cleared up entirely! When I feel a zit start to come in I put a patch on and it is basically gone in a couple of hours! I‚Äôm the kind of person that once I feel a zit start to come in, I have to pick at it and it makes things so much worse, but these keep me from picking all together! I am amazed by how well they stick, I‚Äôve put them in the crease of my nose over night and I don‚Äôt worry about the moving or coming off! These are seriously the best purchase! I use these overnight and they work. I‚Äôve worn them during the day as well, in a pinch, they‚Äôre barely noticeable. I‚Äôm on auto delivery because they‚Äôre that good. Didn't really work as advertised. This product works, but not on cystic acne that has been there for awhile.  You need to apply it as soon as you feel the pimple under your skin. This was used in conjunction with acne pads and Zapzyt in the evening/overnight and these pads in the day.  They are very good at hiding the spot, where you can't see it Used it on acne in different areas.  It did not work at all.  I also found the same product at our local Dollar Tree. I don‚Äôt have major skin problems, but every so often I have a need for these. The patch really does work! It blends with my skin and adhere so well that I‚Äôve forgotten I had it on. Yet, it remove easily when you peel it off.I have tried two other brands and am purchasing this brand again. Love sticking them on, and then heading to bed, then in the morning its fun to take them off and see what it took out! They work amazingly! These don‚Äôt work. Also it‚Äôs not an overnight fix, the package states you may have to repeat treatment. I followed directions and they just don‚Äôt work. These patches stuck on well, we‚Äôre basically translucent so they cover up pimples discreetly, and also were easy to remove. However, they did not do anything to get rid of my pimples (just a minor breakout of whiteheads). I like these because they don‚Äôt make any big zits worse. It does make my skin pretty dry though? I just have sensitive skin maybe.... I will continue to use them ! I can not say enough amazing things about these little miracle workers. If you are like me and have a tendency to pick and push and cause discoloration then you definitely need these! It dries the entire blemish out while you're sleeping and saves you from the endless picking and prodding that will eventually cause those lovely scars we all hate It‚Äôs okay, it works okay. I like clearasil acne patches better The product worked to cover the zit but minimal absorption Got these for mask-ne. I‚Äôve been using them a bit and have come to the observation that while these don‚Äôt seem to suck dry a whitehead, they do have a very valuable function: if you put this on, it won‚Äôt get worse. So if you are putting it on a popped/scrubbed lesion it will heal very well and you won‚Äôt wake up to a monster on your face. I consider that quite helpful so thumbs up. I‚Äôm someone who struggles with sensitive skin and outbreaks. So I was happy to see it worked well on my skin. You have to use them a couple of times on the same spot to see noticeable difference but I feel like that‚Äôs to be expected. There‚Äôs not miracle cure for acne. I was overall very happy with the entire experience and would buy this again! I will say however, if you‚Äôre someone who struggles acne patches and rosacea, it might be better to get the larger patches as these are perfect for single pimples. I would still recommend them to others though. This item does not work as it says it will and the patches do not always stay on. I'm not sure if this works, but it sticks to skin well. I tried it out because I was getting small pimples from my mask and it kind of goes down, but nothing remarkable. It is easy to just put on and take off though."
10,"BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",Electronics,"It‚Äôs pretty good when you are in the game and need to listen to your teammates talking, but when it come to REALLY needing a good ear, its, ‚ÄúNoise Cancellation‚Äù feature comes a bit short. It does dampen the noises outside fairly well, but not enough for certain games that need an attentive ear.But otherwise, if you were to use this for gaming, it‚Äôs pretty darn good for multiplayer, and also really good for single player games. They work great. My 12 yr old has used them for 6 months with no problem of cutting out or static but cloth ear pieces did fall off. the volume wheel seems to be the cause of sound cutting out partially, you have to jiggle it around a bit to get back to 100%  quality after adjusting volume with it.the mute switch is.. fake.. sounds that are loud enough or close enough to the mic, even coming from the headphones themselves, will still be heard when it's ""muted"".otherwise they are about as good as can be expected, durable and wearable comfortably even if you're a big skull, although the ear-holes can get a bit humid with extended use. good sound quality besides the problems with the in-line controls. Tried to use this on a work call with my laptop and on xbox for game session. No one could hear me, the mic has very low sound pick up. Also the microphone sits differently to the picture, the picture makes it look close to the face/mouth but when pulled into position you can not get it close to the side of your face let alone level with your mouth for sound.The positive is that the lights are nice and they are comfortable on the ears. I would give this headset 5 stars but the right headphone does not work properly. You have to adjust the volume switch just perfect to get the right-side headphone to work and any slight movement of the volume knob turns off the right-side headphone. It's clearly a connection issue but I bought the headset like 5 months ago and can't exchange it. They are very comfortable and if they worked properly, would easily get 5 stars and my recommendation. I got these for my step daughter she really likes them a lot they are very comfortable and she says she's been able to wear them for up to 2-3hrs with no issues A++ These work great for gaming.  I  can easily tell what direction sounds are coming from in CoD and Apex Legends.  For first person shooter games these work great and are very comfortable. The headset is really nice but the cord is like 3-4 feet so its constantly getting stuck or tangled mic broke after a few months and i know its these headphones because every other headset ive used worked The headphones seem to be well-made and the sound quality is great.  These were bought with the thought that they would be good for working at home but my customers keep saying they can‚Äôt hear me.  I would imagine it would be just fine for gaming. Sound lags from time to time External leds do not light up on my headset. Had this head set for 3 months and the sound started cutting out really bad on it Got these as an intended upgrade for a previous 15$ headset I got from Walmart. I wasn't expecting much, but I wish I had kept the Walmart headset now that I've tested these. They work just fine for video playback, no real complaints there. My main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how crummy the microphone is. The store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice, but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my laptop and this microphone, my laptop consistently provides louder, clearer results compared to this headset. There was still quite noticeable background noise in the headset's recording as well. There's also some design flaws with how the microphone is implemented; it is a completely rigid peice of plastic that only rotates vertically, so it just ends up hanging a good 5 to 6 inches from your mouth when deployed (yes, I got out a ruler and measured. It's that off). This is compared to other headset mics which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer, and in front of your mouth instead of beside it.The cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw. Simply put, the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of a cheap toy. The case on the connecting band is a bit better, being made from matte plastic, but not by much. The only things on this device that don't feel like they were slapped together for as low a material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord, which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the 3.5mm audio jack and the usb that powers the contractually obligated ""Gamer"" lights. I'd have honestly forgone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing, and a microphone that's actually somewhat flexible so I can actually hear myself speak.Overall:-Average playback quality. Nothing that would impress an audiophile, but nowhere near terrible. It's painfully average (and unfortunately that's more than can be said for the rest of the device).-Bad microphone design and quality. Just... don't bother. I got better results from the built in microphone array in my Thinkpad w530 from 2012 than I did with this thing.-El cheapo feel. Like a toy from a dollar store.Verdict:If you care about quality in your headset?Don't buy this. They sell this thing for 50$ at regular price. I got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount. Even still, I somewhat regret spending money on this thing, and I'd be leagues more disappointed had I paid the full asking price for it. It's barely worth it's weight at 25ish dollars, and there's no way it's worth the normal 50.If you just want something for discreet audio playback?Go find a better headset, or just settle for some earbuds. There's plenty of decent options for the latter under 20$ both in retail stores and online. This one isn't worth your time or your money. The only reason I'm even keeping this is because returning products has always been a pain in my experience, and because the headset itself technically works. But that's it. It's not even worth the hassle of chasing down a refund. This is the 3rd set I've had to purchase for my son in the last year.  We kept buying the cheap headsets and they would all last a couple months before the mic would quit working or the audio quality became really bad.  Finally broke down and bought him a nicer more expensive set and so far they are amazing at the quality and tech that is in those things. These are pretty good if you aren‚Äôt looking for long term. they work great but mine only lasted a few months before just completely giving out randomly It's nice and fits nicely the only thing I wish was better was how long the USB cable was to power the lights on it The noise cancelling is good and it's overall a comfortable headset (Xbox One), but the sounds cuts in and out and you have to keep moving the wire around. So it's not great for gaming with those issues. They worked great!! When they connected. :( Worth the money just doensnt. Light up Very cheap plastic and horrible mic. Not usable. Returning. Sound quality really bad, could barely hear the game with max volume on the headset. My son uses it for gaming and listening to videos while he does his school work on a laptop. Great quality will by more for my nieces and nephews. Really like it, comfortable and not too heavy. Didn‚Äôt cost much either The sound quality is fine. The mic quality is okay. But, the mic only works with my AirMac and not on my Windows PC. A bit disappointing. I've had these for quite some time now and they've stood up against use by myself (in my 30s), a 13 year old, and 7 year old. My only problem is that they do not work on my PS4. However they work fine for my Xbox One with no need to buy anything extra. I'm not sure exactly what I'm missing for them to not be working. Other than that, which is disappointing considering I wanted one pair for all my systems, they work nicely for the price and look good. 2 minutes in game and I'm already impressed.lightweight, comfortable and 3d surround sound.i bought these to use for my PS4 and when you swing a melee weapon you can literally hear it move from one side of the screen to the other. Good value for the money. Sound quality is Ok.  Cord seems ridiculously long but perhaps it‚Äôs because it works on the PC too (using for Xbox). Comfortable to wear.  Kind of big in size so if it‚Äôs for a kid just know it may be enormous on them. Would have liked better sound quality. Didn‚Äôt work in my gaming chaa du air , which was a big letdown. Recorded different ones. much better Oerfect for my 12yr old. They have held up unlike another brand purchased in a store.He has used everyday since the purchase!Used with his PS4 Connection was hard to get clearCan‚Äôt hear. As much as I want to give more stars for this product, the fact that it is way too heavy on my head and gives me headaches is too big of an issue. If the weight of the headset doesn't bother you, then definitely this is a solid product. But I've never felt so much weight from a headset. It's kind of concerning that this is also a gaming headset because the amount of time people will use it for gaming, it can probably cause pain to your neck/back in the long run. I would suggest looking for other products, even if this product has a lot of good reviews. I don't think anyone should be having this much weight on their head, even if it doesn't bother them. Sound is ok, lights are cool, mic isn't very good.  I wouldn't purchase again. I been cheap with my headsets but I been looking for one to replace one that I broke and paid a lot of money for, this one is really good if you play COD loek me its important to hear where the footsteps and coming from well here you go this is the best headset you will get for the reasonable price Cool colors. Lights up. Good sound quality The sound was good that came from the headphones. But the microphone you had to talk directly into it, and couldn‚Äôt have the headset on. Great headset if you are starting out as a streamer or trying to save on some money. It cancels out a lot of noise. It's comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. I would recommend this. It has a nice bass and super loud. You can adjust the volume. Pretty strong i luv the mic but volume should be able to turn alil more than u allow to also the cord is long enough & they are comfortable around my ears Really nice headset sounds good and all. The cable is extremely long. Came all twisted up and the sound would cut if I tried to untangle it . So had to return it . :( This headset has blown me away by how good it is. Very good quality. If you are looking for just a basic do the job type of headset this is it. it's very small.I really enjoyed the sleek design of it.But I think I'll have to give this to my kid.Yeah the padding is soft but very firm. Maybe my ears are too big? Cause it hurts to wear after a long period of time (max 3 hours)The microphone isn't great for what I wanted. I'm just too soft spoken of a person for this to work for me. Probably cause the mic is stiff and I can't get it any closer to my face. This purchase was a learning experience for me. My child loves this headset It‚Äôs a decent headset for a kid. The noise cancelling is nice but the volume doesn‚Äôt go very loud and when it‚Äôs all the way up there is a constant buzzing in the background. I gave it to my teen not worth the effort to return but don‚Äôt recommend it. Also lights only turn on if you plug it into a USB port. I liked everything about these until the microphone stopped working after only about a month or so. It was clear to hear but speaking for me, no one could hear me enough. The only time u cant hear anything is when u have it on full volume Horrible! Not the greatest We went on a long vacation so I worked part of the time, having meetings in the car. The people on the other end were able to hear me and not background noise from the road (even in torrential rain!).  I was also able to hear them clearly. It was exactly what I'd hoped for! Pretty good sound and audio quality for the price. Fits well and can wear for long periods of time. Good product for the price! Best gaming headset for an affordable price! I was blown away, they are great The sound quality was good but it barely picked up my voice and always had a constant ringing noise whenever I plugged it in Some reviews says these headphones are better than $100+ ones. No. They are not. I have Sony Studio Monitor MDR-7506 to compare with.Specs shows 15 Hz to 20 kHz. Not even close to 20 kHz. Sound like from metal barrel - without high frequencies and with over-boosted bass.Can not turn off LED light. There is a thing like a button on sound control box. I thought it should be LED switch button. It is not a button at all. Yes i would They aren‚Äôt noise cancellation and have a very loose fit on my ears. Also the sound quality is pretty bad and delayedThey‚Äôre decent starter headphones though. After playing with it for a day, it gets static really bad and lags. Originally gave 5 stars because they basically pay you for good reviews. Cheaply made...absolutely junk. Definitely would not recommend. Stopped working after second use. No sound...no power..nothing returned to seller for full refund. They worked well for a while. Lately have been causing feedback to the mic, which ofc makes them unusable. Not really sure what might have caused this issue all of a sudden. Whether it‚Äôs zoom meetings or gaming, I‚Äôm being told that when I speak there is an feedback loop. Upgrading to something better I guess.... Use these everyday. Considering another set to gift. The first headset I received was busted the sound barely worked in only one ear piece. So, I sent it back in for a new one. The return/receiving for the new headset was easy and quick.Now the bad part: The headset is lower quality than the description let on. I felt that the headset sound wasn't the worst, definitely a step up from an earbud headset. The mic, however, doesn't past any quality test of mine. I have always had an easy time of speaking to my team/friends but after getting this they could barely hear me. They described it as if I were across the room trying to speak into the mic (I obviously wasn't). I was disappointed with my purchase. Definitely going to purchase a new headset from a more reputable company. Decent headset I order the pink set of the gaming set super excited to get when I plugged it didn‚Äôt work cheap quality for 40+ dollars it‚Äôs plastic made. I really wanted to love this headset. It looks nice, and is very lightweight, but no matter what I did, they sound quality was incredibly poor. I wanted to be able to chat with friends online while gaming, and even with my output volume all the way up, and friends turning me all the way up in their settings, they could barely hear me. I could barely hear them, or any of the sound coming from my PC. I ended up replacing them within a week of purchase. they are fantastic My son loves them he says and it's much quieter now also for me n my wifeüò¥üò¥üò¥ The mic quality is ok it‚Äôs not the best, and the sound quality is pretty good! They looked cool and the comfort was not bad - But no matter how much I adjusted settings and played with them, people had a hard time hearing me over mic. Got annoyed and gave them away as I did not want to go through the hassle of returning them. Product defective static and not functioning properly. Would need to return it. So far so good! I am going to have to return the item due to the microphone not working correctly I'm not much of a gamer but I got these for work conference calls because my computer's mic is terrible. The first thing I noticed is that they felt like they were made with cheap plastic. The ear cushions are super stiff and they don't seem to get worn-in after using them. Even though I don't game too much, I still have some multi-hour sessions on GTA 5 at night and use these so I dont wake up my house. The sound is good but the ear cushions really start hurting my ears after prolonged usage. If you're looking for comfort, go elsewhere.The overall sound is good, not great. Absolutely no noise cancelling functions. Ordered this and received on 8/26.  While the audio quality wasn't ""high end"" by any stretch, husband was happy with the way these felt and sounded in terms of my usage. He used them for gaming and online chat, but the microphone on/off switch has broken after 5 days of use, rendering this headset completely useless for its intended purpose.  My husband has resorted to taping and gluing up the headset which was broken and ""unwearable"" because that headset still works.  This one, not so much. Functional headphones but it looks really cheap. The USB plug in is not long enough to connect to the PlayStation. The cord is so long but splits into two six inch cords. One goes into the PlayStation the other goes into the controller what the hell are you supposed to do My old headset was going out so I had to buy a new one. Saw this in the Amazon's choice on sale for over half off and the reviews were good so I bought it. Came in a day sooner than expected. They have great sound, came in at full volume and I had to lower the volume since it was so loud. I don't use the mic because I have a standalone mic, so I can't say how that works. My only complaint is the ear cushions aren't as comfortable as I hoped, they're kind of stiff. Yeahhhhh. Well, I think that the five star ratings are fudged. These are just okay. They are nothing special.Its just okay. Sound is okay. Quality is what your would expect from a price point.Its just okay if your not expecting much more than just a pair of headphones with lights on them. They look cool at first glance.  But one plugged in the sound quality was alright on the left side. Barely audible on the right side. The mic seems to be decent though I will say that. For the price, you absolutely can‚Äôt beat these! The brand name was a very odd twist on a more notable brand, but very solid product! My son absolutely loves it. I have been amazed by how great they are. Great sound. Loved this headset until 3weeks in, the mic quit working. For the price, these are amazing and the best headphones for the price. If you‚Äôre casually gaming and or have neighbors that don‚Äôt like hearing noises, this is the headset for you. If you‚Äôre competing online and need to communicate clearly with your teammates, I do not recommend this headset for you because the audio is not crystal clear from the built-in microphone. The only things I can really say that I don't like are the ears are a little smaller than most sets I've worn before and the cord has two plugs hanging from it instead of having an adapter to use on one plug Did not last long and we sent back. They broke. These headphones are super cheap and the material made with it breaks easily! I bought 2 of these, different colors and each one of them broke within the first 10 days of having it. Save yourself the time and money, buy better headsets from Walmart! They have quality items (if they don't u can easily return it) The game itself does not come through well but the other players do.  They are k but Iwill not buy again. The headset was great until the aux cord that connects to the control went bad now it won‚Äôt work I even purchased new controllers.  They went dead after 2-3 weeks. The sound quality is great.  Mic tested fine.The quality of the materials seems a bit cheap though.  The cushion for the top of the head, was a bit minimal.  The ear muffs, were a bit small, and did not really provide sufficient room for your ears to be comfortably inside them.  My ears were aching/hurting within 2 hours of wearing the headphones.If you're a kid, these will probably work out great for you.  An adult?  pass 'em up. Love the color and sound quality For The Price It's Not A Bad Headset. Sound Quality Is Good, Could Use A Sound Booster, Like A Button To Increase The Bass Or Treble. That's Just My Opinion After Using Multiple Headsets That Comes With Those Features. Overall, They Are Right In The Middle As Far As Sound And Price Is Concerned. Also, The Cord Is Alil Long, Like 3 Foot Long. Wish It Was Shorter. There Is Also Two Connects At The End. It's Split With The Headphone Jack And A USB At The End Of The Cord. Not Really A Big Thing, But It Does Get In The Way Sometimes. For the price this is working great. I‚Äôm stepping down from a set Bose QC headphones from 2010ish and I was worried the change would be really rough. The only complaint I have is the padding doesn‚Äôt go around my ears fully, so after about 30 min or so I need to adjust them because my ears hurt. Over all happy with the purchase Sounds good, nice fit on my head liked everything about this headset.  Great sound. It was a great present for a friend of mine because while gaming he couldn't talk because his old expensive headset broke fast. So far it's been a few months and this still works for him. He sounds better and the quality is also good. I'm not sure how noise cancelation is going for him though."
11,"Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping - Queen Size, Set of 2 - Cooling, Luxury Gel Pillow for Back, Stomach or Side Sleepers",Home and Kitchen,"They started out big and fluffy. I have been using them for months now and they are just average pillows, definitely still comfortable but a little flatter. I like writing reviews only when I really need or enjoy the product. This title says ‚Äúfor stomach sleepers‚Äù FALSE! Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the pillows are GREAT but for only side/back sleepers. I would keep them if I was not sleeping on my stomach 90% of the time bc when I wake up in the mornings.. my back hurts bc they are too fluffy. Otherwise they are bomb pillows. Hope this helps! Love it and resting peacefully. Thank you. Its not been long enough for a real quality gauge but they're super fluffy once they open up. So far, so good. The pillows are very comfortable and seem to have helped my sore neck; however, I can't say that the gel is very cooling. I wish they came with pillow cases because king size is too big and standard fits too snug and compromises the quality of the pillow.I love the pillow size and fullness. Cheap, flat, lumpy and uncomfortable. Very full but soft and moldable. Good night's sleep. If you are looking for a pillow with support don't buy.Spent all night fluffing to get a spot to lay my head. As advertised I really like the product and I recommend it. Game changer! Bought other expensive brand pillows and they were flat within a month. These are still firm and comfortable. My husband very particular about his pillow.This is first time he has actually said his pillows were comfortable.  I was skeptical when they came in box all rolled up. But all you have to do is shake them out to fluff and they are fine. Not as fluffy as expected We love the pillows but when it's time to wash you may as well throw them away. The water doesn't spin out and then they are to heavy to put in the dryer. It says tumble dry but unless you have an industrial size dryer  it won't work. Other than that they are very comfortable pillows. No more wrestling with my pillow all night. Better night of sleep! Love these pillows.  This is the second time ordering in three years.  Will order again. I'm not sure what all the hype is about. These pillows are not any better than what you can buy at Wal-Mart for about half the price. They are not hotel quality - at least not the quality one would find in a Westin or better. I'm really disappointed with these pillows as I have slept on much better pillows. But, considering that they cost about $15 per pillow - you get what you pay for.Anyhow, these pillows are soft - ridiculously soft. They do fluff up nice buy once you put your head on one of these pillows, it will sink almost to the mattress with basically no support.I didn't find these pillows cooling either. At least not as cooling as my existing pillows. What pillows are people comparing these pillows with?So, maybe I got took. After all, it was clear that these pillows weren't brand new because they weren't shrink wrapped. In fact, the box came distorted from the pressure exerted from the pillows being forced back into it. Even the tape job was obviously a repack. But, the tags clearly claim they were 'Beckham Hotel Collection' and they looked of new condition. So, I thought I'd give them a try. It's no wonder why someone would return these as I probably will too. And, I apologize in advance to whomever receives these pillow next. Seriously disappointed in these pillows. The are very lumpy and not supportive.  I feel as though I am laying directly on my mattress without a pillow. Did not expect form to come out of the pillow. They don't seem to be cooling or gel. If anything, they feel more down filled. They're comfortable but a little too flat in my opinion. And I just can't tell how or where the cooling effect takes place. I‚Äôve only had this for a couple of nights. It‚Äôs really hard to give it an honest opinion so early. However I have noticed it‚Äôs not as supportive for my neck as I need. First thing is the minute I fall asleep my üÜï normal 8 pound head turns into a 2000 pound concrete block, I flatten pillows, quickly, I would go through a normal pillow every few weeks, a foam pillow lasted but I didn't find it comfortable, it was too hard, then I ordered these pillows and to make it last I would only use one at a time, I took it out of the package and like the instructions said I let it fluff up for 24 hours, not good enough but I put it in my dryer and it became cloud like. I so expected to dislike this pillow, yes I did flatten it but not as much and it was easy to fluff it back up, after a few months I put it back in my dryer and it like new, 8 months later and I'm still using it. This pillow was a good buy. These pillows are great but only if you get the right ones.I was able to borrow one of these from my sister to test it out before buying and it was amazing so I ordered my own. I was so excited when they arrived but despite given them time to fluff up and shaking them out and doing everything I could think of they weren‚Äôt nearly as full and supportive as my sister‚Äôs. I checked product numbers of hers to mine to compare and they were the exact same just not as full. I talked to customer service and they said I was in the return window so do a return with Amazon, I ended up doing an exchange because I *really* wanted the good pillows that I knew were possible. The second set was so much better! If they were the ones I had gotten first this would have been five stars.So, long story short, these are potentially great pillows but you might have to exchange to find the actual good ones. I'm always hesitant to buy pillows because I like them firm, but after a few weeks *poof* they're flatter than a pancake. I was even more hesitant to buy pillows online but 'what the heck' I thought, why not?These pillows are ah-may-zing! Soft, yet firm. Supportive, but hug your head like fluffy angel wings. Lush, yet also not so thick your neck is elevated at a weird angel where you can't turn your head the next morning and you have to pivot at the hips when driving your car to see if anyone is coming before you can take a turn.These pillows make no sense, and I freaking love them! You will not be disappointed with this purchase. I purchased this because of the reviews and I thought ok they are hotel brand pillows they must be good! I am not saying they are bad but I was expecting something better! The price is really good but it is not the best pillow it is softer than I was expecting and kind of feels that my head is falling in the pillow making a hole‚Ä¶ Some may like it but for me I am still looking for something better! This pillow disperses heat and (mostly) I sleep more cool! The pillow has lots of little foam pieces, so it can be shaped for many sleep styles. It's a big improvement for me, and a big win! Super soft, yet easily adjust to head and neck. Great Quality! Nice pillow for the price.  Good support. These pillows sleep amazingly cool.  I will be buying more to replace all of the down bed pillows in my home! Sadly, from the reviews, I thought I'd get a firm pillow.....it isn't at all Product is white and lightweight. That's the good stuff. Having slept on these for nearly 2 weeks now, I wake in the middle of the night with my head sweating, having to bunch both of them together to get enough support while sleeping on my side and have a regular stiff neck each morning. I would certainly not buy these if you're looking for support or cool sleeping. Perfect size. Nice and fluffy. No more waking up from night sweats. I‚Äôm staying nice and dry. No more turning pillow over and over for a cool spot. Very happy with pillow and pricing. Have not washed and dried yet. I don't know what hotel has these pillows but i would recommend you stay away.I bought the two king size pillows to replace the old my pillow pillows that i havehad for about ten years. I am glad i did not throw them away because they are stillbetter than these pillows. i have used them for three nights so far and my neck iskilling me, Little to no support. I am not sure i can even return them No support for the head and neck Pillow needs more filling and firmness!!! First pillow in about 5 years  were I am getting a full night sleep.  Tried all kinds of pillows. This is one, that so far giving me no waking up and adjusting, fluffing, or punching to get back to a pillow Reordered these pillows.  I have two from last year, and they are outstanding.  Ordered two sets this time.  The new pillows are too soft and have no support.  After reading a lot of the other reviews, I have concluded that the quality may be ""hit and miss"" with this brand.  I am very disappointed because I loved the set of pillows that I ordered last year.  I gave it one star because I cannot use these pillows. So comfy!! They really do feel like hotel pillows! It was way to stuffed and puffy of a pillow and made it uncomortable. It hurt my neck and I don‚Äôt use them. I could see some people liking it if the like over stuffed pillows. They were very soft though. They get flat immediately I have gone through so many pillows in my lifeand for once I finally found THE ONE!! My husband has hated every pillow that I have purchased in the store and he absolutely loves these. I have never purchased pillows online so I took a chance and decided to buy this set that has so many wonderful reviews. And I‚Äôm so happy I did!! These pillows are perfect; not too soft and not too firm. They were packaged in an airtight bag. No mold, no smell, no bugs. I will definitely buy these again if the need arises. BUY THEM, YOU WON‚ÄôT BE DISAPPOINTED!! Pillow very fluffy, soft, and well made.Happy with my purchase. Nice I ordered this pillow because I searched ""best pillows"" and this came up. I was so excited for it to arrive, but upon unpackaging, it was lumpy and flat. I gave it all day to fluff up before sleeping on it, but I was sorely disappointed to find that my head just sunk into it. No support. I tossed and turned, fluffing and adjusting all night. I've slept on it a few nights now, and wake up with a sore neck. I feel I'd be more comfortable sleeping on a balled up sweater. This is the worst pillow. I am sad that I've wasted my money because now I have to buy pillows again. I cannot sleep on this another night. I do not recommend this pillow to anyone, especially if you have a head and neck. And you want to sleep. Terrible pillows. Worth 0.50 cents. I like these pillows however, one seems a little more firm than the other. These are not firm pillows, they are more fluffy but they don't seem to be losing their shape or have the filling bunch up so I would recommend. I took one star because the two pillows are slightly different feeling. These belong in a cheap motel very uncomfortable. Great pillows for anyone, would buy again Very comfortable pillow for side sleepers They are ok . Not as comfy as my Royal Velvet pillows from JcPenney.. wish they still made them :( Very soft. Loose fill. Sorry guests, they are going on the spare beds. These are well above average for the price for support and comfort. We purchased a two pack and one was perfect and the other was flat out of the box. Not enough support not comfortable These pillows came vacuum packed and I did not hold out much hope once I saw them. Then I opened the package, watch them inflate and sunk my head into their fluffiness. I have slept soundly every night and zero neck pain. I would highly recommend. Horrible, super flat Excellent quality at a fair price. Loved the queen sized version, so I bought King sized ones when I upgraded to a bigger bed. The King didn‚Äôt have the same amount of fill and was way flatter and less fluffy than the queen. I was so disappointed after loving the queen sized ones for so many years. I thought this would be a really comfy pillow like I had used at a hotel that I recently visited.  It is OK, more like a feather pillow, without the feathers.  I will continue my search and maybe go back to the hotel and read the tag if possible to find out what the pillow actually was. I was disappointed with these pillows. I bought them because I spent the night at a friend‚Äôs house fell in love with her pillows. She sent me the link for these pillows and even though they were on the pricier side I decided to buy them because I knew I liked them.Well once I got them out of the box, I realized these pillows were completely different quality than the ones she purchased many months ago from this same seller. These pillows do not offer anywhere near as much support. If these pillows costed $20 I would have left more stars but for over $40 I expect to get a good quality pillow. Pleasantly surprised by these gems Pros: good for side sleeping, back sleeping, stomach sleepingdon't get noticeably hotCons: can get a little flat, but you just have to flop the pillow or fluff it Unfortunately I found my pillow flattening throughout the night and I need to fluff them again. Started feeling neck pain due to the lack of support they provide. I‚Äôll be going back to my memory foam pillow. Love these pillows.  They are definitely hotel quality and worth the cost. I love these pillows! Comfortable and good rest over night I don‚Äôt know if I got the wrong pillow or what? But when I lay down my pillow went flat and my head was resting on the mattress. Came shrink wrapped and box to small to return. These have the support of a washcloth. Not sure how they quantify as ‚Äúluxury?‚Äù Should have taken a pic. 2 pack of supposedly highly rated pillows were jammed into a small box that was bulging & taped up. Supposed to be dog bone shaped per online photo specifically for those who toss & turn on back & side to side. Ones that arrived were standard rectangles. Totally heavy hard lumps like marshmallows that had been squished & turned into solid goo.  Did not expand like some mattresses or futons do. Just heavy blobs. Probably bad to start with but made worse by warehouse packing into way too small of a box. Pillows should never be squashed to mail. The opposite of some items we've bought from Amazon that are put in very unnecessarily too large boxes & filled with lots of those air packs - for things that aren't fragile or breakable. These are much more confortable than I expected! It was good for a week, later started to be thinner and lost it‚Äôs durability Pillows are highly individual- these are great for me. I‚Äôm a side sleeper. Good support with out being too firm. Keeps shape These are listed as gel cooling, that is not correct.  They may have foam inside but it has no cooling properties.  If these are supposed to work like the gel cooling pillows that are actually cool to the touch and remain that way all night, they are failures.  I think it‚Äôs more accurate to say these offer no cooling benefits and that description should be revised.As a regular pillow it‚Äôs fine, a bit squishy and feels like a down alternative. Was sold on the thousands of positive reviews & such great price. Arrived vacuum sealed in a roll, no mold.  Also got great reviews on Airbnb site‚Ä¶as these were for vacation house.Was not impressed.  It‚Äôs been about a week now.  Waking up with sore neck, sore shoulder and sore upper back. Used as side, back and stomach‚Ä¶.could not get comfortable in any position. I just found them overall too ‚Äòfluffy‚Äô‚Ä¶which I seem to be in minority.Was bummed b/c I was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt have to again purchase $200 pillow again‚Ä¶..but you get what you pay for. These will be good for decor pillows tho. These feel almost like feather pillows. They're soft and squishy but not at all cooling. I really wanted the cooling aspect and these don't have it. In fact, I feel like they sleep a little hot.  They're comfortable if you like a soft pillow. Quality seems decent but they're not very supportive unless you wad it up. Ordered these pillows the first time last fall they were amazing and wonderful ordered them a few weeks ago like half the stuffing is missing very poor quality severely disappointed because the first set was amazing quality and comfort were great I keep over sleeping for work because of these pillows, there wonderful! The pillows are excellent quality, feeling and rest inspiring! I ordered myself a set first and had to buy my young adult going to college! It is my favorite pillow! Highly recommend! My husband and I were talking about how hotel pillows always seem so comfortable.  This one feels just like they do in the hotels but after a few nights, my neck was hurting.  My husband loves it but I have just struggled finding the perfect pillow.  This one is squishy just as I‚Äôd hoped but my neck has been achy.  I have spent 100‚Äôs of dollars at this point looking for the perfect pillow but just haven‚Äôt found it yet.  I know pillows and mattresses are particular to each person, hence the 5 stars on the product rating.  It‚Äôs exactly as I expected as far as the product I was ordering, just still not my perfect fit. Unfortunately, I threw out all the wrappings or I would've returned them right away.  These pillows feel lumpy and I have a hard time sleeping with them.  My neck ended up being stiff in the morning.  Not worth it. I love these pillows! I didn‚Äôt want a pillow too fluffy or too flat. I have trouble sleeping at night, and now I‚Äôm getting hot flashes, so I need comfortable and cool pillows. These do the job. I even bought 2 more to go in my guest room, and I had guests this past weekend who liked them too. If you‚Äôre like me, you hate spending money on pillows, but these were worth the money. These pillows are fine, but not worth the money.  I will keep them because it's a hassle to send back, but they are absolutely no better than two King size pillows I purchased at Costco for less than half the price.  I used to be in the pillow business in a former life, and I know pillow and pillow manufacturing.  These pillows are overpriced for what you get.  Again, they are fine, but should be less expensive. Great pillow! soft, cool and contours to support my neck. Definitely a good purchase and would recommend it! Unfortunately the pillows are too firm for me. The pillow itself is very plush, cool and comfortable. Though, I tried to use it as a regular pillow‚Äîfor laying my head on‚Äîbut found that my head kept sinking/getting buried between either side of the pillow. Didn't like that. Other than that; it is a good quality pillow for the price. If you like big, soft and plushy-like pillows than this is definitely the pillow for you! I always say if it's too good to be true it usually is when shopping online through 3rd party vendors. They can fabricate the discription of the product with clever wordplay and have you feeling like so disgusted when you receive your product and find out you've just been robbed of your hard earned money. This is not the case with these pillows. I actually feel like I did the robbing for once. Yeeeeee!!!!!!! They are 5 star hotel quality. Your head will sink into them but still feel supported. Bought one for my wife and myself, due to the good reviews. Didn't like it from the first day. The pillow is too thick, and I could feel the gel pack in the middle of the pillow which feels hard. I continued sleeping on it for a month to see if I'd get used to it. I still don't like it. Yesterday my wife told me she's been having regular headaches since using this pillow and she thinks it is too thick. Too soft, no support. These pillows are very comfortable. Great quality. Would recommend to anyone. Best pillow i have slept on They are a little soft to my liking, I didn't notice any odor there are made in China as stated they definitely are a queen size fit they're good pillows. These would be perfect if they were just more supportivee Pillows flatter than my butt. They seem to hold a lot of air that immediately deflates where you put your head.  A charming redistribution of stuffing and air to either side of your head that makes rolling over both an exercise for your mind and neck. If this pillow was in a hotel I was in I would ask for another. It is far from plump, full, or comfortable. I only opened one and my head sunk in the middle.  Living in a rural area I tried to return it by UPS door pickup instead of traveling to a ship store. After 5 days and a call to Amazon they said to keep it and no charge. My grandaughter likes numerous pillows on her bed and even though she agreed with me on the quality she said she would scatter it among her others. Don't buy it if you like support. It was so hard it gave me a headache the first night. And it is VERY small. I missed the return window or would have returned. These pillows are just fluffy but it‚Äôs not the best thing ever they are just normal fluffy pillows. I sleep hot and these make me hotter than normal to be honest. Did not provide any comfort or support.  I broke down and had to get a $99 foam pillow because my neck was in so much pain from inadequate pillows. This pillows off no support for side sleepers.  They flatten easily.  You get what you pay for. I use them between my legs now. The product arrived as specified.  However, I was expecting more support.  They are comfortable for now, but I feel they will not hold up for long. There are pretty bad. They are way too soft. You might be able to make them work if you‚Äôre a back sleeper, but if you‚Äôre a side sleeper, FORGET IT. You might as well be sleeping on your mattress. I‚Äôm writing this at 6am, as I just woke up with a sore neck for the last time. Time to go pillow shopping AGAIN. does not support my neck, made me sneeze a ton and the shape is now dented in the center only had it since january Not comfortable , the pillows are extremely to soft , don‚Äôt provide enough support ,!! I slept. These are great pillows, just not for me. They are way too plush, somewhat firm, they are extremely full. Maybe good for someone that wants a huge pillow. To big for me."
12,"Bio-Oil Skincare Oil, Body Oil for Scars and Stretchmarks, Serum Hydrates Skin, Non-Greasy, Dermatologist Recommended, Non-Comedogenic, 4.2 Ounce, For All Skin Types, with Vitamin A, E",Beauty and Personal Care,"I purchased oil because I saw a lot of post on Pintrest about it. Needless to say my scars are still visible and have not faded at all. I've been using this since before I started showing...I. having twi s so I'm gonna expect some stretch marks but this is ridiculous...it claims to help but doesnt. Don't waste your money. Smells like skin so soft. I like that smell so I‚Äôm ok with that. But I got a blistered itchy rash everywhere I put this oil and gel. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just something that happens to some people. First time trying it Purchased this with little hope and have been using it daily. After a week, I've seen my stretch marks from being pregnant start to fade away. I've also used it on my skin to make it more evenly and on my scars in hopes of fading but have yet to see results. 4 stars because I still have hope and although it's oily, it isn't messy. I won‚Äôt put lotion on my body because I can‚Äôt stand the feeling! This is light and absorbs well. My skin and I love Bio-Oil products! This seems like one of those products that doesn't work for everyone, but it seemed like it could work for me... But I guess that's not case. It hydrates my skin and leaves a smooth finish, but dark spots and stretch marks have rarely faded because of this product. It doesn't matter how much or how less you use, this results are pretty simple. If it was slightly better I'd buy again. Haven't truly seen a difference but my sister has. I guess I still believe in the product due to the fact that I still wear it. I don't really have anything positive to say about this product other than it arrived on time.  It has a really strong smell to it that reminds me of old, chemically perfume.  I had read many suggestions to use it for easing stretch marks during pregnancy... those suggestions were wrong.  It did nothing for the itching and stretching irritation, even with numerous applications.  Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on it. have not noticed a difference Literally the 1st ingredient in this product...MINERAL OIL! Smells like herbs as well, returning ASAP. Pretty straightforward I love it. First-time received box was opened and there's no sealed lid inside. Re-requested second time and received the same condition. Still waiting for final three months of use to provide full detailed review. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just my skin or not but seems like it made my skin break out and way more susceptible to scarring. Have more scars and marks then I did when I first restarted using it Smells very pleasant, I don't feel as sick as compared to the artificial scented body oil. haven‚Äôt tried it yet but people were saying they‚Äôre getting off brand versions of this oil but i got the real thing scent lasts long haven't seen any real noticeable results This does not work and causes more acne by clogging pores. The smell was a complete no for me. Couldn‚Äôt continue using it because of it. Might just be my pregnancy nose. A lot of reviews say this isn‚Äôt the real product and wish I had read these before purchasing. I do use it a lot and went through the bottle in less than a month without noticing much of a difference in my skin. I purchased another brand and it works much better and have left a great review for that product. It‚Äôs too expensive to go through in less than a month. Not authentic bio oil!! Has strong straight up tea tree oil smell and is pink. If you shake it up it produces bubbles like soap when it should not. I admit that I purchased this before looking at the ingredients.  The upbeat add sold me.  Howeve the minute I put it on, I knew that I had been bamboozled.Whatever effect people think they have found is actually no different than consistent use of a moisturizer placed on skin and the sealed with Baseline, petroleum jelly, or mineral oil.  Peep the ingredients.  The first clue that this product and its claims were hype is the fact that the oil is mostly mineral oil...the same product that undergirds all of vaseline's products.  Those clinical tests are not vigorous scientific clinical double blind trials.  The n is too small. The time span is too short. Et cetera but this does not stop them from telling you that in order to ""see improvements"" you have to use their product for 3 months.  I repeat, no better than consistently, appropriately using vaseline.Buy it if you like potions, magical thinking, and have no concern for efficacy.  Maybe this is the product for people who don't know how to properly moisturize their skin like ""dihydrogen monoxide"" is for people who want to quench extreme thirst.C'est la vie.Aside - it has a mild, offputing afterscent that I worried about everytime I used it.  It is like a ""clean"" day care bathroom. Been using for 8 years. Get compliments from medical professionals about the softness of my skin. really good but i hate that it smells like old lady perfume üòí Felt good on the skin but smelled pretty bad. Like moth balls and wild flowers. I started using this my second month of pregnancy, and I enjoyed the smell and absorption. However after using it for about a week, my skin became incredibly itchy and started peeling off. It took me a couple weeks to figure out this was the culprit (I occasionally have psoriasis and eczema breakouts). I thought this was for sensitive skin, but I suppose my skin is an outlier. Glad it works for other people, but I could not use it unfortunately. Thankfully my skin healed from peeling within a couple weeks. Sleek. Absorbs well nice subtle scent. A little goes a long way. So I LOVE this! It rubs on nice and I feel like I dont have to wait too long to pull my pants up over my stomach after applying. Also to scent isn't overwhelming or strong which is great! Been using it for almost 2 months now and still not sick of the smell! But with that said I don't believe I'll buy another bottle bc it doesn't have a pump. Its super inconvenient to have to squirt it out especially if I'm going back for more...If they updated this product with a pump it would be the best. I may repurchase it if the one I got my last two pregnancy is still out of stock (which is why I bought this one in the first place lol) but not sure bc it really does bug me not having a pump. And yes I knew it didn't have a pump when I bought it but didn't think it would be that annoying not to have it. If you have minor skin irritations, dry skin, or slight scars this oil will help. It's very light weight yet extremely moisturizing. I can be used on top of any any lotion or cream or mixed with them. It smells great too. Personally, for my stretch marks it did n't so much, but they are very deep. Not the real deal, leaves you extra oily.. quality not as good.. I've been using this for quite some time now! And I honestly haven't noticed much difference. I was really looking forward to this helping me out with some scars etc. I thought it'd work much better & for how long I've been using it.... Idk, if I'm doing something wrong... I follow directions. Etc. Idk, I'll cont. Ato use it & see what happens...... This has to be a fake. I‚Äôve tried it for 2 months with absolutely no results. Great product, currently 23 weeks pregnant and no stretch marks so far! I am starting to have itchiness though I wish it help with the itchiness It might cause allergy Dried me out and caused itching and a rash!! It smells awesome but it‚Äôs not worth the reaction. Please test this on your skin!! Good value for money Face body love thisoil It was an okay product, I used it nightly. Didn‚Äôt cause a reaction which is great, but also didn‚Äôt necessarily improve my skin in any way. I tried ordering this product before and it was on backorder for so long the order was canceled so after finally getting it after more than a year I was actually kind of disappointed I guess I just expected it to be more than what it was. I can just as easily use my Neutrogena light sesame oil and get probably even better results The claim that it is ""non greasy"" is not true for me. I feel so greasy for hours after.There is a STRONG fragrance if you are sensitive to fragrances (like I am) it is not the product for you.I want to keep the test up for the full three months to test it on my scars but the fragrance and greasy feel is too reach for me. Works wonders! Has a strange smell, not sure if it works yet Makes my tummy and back break out but really does work better than most things. I‚Äôd use it next pregnancy from the moment I found out. Acne or no acne, it helps stretch marks fade and keeps my belly moisturized I‚Äôve been using it consistently like it states but I haven‚Äôt seen much of a difference. :( I  did not receive the product :( I guess it would be OK if you can put up with the smell. This stuff is great! I have a lot of dark spots on my chin from pimples, and this has helped to clear it up. I don't use it when my face is extra oily, because it will add extra oil and contribute to breakouts. But it has really made a difference in my skin! It‚Äôs an ok oil so far only been using a few days now. I got the oil to help with scars on my body because I read that‚Äôs what it was good for. My first impression of the oil was the smell wasn‚Äôt that appealing to my taste. My skin didn‚Äôt absorb it fast which left me feeling moisturized longe. I did not have have any bad reactions to it so so far so good. I bought the product for my eczema skin issues. However, It did not good but worse my rashes. It's sad since I really like how well it moisturizer and soften other skin areas. Works okay to moisturize skin. No decrease in marks/scars and I‚Äôm 85% of the way through the bottle. Came unsealed. Returning. Broke me out a little bit and i made sure to be super careful. Needless to say i proceeded to immediately trash it.Sensitive skin people be wary of this, vitamic c serum will work just as well and not POTENTIALLY break you out. it is oily,  does not absorb into the skin, tried it for 3+month twice a day, my son's scar is not fading or anything.  Only good thing is this does not cause any allergy or make the scar worse.  I am not happy with it since I spend so much time try to chase my son to put it on everyday!  Very Disappointed!!!  Really wish it worked... Still getting used to how oily it is. And idk if I‚Äôm not using it right but I haven‚Äôt seen any changes to my skin and I use it twice a day everyday. Like I didn't even want to give them a star at all. this product is fake. I have the real bio oil and its much lighter in color. this fake one is a dark peach color. what made me really realize it wasn't real is when it made my face itch. my face never itched from using bio oil. Thus item never disappoints me! 4th time purchasing it I got this product in November 2020 and I used this religiously every night after my shower. It‚Äôs February 2021 and my stretch marks look the same. Sad face üòû time to try something else. Love the soft scent and light feel - not too oily. Unfortunately it hasn't really diminished scarring or stretch marks but I only use once a day. Purchased twice because it feels nice on the skin but probably won't purchase again due to high price. This smells so good and I actually see a difference if I use it consistently Received a week after order date and no apologizes at all. Got scar where I used it I have always been a fan of oils on my skin!! So this was a must and so many moms recommended so I am giving it a try!  I love the way it smells because it is not over powering. The oil is light and a little can go a long way all over!! I apply this twice a day, once in the morning and in the night. Then put on a big T and off to bed! It doesn‚Äôt make clothes stick to my skin nor does it make stain. Get it!! Make my skin smell good and smooth I will get more when I finish the one I bought. 02/24:  I just got the 2oz bottle today and it smells wonderful! It absorbs just as well as coconut oil!I am about 19 weeks pregnant and put this on my breasts due to the stretch marks that just appeared. Aside from my breasts, I'll be using this Bio-Oil on my belly and thighs to help prevent other stretch marks from appearing.I plan on updating this review throughout my pregnancy. Really have high hopes for this product going by the reviews!03/05: Sadly, I'm going to have to stop using this product. Rashes have formed in the areas where I've applied this oil. The worst ones were on my breasts where I've applied the most oil. Maybe I used too much product? Either way, I'm going to use coconut oil in place of the Bio Oil. At least until my rashes go away and I'll try again at a later date. Love it's not too oily, it could have a better fragrance Great for very dry skinLeaves a pretty shine Great deal. My husband is light skinned and never used cream on his body. His arms are the sturdy so I used this once with immediate results. Smells nice and spreads so easy. Returned I've been using the product for more than a year now. on and off. I. do not see a change to my beauty scars. I used it for weeks on end and have not seen much of a difference. I would still recommend for moisture especially, on the upper body. I have been using this for months still not significant change. Everyone is differ so it may remove scars with less pigment than I do;  it for me it isn‚Äôt doing what I thought it would. I still sue because it does make my skin soft just hasn‚Äôt removed any of my scars yet. I like the smell, it feels light and not greasy. My skin feels sof and hydrated after use ordered this & when I received it the post was already open and smushed. It smells kinda nice though. But the packaging is terrible . When it first came out, I used it and was amazing but now i can‚Äôt not find the real stuff I really enjoyed this product. The scent isn‚Äôt awful but it definitely isn‚Äôt pleasant. I have very sensitive skin and I‚Äôve had no issues at all. I use this oil after my shower nightly, and wash off what ever is left over the next morning. It is an oil so I do not use it durning the day for the sole purpose that it makes my face super shiny. I can‚Äôt say if the product lives up to its intended use, but regardless I love this stuff. I also have only used it on my face so I can‚Äôt comment for use in other areas. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs moisturizing but it‚Äôs for sure hydrating. I can‚Äôt wait to see what it does for my skin in the winter. And I will say my natural skin seems to be so radiant and glowing after using this consistently. I'm very upset. This was delivered burst open. Everything threw away. Ruined my other purchases as well. I need an immediate replacement!! Doesnt work  at all!!! Very thin oil that doesnt do anything for the skin Love how it makes your skin soft and smells great haven‚Äôt seen any results for stretch marks or un even if the skin I used on my face ann broke my face out real bad I applied this oil during my pregnancy and after and used to massage daily twice. It reduced my stretch marks. It is very important that we massage the belly daily to avoid dirty stretch marks. Very good for healing scars when used with a fresh wounded area. Also used starting around week 35 to prevent tearing during childbirth and it worked great! The scent is the only thing I would change about it, not a great smell. Didn't see a difference, if anything my skin was even dryer due to lack of moisture If it‚Äôs work for you then go for it. I order 4 times and will continue I have been using this product twice a day as instructed for a week now and I have a rash developing. Anyone else experience this?? Very disappointed whole bottle gone Started using it on my 2nd trimester and it helps relieve itching. Not too strong and not too greasy. Though my stretchmarks were still visible. I bought this product for stretch marks and I can‚Äôt say for sure this oil did anything to my skin other than moisturizing it! It is not the real deal Bio-Oil.  The oil is very thin, not like the original. It hasn‚Äôt removed any marks on my body as claimed. I don‚Äôt like it Great! I‚Äôll buy again I‚Äôve never bought this product before but it might be fake. The box was opened and the product had no seal whatsoever. Product is great if you‚Äôre skin needs hydration. Didn‚Äôt do anything after applying 2-3 times a day for 3 months. Tested on both old and new scars with no results. I‚Äôm happy for all the ppl that had success. Just wasn‚Äôt one of them. I would consider this product again for a winter time moisturizer. I like the scent but not good for the scar lighter I just started using this, so can‚Äôt really  comment on long term effects, but so far I like it. It smells nice, as moisturizes well.  It feels good on my skinUpdated  Pros  Smells good  Have seen some lightening of dark spots  Moisturizes well  Cons  It‚Äôs oily (but probably why it is such a good moisturizer).If you don‚Äôt mind oily, I would recommend It's different but I still went back to the individual oils. This seems like but dries quickly. To me it had an odd feel after putting on skin , but I'm very sensitive. Bought this for my post op knee replacement scar, working great.  Ut I have also been using on my nail and cuticles, and they have healed up and strengthen my nails, nice surprise! Will continue to order. Quick turnaround time from order to delivery but when I opened the package the box was damaged. Luckily, the actual product wasn‚Äôt leaking or it was definitely getting returned. I love this stuff and definitely in need since I‚Äôm further in my third trimester, I am not willing to go through the hassle of returning only to run into the same issue again. Figured might as well keep it. Please do better with the packaging though. Highly disappointing. being using it for some time I haven seem that much of a difference but it does makes my skin more soft used it for 2 months , don't see much of a difference I think the oil has an unappealing scent.. but it does feel good to apply and I notice some tightening in the skin and stretch marks the next day in the places I‚Äôve applied it This is not the real bio oil. Very pleased with this item. Will use your company again. First time using bio oil. Bought the biggest bottle, as I‚Äôm planning to use it throughout my pregnancy.Seal or no seal: there is NO seal. There are so many conflicting info in the reviews and the Q&As. So I actually went to the local drug store and got one to compare. Same thing, no seal. The one I got from the store is the smallest size.Maybe years ago it came with a seal? I don‚Äôt know. All I know is that the current version doesn‚Äôt. So please stop calling it a fake because of that.Pros:I developed dry/red/flaky skin around my mouth since pregnancy. I tried lotions, serums and oil based essence but none of them last more than a couple of hours before the skin becomes dry and flaky again. I tried this bio oil around my mouth, it actually would keep the area moisturized very long. I do wash my mouth after meals and re-apply, so I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôd last a whole day, but it has been dramatically longer lasting than my other products. The redness is also reducing overtime. Not completely gone yet, but previous the redness was surrounding my mouth area, now it‚Äôs only at the corner of the mouth and above, nothing on the chin any more.My husband is also using it on his knuckles on one hand that‚Äôs itchy. It seems to be helpful for his skin condition too. We don‚Äôt know exactly what that is, the doctor just asked him to put anti-itchy cream which isn‚Äôt very helpful. This oil does help so he‚Äôs been using it.Cons:Gosh for me, it has to be the smell. I honestly thought it was a fake product when I first tried it because I really don‚Äôt like the smell! Some reviewers said they love the smell or it comes with a pleasant smell, no it doesn‚Äôt! That‚Äôs another reason for me to get one from the drug store to compare. It turns out that‚Äôs just how this thing smells. It has a a pretty strong oil smell that reminds me of industrial oil products. It doesn‚Äôt come with the any flowery or pleasant smell, not even like the basic no-smell oils, but actually something I dislike. So be forewarned. If you put a little on your palm, the smell isn‚Äôt strong, but if you rub it in, like on your tummy or on your face, holding your breath for a few seconds won‚Äôt do it. Since I do use it around my mouth, I even tried to mix it with my other non oil based serums to cover its smell a little, which helps but it also reduces its moisturizing effect. Since it‚Äôs the only product that works with the dry skin around my mouth, I‚Äôm biting the bullet. The smell doesn‚Äôt linger for long, so that was helpful.If you are not sure about the smell, get a small bottle to try it out. At least for me, the benefits out win the smell issue for me.Funny that I‚Äôm not mentioning any stretch mark effect as pros or cons. I actually have developed some stretch marks on my lower back and my butt cheeks before using this product since the pregnancy, not on tummy yet. I don‚Äôt expect the product to get rid of the existing stretch marks or at least not in a short period of time. Maybe in a few months it‚Äôd get better over, and more important to me is for prevention of new stretch marks. Doesn‚Äôt feel oily, good hydration. Welp, I don't have any scars soooo yeah. Lol Someone needs to help me understand because everyone is saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúfake‚Äù but I purchased one then read these reviews and decided to purchase one from Walgreens and it had the same consistency, same smell, same color, it was literally the exact same thing. I loved it!! Just what I needed to help healing of incision from TKR. I have been using this product for 5+ months and i mainly used it for stretch marks. I didn‚Äôt really see a difference until 3 months ish. My stomach stretch marks have almost completely disappeared but the stretch marks in my sides have just faded but are visible. It arrived quickly but the bottle is outside of its box completely inside the mailing bubbled envelope. Got this oil to help with pregnancy and avoid stretch marks. I oil up every day. Still got stretch marks. The bottle it comes out of it messy and you don‚Äôt see it when you set the bottle down but it collects around the top and as soon as you set it down it drips all over the bottle and the surface you set it on. Smells like an old lady. Was not impressed AT ALL I‚Äôve use this product for a healing scar, post surgery as well as while I‚Äôve been pregnant. It was recommended to me by friends and my doctor. I have noticed a huge difference in the healing of the scar. On its own it would feel tight and itchy and sometimes it would also become raised and irritated. Since using bio oil on the scar I have no irritation, it‚Äôs soft to the touch and it has flattened a lot. I can‚Äôt say it has reduced much of the redness of the scar however I am much more comfortable now. While being pregnant I apply bio oil after I get out of the shower and this has left my body feeling very moisturized throughout the entire day. My belly has not been very itchy due to stretching and I believe it‚Äôs because I use this oil regularly. The smell is very neutral which I appreciate. And I was initially worried about the oil leaving residue or staining on my clothing but I have had no problems with that. I‚Äôve bought several bottles of this over after I have ran out. I plan to keep this on hand after my scar fully heals and when I‚Äôm done being pregnant just to use for a heavy-duty moisturizer from time to time. Highly recommend! Love this oil. I used it pregnant and now postpartum. I love this stuff! I give it to stars because I used it 2 months on a dark spot and nothing change but it appears to be a good lotion replacement that‚Äôs about it Really oily, doesn't absorb much so i feel like most of it gets on my clothes. Second pregnancy im using this with and it did, i think, a pretty good job last time to prevent many stretch marks. But because I'm working full time this pregnancy i dont have as much time to walk around and wait for it to absorb, so im not using it as often as i should.. Smell good the texture is good but doesn‚Äôt make any ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù as promised The ingredients I read about this product on the product page were not the same on Bio-OIl Skin Care Oil 2 ounces (though I am sure the ingredients are the same on any amount of the product).On the amazon product page it listed Calendula Oil as the first ingredient.  Wrong. Here is a list of the ingredients. Generally, ingredients are listed by what they use most of in the product so for Bio-Oil it is mineral oil, followed by the second most used ingredient Triisononanoin, then the third most used ingredient Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate and so on.Mineral OilTriisononanoinCetearyl EthylhexanoateIsopropyl MyristateRetinyl PalmitateThen it lists the more natural ingredients which there is a very small amount of:Sunflower Seed OilTocopheryl AcetateAnthemis Nobilis Flower OilLavender OilRosemary  Leaf OilCalendula ExtractSoybean OilBisabololTocopherolFragranceAlpha -Isomethyl IononeAmyl CinnamalBenzyl SalicylateCitronellolCoumarinEugenolFarnesolGeraniolHydroxycitronellalLimoneneLinaloolRed 17 Good for my skin Use the product daily. Haven‚Äôt noticed any improvements in finishing stretch marks or dark spots but it is very moisturizing. it‚Äôs bit greasy, but it‚Äôs keep my skin moist. I think I just have to get used to it. This stuff is amazing! Especially for pregnant mommas! It‚Äôs helped to avoid skin being itchy or irritated while stretching and so far no stretch marks! only one month left so fingers crossed! I use this product for stretch marks throughout my pregnancy. In my opinion it helps if you don‚Äôt want to get stretch marks but doesn‚Äôt help remove stretch marks. Didn‚Äôt do anything at all. Spent $17 on nothing. Love the results.  Just a few weeks of use and my dry skin has been improved.  I have scars that need to go si I am religiously using this.  Love this oil and will need a second batch soon so I can finally have  flawless  soft skin"
13,"Blink Mini ‚Äì Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, night vision, motion detection, two-way audio, Works with Alexa ‚Äì 1 camera",Electronics,"This was the third blink I attempted. In the time I wasted to try to make this work I could‚Äôve bought a better quality camera that actually works.Two major issues: picture quality and connection.Unless you‚Äôre very close, forget trying to make out a figure in the picture. Think cell phone camera quality from 15 years ago.As for connection, we all use this cameras for the sole purpose of when we‚Äôre not around. The camera would constantly deactivate and disconnect from wifi. The first camera I got I actually contacted my internet provider to upgrade my services, but even after that the camera would still drop and not reconnect.I got this for use in a small office space during night time and every morning I came back it it would be offline. It is actually supposed to tell me when it‚Äôs offline, which it didn‚Äôt. But no way of resetting it without being physically there and more than likely to reset the wifi too.I‚Äôve spoken to their customer service multiple times, kind and knowledgeable but still they seemed frustrated because they knew this camera doesn‚Äôt have the capabilities it should have.I missed the cutoff to return this last one, probably because I‚Äôm tired of dealing with crap electronics.Buy this if you want to constantly tend to it, make sure it‚Äôs working properly and okay if it drops off when you need it the most. Cameras are I reliable. They turn off intermittently. If you need security, don‚Äôt buy these. Look for a better quality camera. I bought this camera for home security to be able to record any incidents that might occur while I‚Äôm not home. A month after I bought the camera the greedy company decided that instead of allowing us to save a certain number of videos, now they won‚Äôt allow any amount of videos to be saved‚Ä¶ unless you sign up for their monthly subscription. So basically the camera is pointless now unless I want to pay more every single month just in case I want to record one of the videos. There are lots of other cameras out there that don‚Äôt force you to pay monthly just to use it. I wish I would‚Äôve gotten one of those instead because I‚Äôm not going to pay monthly for the rest of my life for a camera I *might* need to use. How ridiculous. I recommend buying a camera from a company that ISN‚ÄôT looking for any possible way to take more money from you every single month. What a joke. Been trying to set it up for 2 hours now. Can‚Äôt figure it out. located in basement safe room.  Speaker volume needs to be a little louder. The mini works pretty good most of the time but periodically doesn't catch motion. I made some adjustments and it now seems better. The motion detection on this camera is faulty or perhaps it is just the app that has a flaw. There have been several instances where it does not alert me that my baby is moving when he clearly is. As soon as I go in the room and pick him up then I get a notification of movement. Do not recommend using as baby monitor for this reason. Something or someone has to pass by the camera (left to right) in order for the motion detection to work. The camera motion detection does not work if the camera is pointed at an area you want to monitor. I like that it's wired so doesn't fail like the battery powered cameras. Would not have bought it if I realized that Amazon would block me from using it without a subscription. Doesn't work at all. Not because it's broken, but because the vendor deliberately bricked it. Spent hours fighting with this piece of junk and it still doesn‚Äôt work ! This thing also shot down the internet on my pc. I've had Blink cameras around our house for about 2 years now.  I recently added 2 blink mini cameras on an indoor use basis.  My only downside I've noticed recently is that it doesn't always pick up the motion and start recording when I have it set as armed.  I do like that there is no monthly fee for the Blink camera system.  The picture quality is great too! This camera is absolutely amazing. The sound quality is phenomenal,  the picture is great, literally my only complaint is that the live view times out so fast. Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to battle with that. So unless I did something wrong, you can't view this camera from your echo show, and there doesn't seem to be any other interaction available with Alexa, which I was excited for.  (No live view from Alexa).  That said the camera itself works just as expected and seems to be high quality...makes me feel a little more secure when away. A bit too sensitive to late and when it‚Äôs too dark it doesn‚Äôt work well with motion detectors The ‚Äú Motion detector‚Äú doesn‚Äôt work at all, the night vision is a joke.. save your money The app is easy to use.  We bought this camera to monitor a puppy.  We unplug when we are in the room bit it quickly synchs up once plugged in so we can monitor the puppy.  Easy touch zoom with sound and the ability to talk remotely.  Great price for massive functionality. The quality of the picture and the night vision are great. I got this on the recent Amazon truck special.  I was wanting to buy Blink outdoor cameras but hadn't pulled the trigger yet.  When I saw this I decided to get it and see how well it worked. I'm obviously in the minority with my review but it didn't work at all for me. Tried to connect this thing too many times to count.  It wouldn't connect.  Suggestion from Blink was to download a third party router app that's rated at 2.5 stars.  It's bad enough that the Blink app is only rated 3.5 stars.  I shouldn't have to download other apps to make this thing work out of the box.  Every other device in my home connects and works flawlessly.  My Wyze cameras took no time at all to set up.  I'm very disappointed as I wanted it work and get some outdoor cameras too.  Oh well. I got one camera put up and it works. Well I went to put up the second one in the nursery, and I can‚Äôt connect because the serial code is already on another account. I‚Äôd appreciate if I could return this and get one that works or a refund Over all in pretty happy, but it seems to disconnect often ans you have to be preset to reconnect.The sound quality and picture are good for my purposes. Video quality is decent. There is a lag in time it takes to notice movement. Also I'm only getting ten second recordings. Video stops recording when I'm still moving around in front of the camera. I would say at best this is a nanny cam and not a good security cam.. I'm not really happy and I will seek a refund. There has been events that weren't captured as well. I've put this cam to the test and I don't recommend it. It would loose wifi connection.  It just didn't work for me. Works well with my other Blink cameras. I wish I had known you can only watch live viewing 30 seconds before you are asked to continue, how annoying this feature is and there is no way for you to change it in settings. I won't ever buy another one of these blink cameras again. I bought a cheaper one that was better than this Blink. Was going to use as a home camera, but was never able to get it to connect. Junk! Great picture quality.  But severe lag when going live.  Also a lot of unknown noise when viewing live feed.  Cannot connect with the Ring set up. In order to view video of motions you have to pay for a monthly subscription. They don‚Äôt tell you that before you purchase it! These cameras only record when they want to. Half of the time it won't detect motion and record. I have to trigger it (basically my way of waking it up) by doing a live view, then it will detect motion for a few hours and ""fall asleep"" on me. I was unable to get any help from customer service. Purchased outdoor initially. It recorded clips with limited storage In cloud at no cost which was fine. Now it asked me go subscribe for $100 a year to get any storage at all, and when I did, my outdoor cameras are not illegible?Blink is a waste of time scam. I bought this to be able to keep tabs on my bulldog when I‚Äôm not home lol works perfectly for my needs, and was super easy to set up! Decent quality video, really could be better. 4 stars for this.  I guess 1080p is just getting outdated next to 2k and 4k cameras. But for the price is dang acceptable. Nice wide angle captures more of the room then i had imagined. Not much lag. My ring doorbell lags 2 or 3 times as much as this blink mini. All the things that you are prompting me to write about are not functioning! The Blink was supposed to work with my echo-dot but when I tried to get it to work with Alexis I got a message that this Blink is not recognized by Alexis and will not work. The only way I can get it to function is by going to the Blink app and enabling it. Also the motion sensor doesn‚Äôt function either. Otherwise I can take still shots and videos if I use the blink app and manually turn it on and off. It is really disappointing that Amazon would advertise it and not back up it‚Äôs lousy performance. Now we have to pay for a subscription.The motion works 100 percent of the time, 60 percent of the time. I could not get the cameras to work with my Alexa App or Show 10.  1 hour with Blink tech support and then tried Amazon tech support.  I returned the cameras. I purchased this a part of an Alexa Show/Blink bundle. The Alexa Show is grea, with the usual smooth and easy setup. But the Blink was a TERRIBLE and BUGGY setup experience. And at least 50% of the time, saying ‚ÄúAlexa, show me the (blinkName)‚Äù will fail, just hanging indefinitely on a ‚ÄúWaiting for Blink‚Äù message. By contrast, Alexa will show my Ring Doorbell 3 cam perfectly and fast, each and every time. I recommend waiting until Amazon improves this cheap and poor-performing device. Maybe a V3 version will eventually have an adequate picture quality and performance. Don‚Äôt like it. No micro SD card slot. I‚Äôm being forced to buy monthly cloud subscription. If only I can return it. Attention Blink. Easy and Fast setup, app works perfectly A++ must have. Setup was a breeze, they are working perfectly. I hate it that after I received this great camera that you surprised me by  making me pay $3.00 a month to record the information which is different from my outside camera. You just destroyed your great Blink service. Why would you do that. It‚Äôs awful especially after I paid and received this camera. I tried setting these blink cameras up, but they don't work like the rest I have.  I wanted them for remote monitoring of 3D printers, but getting them to work like Wyze cameras isn't possible, at least for me (IT guy for US government).  I've got 2 (free with Echo Show) that are collecting dust, still in the boxes.Hope yours works for you. No one said anything about buying a subscription to blink and no my camera doesn‚Äôt record don‚Äôt recommend buying I initially got one to watch my cat when I went to visit my mother to make sure she was all right while I was gone. I sent then got some others and I put them outside to watch my yard. i've been noticing that they work and then they don't work it's like sometimes the Wi-Fi connection doesn't work. but it does help that I can use one when someone comes to my door and I can answer it that way through The app on my phone .that is a big help instead of having to open my door each and every time someone knocks. especially during this pandemic. Convenient Low Cost Two-Way Camera+Easy Setup+Easy App Install+Easy Linking to Alexa-Does Not Currently Support Arming by Alexa Guard, but does from Blink App. This is a camera where you get what you pay for.  Since you can‚Äôt put in internal memory I used the Blink sync module to store video locally.  Unfortunately this device forgets it has a flash drive attached on a regular basis ( different review done for the module).  The camera quality is average but the main annoyance is the you have to wait several seconds to switch between cameras if you have more than one.  You will get a message of ‚Äòlive view in progress - please wait.‚Äô  I don‚Äôt have this issue with any other brand of camera. I have experienced latency, (delay of seeing video vs. real time), on all three of the cameras I purchased. This is only a couple of seconds so not a deal breaker in any way.The set up was pretty easy and these cameras do work well with my Echo show 5. The image quality is ok.Not a good choice as your only security option. I use mine to monitor elderly parent in common spaces when I am working around the home. Along with a call button for my parent, these cameras let me check in and make sure nothing is a miss. These cameras are great for this purpose.I would not use for security due to the latency described. This is an easy setup once the app is installed.  I like the ability to arm or disarm the camera as needed through my phone/app. Love these cameras just wish I knew that you have to pay to keep any storage i have a ring doorbell and that just saves it in the app whereas Amazon you need a separate subscription just to keep videos of your security cameras While the camera will transition from day to night, the Blink mini (firmware 9.70) will not transition from night to day. Even with sufficient light on in the room with sunrise, the IR sensor remains on and motion is not detected so recording does not happen. Even at night if a light is turned on in the room, the camera will not transition from IR sensing to daylight mode and so will not detect motion. A security camera foiled by turning on a light! Evidently this is a long running issue with this mini camera as it was reported over a year ago now.It seems not fit for purpose.The only ways to work around this seem to be:1. Manually trigger a photo, live view, or disarm and immediately re-arm. This takes manual intervention and must be timed with sufficient day light in the space.2. Set a schedule to disarm and then rearm the camera. This results in at least 15 minutes of potentially lost recordings since schedules can only be set at 15 minute increments. (Maybe an Alexa routine can do this automatically with less of a gap in recording?)3. Turn off night vision mode and rely on a secondary light. So keep the camera in normal daylight mode at all times. Some use a separate motion detection light to turn on so that recording at night can still work.None of these seem like good enough solutions.Called support today and they said they were aware and working on the issue, but had no estimate on when it would be resolved. Maybe after a year of this being a known issue they can't resolve it at all? I returned mine. There was no place to plug in back of echo show five without an adapter. The YouTube video has how to videos the one I viewed it was shown being plugged into the back of the echo show, but no mention of adapter. In the back of show there is a micro usb port and the BLINK mini the micro usb end also plugs in the device. The Blink app I downloaded was a 30 day trial ...also a separate account which wouldn't let me change. Even after deleting and reinstalling blink app was on count down of my trial membership To much of a PIA..for me. I installed the camera before my trip to Yellowstone National Park. I don't know why but when I am out at the park where there is no cellular signal, the camera doesn't record anything. While I was in the hotel, the camera was recording motions (of my cats) and sent me notification. I contacted the customer service and got fast response but they didn't understand my issue. They wanted me to install an app near my home router to allow them to access my WIFI at home so they can see what's going on. I didn't feel comfortable about giving stranger an access to my home network so I ignored, and I was away from home anyway.As long as my cell phone is working the camera works fine. I was able to watch my cats enjoying quiet time. Great camera for the money ****** UPDATE PLEASE READ:  After having the Echo Show 5 and Blink Mini camera working perfectly as a puppy monitor, it basically quit working. Let me explain. I used the Show/Blink setup to notify me when my puppy would wake up at night so we could let her out to do her business.  It worked well (almost too well) by sending Alexa notifications to both my iPhone and the Echo Show.  I eventually turned the notifications off on my phone because I didn't need two things waking me up at 3am.  Again it worked for a while, then just out of the blue, it stopped notifying me through Echo Show.  I tried everything to  get it working again, but I was forced to start using my iPhone notifications instead.  Echo Show would still let me view the camera ""Echo show me Bella"", but no notifications when she would move.  Echo Show became almost useless since I can also  view the camera from my phone (and also speak to my pup which Show never could do).  Mind you, it has been taking 30 second video clips and storing them on my phone.  I got a couple that were YT worthy for their entertainment value (search Bella the Corgi).I put up with the notification issue until BLINK PULLED A FAST ONE ON ME!!!  A little over a month ago, I got a notification on my phone that my ""30 Day Premium Blink Trial"" had begun.  I did not sign up for the trial, so I thought nothing of it.  The other day my trial expired.  I went into my phone to look at the stored videos and now they all are LOCKED!!!  When I click on them Blink app tells me I need to subscribe to their service!!!! WHAT??!!!!??Now the Echo Show and Blink Mini are all but USELESS to me except to notify me on my phone when my puppy moves at night.  Echo Show's notifications are gone, and NOW Blink will not record.  The whole point of the security camera is to record!!  If I were to point my camera at my mail box to catch mail thieves, it would be absolutely WORTHLESS now since I'd have to be at the ready to view it live.  Anything not live is locked up and held for ransom by Blink.Amazon (who also owns Blink) is getting greedier by the day.  Shame on you for taking away the basic functionalities that I bought it for in the first place!******************Using the blink app on iOS you can use the ""Talk"" button to talk through the camera, however, this is NOT possible when using Echo show (5"" latest version) that is bundled together with this camera. Very long lag with live view the interface is not user friendly I am very unhappy these cameras. One was a gift and I purchased a second one and neither did them ever stay connected. Every day one or both go offline for no reason. DO NOT BUY! Nice camera but it‚Äôs a $charge to keep using it I love it.to view my home. I leave my elderly father at home all day and it‚Äôs nice to know I can check up on him from time to time. I installed it in like 5 minutes. That‚Äôs how long it took to take it out of the box and download the app along with it. It even has a microphone so I can talk to him. Buyer beware.  Complete bait and switch.  You will be charged a subscription fee for recording. I've already sent one back for that problem and the new one is doing the same. It's cheap for a reason. Don‚Äôt like that you have to pay a subscription! Works great. As advertised. I would buy again This is supposed to be a plug-and-play product. It wasn't for me; I couldn't get it to connect to my network. And once I found the well-concealed tech support contact info, it got worse. I left two messages requesting help THREE DAYS AGO and still have no response. I guess they don't want my business. Back to Amazon you go! Camera was working fine with the app, then I changed my wifi password and I can no longer get it to connect.  Had no issues for 5-6 months and now no matter what I do, it won‚Äôt connect and just spins in the app.  It‚Äôs useless if It won‚Äôt connect. At beginning I bought a camera that didn't work, but supplier checked it and send me a new one which works perfectly Our internet is 5G only and this camera only works with a 2.4G.  I couldn't set it up because of our internet.  I am returning the camera. Worked great until I didn't want to pay the monthly subscription. Not that I'm saving stuff a local drive one camera never records and the other only records during the day.  Weird how that just started happening. I love the camera, but it makes a clicking sound every time you activate the live view, which can alert a person to its presence, which sort of defeats the purpose if you‚Äôre using it as a monitor for a child. The picture quality and night vision on this camera is great; the sound quality isn‚Äôt super high, but it‚Äôs good for what it is. I‚Äôm giving this a two because it doesn‚Äôt detect hardly anything. You have to be right up on it and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even pick that up either. I switched from a SmartElf camera because I wanted something that was compatible with my many Amazon devices. Sometimes I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúAlexa, arm the kitchen‚Äù and she‚Äôll reply ‚Äúkitchen doesn‚Äôt support that‚Äù so the connection between the camera and my device isn‚Äôt super strong: little disappointed with that too. I never had any issues with motion detection on my SmartElf but I don‚Äôt really want to go back to that either. Overall just not happy; I don‚Äôt feel super safe and satisfied with this purchase. :( You have to have a subscription to see the videos saved didn‚Äôt know that till a month after I bought them Product stopped working after 8 months.  Plus, Blink discontinued the ""free"" storage and the security value of the device is nil without paying a monthly ransom indefinitely. This camera was okay until it started extorting money from me to continue using what i didnt sign up for.Now I know why its called Blink. It goes on the blink and eventually quits after locking you out for not buying there recordings of your so called security.No thanks China, stick it! Mines in the trash pile. only 3 stars cause of picture quality and the long cord i had to run up my wall. also only being able to view for 30 seconds on blink is a bit annoying Okay so I have had these for awhile now!! I bought them for my toddler when she sleeps because I hated the lollipop brand I  had for her.Pros: night vision, clearCons: makes a LOUD click noise every single time I turn the camera on on my app to look at the room, you can only watch live footage for 10-30 seconds max before it shuts off. It won‚Äôt let you watch for long periods of time like longer than a minuteIt honestly isn‚Äôt my fav I would probably try another brand. But it‚Äôs not horrible!But don‚Äôt buy it as a baby video system The mic voice quality is excellent. By far the best and most clear out of all the inexpensive cameras I own. Decent video quality. Haven‚Äôt tested out the night vision yet. The one thing I‚Äôm REALLY mad that it doesn‚Äôt have, and I wish I would have know this before buying, it doesn‚Äôt rotate. You have to manually move and angle it. So if you want to follow someone on your camera, you can‚Äôt. This is basic feature that I didn‚Äôt realize a camera came without. Now I know. üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº Love the camera for its quality, but would be even better if it could rotate itself from using the app. If it gets moved by the cat or whoever, you can't move it back until you get home. Bummer. I had a brand new one that I've had for one month and noticed that the status lights were blinking on it today.  The blink app showed that it was offline.  I could not get it reconnect at all.  Removed and tried to re-add, no luck.  Reset button on the bottom, no luck, it just stopped talking to Wi Fi for some reason.  I've got 4 other XTs that I have had for 4 or more years and they are working just fine.What should have been a quick call to support to get a new one turned into a waste of time dealing with support personnel that can only read from a script.  I ran through the nonsense on the phone up to a point where I finally told them ""Look, this is a month old and I am not wasting any more time with your script -- send me a new one.""  They finally agreed to do this, but then told me that the new might do it to since it ""could be my network""  Odd, I have four other cams that are working just fine and about 25 other devices that are working just fine.  This camera was working just fine up to the point that it died.Supposedly a new one is the mail -- we'll see.I have heard that blink support was a JOKE but I never had to deal with them until today.  I can confirm that it is indeed a joke.  I hope that I never have to deal with them again.  We wasted more time and MONEY  troubleshooting a 20 dollar camera than the product is worth.  Amazon bought this company -- they should fire all customer support immediately and take that support on in-house.  It can't get worse.Further, I am not too impressed with this camera that died 30 days in.... does not bode well. just right for my small office Got this to check on my pet and home while im out, its budget friendly, it alerts me when it senses motion, has live view, tiny so doesnt take up much space, night vison, two way audio to listen in and speak to room, plus the camera zooms in, easy to set up, quality audio and video and is alexa compatible! The only downside in my opinion is that it doesnt rotate to show 360 view nor does it allow an sd card however it does allow you pay for monthly storage. All in all its a great product and works as advertised our family loves it just wish it had those 2 other featurea but overall happy Good quality for price. Nice buy. Will purchase again Ever since the free trial coming to a close all I have is a buffering camera. I've call customer service they were having network issues. After a week it worked two days now it just buffers. All my other cameras work fine... Honestly this little camera was a cinch to set up. Came with easy to follow direction and was up and running in minutes. I was surprised at home good the picture quality is for such a small camera. I have it set up in my living room  with the front door in sight and am able to see everything across a large area even in the dark. im giving this a high score because overall it does what it‚Äôs suppose to do. the camera quality is good and the audio sounds perfect but this camera does not rotate ! i would love if it did :( so will be returning this I was excited to get this camera but so far I have been unimpressed. It seems to go to sleep or something. I have it in our living room and I get up early most mornings to find that it is not picking up anything. Only after I switch to live view does it start detecting on its own again. Literally the exact opposite of what you want a motion detector camera to do. It had a rattle when I received it but worked fine after I set it up.  It works pretty good, the sensors aren‚Äôt very sensitive when movement is further than 5 ft.  It won‚Äôt detect movement past that.  Night vision is pretty good and latency with the talk mode is minimal.  Would‚Äôve rated it higher if not for the rattle, like loose screw inside.  Picture quality is actually not bad, can see a decent amount of detail. Not a big fan of the live feed. Doesn't stay on and times our after like 3 minutes. Motion detection goes off even with no movement. So literally every minute my phone goes off because ""something/someone"" moved. 65$ - you get what you pay for. This doesn‚Äôt have the option of recording,It will stop showing the video after 1 minute. I have an older version, still in use. I would imagine technology has improved upon the little I I am not completely satisfied with. The night vision is OK, not great. The picture quality is ok.. The motion detection can be a little glitchy, and not always capture. Overall, I Have been pleased with this brand, and would likely purchase a newer version Easy to setup and connect to my Alexa enabled Echo Show. It works will, but it will miss some movement but overall I love it Camara stopped working after a month of use interior never been wet keeps on bringing the red light I tried everything now it‚Äôs to late to return I love these little things, picture is very clear from anywhere, this is one of the best gadgets purchase I've ever made, probably buy a few more to add to the ones I already have installed on my house,  installation is easy as 1,2,3 just what I needed, I recommend this product to anyone anytime, I'm very happy with my cameras and the best part is the price !! Made 10 attempts to install, camera finally needed updates, got it to install, but doesn't work Wish it came with free capture and not a subscription service. Like my Arlo system better but these were super cheap price to begin with. Doesn't always come up when I need it.  Has about a 5-10 Second delay.  And it is Literally sitting right next to my Wifi Router and I am in just the other room.  To me, isn't worth the $10 I spent on it on as a Prime day deal add on.  Picture quality is decent at best when it does work.  Push to talk is also extremely delayed with the picture.  I would return if I didn't way to long to find a place for it.  Will probably just go in a junk drawer. HORRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY this!!! Doesn‚Äôt record activity after 30 days they charge you a subscription fee to record activity. Would‚Äôve NEVER purchased this product had they been honest in their description Initially i gave 5 star rating, now i changed to 2 because of mandatory for subscription to record.Now i am planning to move other device which doesn't take subscription charges. It is a very nice inexpensive way to monitor and area without paying too much for monitoring services. The motion detection triggers easily with light variance so I sometimes get multiple alerts around sunset depending on light and location of the device. Otherwise, I find it very useful. The audio detection is extremely sensitive and impressive. I can hear conversations at the other end of the house when it is triggered. Picture quality is adequate but I would not say you are going to read a license plate but you can make out faces ok if it's close enough to the camera. I find it similar to a WYZE camera with a little more sensitivity. The WYZE has internal storage capability and about the same picture quality. The BLINK build and quality seems more robust. Easy to use software is a plus as well as seamless integration with Amazon Echo Show devices. If you have motion-detecting lights and point this camera at that area, it could work very well. I live on a busy road with a sidewalk and this camera had a very hard time picking up people walking by at night under a street lamp, but any tiny change in shadows or light it picked up right away. During the day, it worked fine. I would not recommend this if you plan on pointing it somewhere darker or anywhere with cars/light changes. If you have a driveway with a motion-detecting light or plan on only using this during the day I think it would work very well.Be aware, once the free trial period ends, you will not be able to use this at all. It will not work without a subscription. It won't turn on the camera at all. You'll have a decorative white box hanging from your wall, that's it. this camera worked good for a while and now I have to keep it unplugged because it stays armed all the time even when it says its unarmed.............and of course, it started doing that after I couldn't return the item.... Poor quality. Bascially given this camera away so you will sign up for monthly plan I like this little camera unit.  I caught it on prime day sale and used it indoors until my Wife made me put it in the garage because it was picking up every conversation we we having.  Actually it was meant for my garage to begin with.  The unit works well and was somewhat easy to install.  I had to do some breakdown of the unit to get the cord to run through the mount and the mount had to be placed in a way to get a proper application for video.  Hard to explain but it took some maneuvering of the mount to get it right.  The item works well when it stays connected but at times loses connection.  So I have loss of motion that I know occurred.  A little frustrating. Ok, shame on me asI don't usually write reviews, but I won't buy anything with reading everyone else's. I kno, selfish... But today, I'm redeeming myself. The camera itself is great, excellent quality, night vision, audio & motion detection. But don't buy this camera unless you're ok with having to push ""continue"" every 30 seconds to keep live view open.It's an app feature limitation, 1st set up bc the camera was battery operated and got too hot. New ones are AC powered, and this feature request is all over the Web and blink forums for years.Here on amazon it's packaged with Echo Show for cheap and NONE of the many reviews I read her mentioned it at all. According to reviews everywhere else but here, it's not an ideal baby monitor for this reason, but the price draws parents in since camara's titled ""baby monitors"" are 3-4x as much. But unless you want to press continue every 30 seconds for the hour your baby naps, while trying to get out emails or be on meetings, I recommend spending a few more dollars and go with a couple other options. The forum suggests the ""Xpi"" or named similar. That one is confirmed to all changing the connection duration. Good luck. It seems the distance doesn‚Äôt capture my movement, I‚Äôve been texting my camera. I need to get closer to the camera, so that it captures 10 feet. This camera is pretty bad. I'll give it that it was easy to set up, but other than that it's just terrible. The picture quality is bad. The night vision is non-existent. They want you to buy a subscription. You should just be able to watch a live camera feed from an app like most nice camera situations. But no this only lets you watch for a little bit and it's bad quality. The app interface is also pretty ugly. Cameron doesn‚Äôt really work too well but I guess it works for in your house good just not outside awful product. the fact that they would make you buy a subscription after you buy the device is unhinged. Ok it‚Äôs small but I think it‚Äôs good not noticeable the only think I am wondering I think I going to return is that is not showing reality carmera it only record only for a short minute I might this I need one that show real time carmera I like it but sometimes the video goes to black and white mid viewing I bought this camera because we were getting a puppy. The camera only record when there‚Äôs motion. You cannot look back at previous video and you have to pay a monthly subscription in order for the ‚Äúmotion‚Äù videos to save. I'm disappointed that I got a 2 pack of refurbished Blink Minis when I didn't order refurbished. I needed them though so I didn't return them. The camera's themselves are a good value for the price. I was looking for something that could continuously record or continuously stream this does neither. It's only records in 30 second clips, as for live feed you can only watch 30 seconds at a time. Does not suit the means I had at the time. Had to replace it with a different camera but better seated what I was using it for. The worst app ever. Very glitchy doesn't record half the time goes  out often Product arrived on time and well packaged.  I wanted these (Two cameras) so that I could monitor an ill pet and be able to talk to it if necessary to help calm it.Setup was typical Blink easy.  No issues.  The camera image is fine and unlike the battery powered units you can watch as long as you need to.  That was important to me.  The audio to me is also of good quality.  Five stars for that.Now the bad.....Using the ""talk"" feature results in a ton of screeching and static.  I suppose it ""could"" be feedback but the noise remains even if I move to distant areas of the house.  I will need to have someone else try to ""talk"" from farther away while I wat in the house and see if the problem persists from a greater distance.  For now the ""talk"" feature gets 1 star and drags the overall review down to three stars.  I would return these but I do need the video and that does work well.I have not tested the motion detection as yet.  I will update this as time goes by as the cameras are less than 24 hours old. We purchased this blink to put in our garage, at first we were real happy with the device until about a week ago when we were trying to hook up to Amazon cloud. We went through all the steps and then thought we had it until we received an e-mail telling us not to forget to connect it. SEVERAL e-mails later and we still haven't gotten it hook up.  In doing a google search it seems to be a constant complaint. Until Blink's customer service gets this issue taken care I am giving this blink camera a 1 star.Update. I am going to increase the stars only because the issue we were having has been taken care of. We purchased these back in November of 2020 somewhat knowing that they were fazing out the ""free"" cloud storage. We started receiving the e-mails and started getting everything taken care of to move to the Amazon cloud, well we thought we did. Fast forward to the end of May when my first e-mail was sent with a response few days later telling me how connect the account. This went on for over 2 weeks until finally someone was able to help me. We ended up having to unlink the blink to our Amazon account then reconnect and problem fixed.  We will now give it a 4 star and not a 5 because of having to pay extra  for the cloud service since the blink is now owned by Amazon It hardly ever captures motion. I would like to have one of these for every room in my home.  Great buy and great price. So after the free trail ran out. It Only records at night for some reason! Literally piece of junk! You get what u pay for! I walked right past the camera all day today and it didn‚Äôt pick up in motion during the day but at night it picks up recordings on the flashing light on my DVR box. Haha lame Does not remain connected to the internet.  have tried installation instruction. The Blink Mini works great! It connects to my Echo Show and was easy to connect. I am a little disappointed because you can only record live views if you have a premium. But it works great overall. We used it to keep an eye on kitty while on vacation. We were 3 hours away and camera/ videos came in clearly. We were more comfortable seeing her eat and playing while on vacation.  Great, affortable product This stops motion detecting past 8 pm for some reason. I can never depend on it. Sadly I bought the year membership and I feel like it‚Äôs worthless Great cameras. But the sound quality is absolutely terrible. I don‚Äôt think I am going to keep these because of it. I like how it picks up everything Really great picture for such a little camera! I'm super impressed with the quality of the images and night vision. I will be getting more! I took a star away because the audio will come and go. And before anyone thinks it‚Äôs the wifi, it is not. I have other cameras and I do not have this issue. Awesome for a low price little camera with motion detection. The motion detection needs some work. I miss the people but catch all the spiders at night. Blink is a great little camera! It‚Äôs perfect to jump in for live views or to communicate really quick. However, it only has 10 seconds of motion recording which won‚Äôt work for certain areas of home or office.For example, blink camera sucks as the camera for your garage My Q system. It doesn‚Äôt integrate with My Q so it can not be controlled when you are in My Q app. It works well with Alexa, but you can‚Äôt view it on Ring. So it will work for Key and it has a motion sensor when your garage door opens, but it won‚Äôt record continuously. You only get 10 seconds of motion. So you can see your garage go up and feet or ankles and when it comes down, but you would have to actually go to live view to see what‚Äôs happening, if you can catch it (Amazon delivery must be trained by elves or Santa himself because they are quick).  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I want everything recorded if someone is coming in my garage to leave a package. I might not have time to pull over in traffic or interrupt a meeting to go to a live view.So I moved that camera to my office, because it sucks to have not all cameras in one app.  But for the price or as a baby monitor or kids room; if is great! Have different security for entire house, just wanted something simple to use in a specific area to watch over my dogs. Have access to see and hear on my phone with app, works great. You need to pay for a app in order to get all of the capabilities the camera has. I actually like the camera. It‚Äôs easy to set up and connect . The view is clear. I had it facing outside in my bedroom window Towards my garage and it showed the picture clear as day. The only thing is it‚Äôs not continuous recording it‚Äôs 30sec so you have to keep hitting continue. And it‚Äôs only motion detection so if no one is moving in the room and it‚Äôs armed it won‚Äôt save the recording but if there is motion it will save it. It‚Äôs not a problem for me because I got them for that reason for motion so I‚Äôm satisfied but if you like constant viewing don‚Äôt buy I didn't like that multiple people couldn't view live video simultaneously. Also sometimes it would stay on night vision even though there were lights on and it was set to automatic. Dislike the motion sensor. It doesn‚Äôt pick up most movement. Easy setup and good audio video quality GREAT! It does nothing unless you subscribe Works well, just wish the cord was a little longer.. wish it had a battery/charge option like a baby camera‚Ä¶ would be way better! Clear images and great value. Motion detection can be annoying if you have pets lol. My whole blink system goes off every time my dog or cat move or go in and out lol. At least I know it works. Delay is about 10-15 seconds. But not bad some are way worse Works well for my application.  Only downside is needs background light for dark or night viewing I have an elderly family member in a care home and needed some extra peace of mind that she was being cared for properly. This camera allows me to see what I need to see and the also check in with her. I can communicate with her from the talk function, which is wonderful because the cell service is horrible there, so we can communicate perfectly via wifi on the camera. If you have little ones or elderly family members this is a perfect buy. The only thing I dock the camera for is the night vision isn't as clear as on my ring camera but still excellent for the price. You also might use this camera to catch a cheating partner lol. View is limited The camera and picture quality is good. There isn't a continous live view, which I knew when I ordered them but didn't realize a continous view would be better. The lens does not track motion so veiwable placement is important.There is a monthly fee for storage.Overall a good camera for a decent price. Love this camera for exactly what I'm using it for to keep an eye on my kids while I'm at work and they're with grandma. I can talk to them through the camera and give myself a piece of mind I enjoy the compact size and great look. The system fails constantly. I keep seeing ‚Äòsystem busy‚Äô messages and I can‚Äôt access any camera. Today the ‚ÄòBlink Cloud‚Äô went down and I couldn‚Äôt access the cameras even though I wasn‚Äôt recording.It seems this system is plagued with the typical Amazon software that just isn‚Äôt quite ready to be deployed, but it is.Amazon, I‚Äôve spent several hundred dollars; please make this system do what you said it would. We got the camera with high hopes for home security. Unfortunately there are a couple of downsides. First is that there is a delay of about 5 seconds before the camera activates. By the time a burger sets off the camera they probably would not get a video of them. Second is the monthly fee. You get a free 31 day trial but, to actually store videos you will have to pay. Now, they DO NOT make clear what that fee is. I saw $79 but is that pere year or month. We looked at the Blink iutddor cameras. At $99 a piece with so many bad reviews, basically the same as the Blink indoor camera we passed. Without paying, you can s√©e a live stream but no recording. That does no good for the police. The outdoor has a SIM card and you can save recordings but without paying for the cloud you cannot see the videos on your own camera. Until I know how much this monthly fee is, we will not be using their cameras. Quick and to the point. These cameras will NEVER let you record when you want without paying that stupid subscrip[tion fee. Even if you buy the Blink Sync module (DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY) u cannot simply recordc 24/7 and store the footage on there. Nope. you can ONLY record 'clips' and only after motion is detected. These are the biggest scam and joke of cameras ive ever seen in my life. Do not fall for the same false advertising we did, because you CANNOT record ANYTHING. Works good we use it for when we are gone to work or on vacation, to keep an eye on the dog, and i love that it has a live view and also that i can talk  to whoever is in the view. for a mini camera it is super nice to have an i have had no issues with it. i have had it for a few weeks now . I purchased two cameras brand new I open the box and it was clearly opened with things pulled out and it was missing a power cable.  I needed the cameras because I‚Äôm going out of town so I had to hook one up and now I have to buy a power cable ridiculous Don't  buy this as their service is the worst ever. I bought this after reading the good reviews. In the last 30 days I don't think they've worked 2 days in a row without somekind of an error. You don't know when they are live or not as the servers they work keep crashing, customer service worst ever (takes days to reply back and always with pre written answers). Worst product ever!Amazon you should be Ashamed standing behind this! These are not recording/alert if you don‚Äôt access the app !! Original one star review: Camera stopped working 3 months in.  No damage and always mounted on the wall first the motion detection quit working the. The night vision was next and now it only works with lights on.Update: Customer service contacted me and tried to help me resolve my issues in a timely manner my camera was faulty but they replaced it. They are sending me a new one I will update later. Customer service was excellent Havingbsome Cyber security issues, product a bit difficult to setup, so many passwords these days Works OK but now I find out after I purchase I have to pay for a monthly recording don't waste your money it's not a good enough product to be paying a monthly price for!"
14,"Carhartt Men's Knit Cuffed Beanie, Black/White, One Size",Computers,"Best brand for beanies in my opinion, high quality material, and last a long time. This hat is not the trusty Carhartt hat of the past. I lost my favorite one on a train, so ordered this one. It is smaller and much less stiff. This could be a pro for others but I wasn‚Äôt too pleased. It feels much cheaper as far as quality. I expect a certain quality standard from Carhartt and this cheap acrylic yarn just doesn‚Äôt cut it. It is not as warm as the older model and also is very slippery on my head. I laughed at a fellow commenters comment, but she was right, there is lots of material on the one I received as well. It forces you to have a very wide band curled up if you snug it to your head.The knit hat itself is not a super tight weave but gets the job done. Seems very well stitched and should last me for years. Perfect hat but ordered black and got blue It‚Äôs nice, but it starts to fizz and lose quality after a short time. Almost seems like Carharts quality isn‚Äôt the same anymore.3/5 I really like the hat, it‚Äôs what I expected. My head is a little small so it was kinda long on my head, but I can adjust it to the way I want. Really tight! I generally wear a 7 1/8 fitted hat and it is tight.  It is warm though. Not worth the money Why me. I ordered this hat for my dad because he loves his winter hats. I received it in the mail and was so excited but confused because when I felt the package it was small, hard and round. I opened the package and it was most certainly not the product I ordered. I got a ‚ÄúEgg Timer‚Äù that changes color when you boil the egg to tell you that it‚Äôs done. WHAT. THE. HECK.Put too small because the timer is the size of my eyes and not what i ordered.Do not order. It‚Äôs a scam. It fits a little tight. Nice hat, warm, but too small to be comfortable. Yeah so no. Definitely not a men‚Äôs hat. Fits my 2 year old with an average size head. Would return but i took the tags off. Don‚Äôt order. This hat would maybe fit someone with a huge head, but even when pulled over my ears it looks like I'm being attacked by a bright orange sock. The pros of this hat are that it is extremely warm, and the color is great. Just wish it was smaller. I love this hat! The o to reason I didn‚Äôt give it a 5 stars is because I was lead to believe that this was an adult sized hat but it‚Äôs too tight for my husband. But it fits my son quite well so I did t return it. I bought another one for my other son and I have ordered another hat all together for my husband. Way too tight and small, unnecessarily so. The length and everything is fine but it‚Äôs so tight to the point that it hurts my head and doesn‚Äôt seem to want to stretch at all. Happy I got the beanie Carhatt really soft and fit really well good beanie Got this for my hubby, but, he could barely get it on his head. It SAYS it is for men, but, I don't know many men with a head that would fit this particular hat! Had to send it back. I bought this same item a year ago and it was great. This one is too small.""One size fits all"" doesn't apply here, it's too small, and stretching it too much makes it too tight to be comfortable. Not what I expect from Carhartt. I know it‚Äôs a men‚Äôs hat, but I was hoping it would fit a woman‚Äôs head. Unfortunately it was too big on me. There was a lot of excess fabric on top and I didn‚Äôt like the look of the hat standing straight up on top of my head. Great purchase. It's a nice hat, idk get it if you need one Super cute hat. Very warm, but you will need to stretch it out! Mine is very tight This hat seems rather small for a men‚Äôs. I do have kind of a big noggin but only for a woman in my opinion. Doesn‚Äôt stretch much either. If you like the big oversized beanie look then you are going to like this beanie. Personally I was going for a snug modern fit and had to return it.I can say it feels warm. The materials used are about what you would expect. My boyfriend loves it..Although you can deff tell it‚Äôs the cheaper one bc the top is super puffy.. next time will probably buy him the $35 one just in case bc nothing is shrinking this hat. Still super cute tho :) way too big, had to return I get these for my dad every year because since he is a highway worker. I love how bright they are to keep people aware of him, and they also keep him warm on the cold days. Loyal till the end. Love. very large but comfy overall Great hat!  Ordered ""on request"" for cool 21-year old daughter.  She loves it.  Everyone's happy. A little tight on my husband. Just doesn't seem as good as the one that is the same style and color that i purchased last year at Tractor Supply. very long This runs small. It is more of a youth sized beanie. Don‚Äôt put it in the dryer or will shrink If I wanted a brown hat I would have ordered one. Just update your product image already! This product is not like a traditional beanie. I feel like gangster rapper when wearing it. Way small for a men‚Äôs hat but nice quality It makes me have like a resivoir tip on my head and I have a peanut head. I feel the beanies slip up and up and see people faces as the beanie starts looking funny :/ good quality though It fit more like a youth hat. Non-waterproof,  ""mostly"" windproof,  great winter hat, almost gets too warm depending on outside temperature, I lost my last one and HAD to get a replacement, just about best winter hat you can buy for that price range with exceptions above. Beautiful lovely hat Nice hat but it is t the color that it‚Äôs advertised to be.  It‚Äôs much darker than picture appear and description describe. i used it as my hat and it was too small Very nice great fit I have multiples of these and this was not a men size... I don‚Äôt think it was even an adult size. Barely fits my 2 year old it‚Äôs so tight. Did I get infant size? Carhartt means Quality.I've worn these for decades and never been disappointed. It fits a little small Was the incorrect color than what i chose on the color select drop down menu. I chose DriftWood which is a sand/yellow and i received a dark grey beanie. Not for the average size head. This thing is huge. Returned it. Too big looks like a helmet Product came wet in packaging and smelled moldy. Expect better. So flattering, great quality Finally a beanie that actually covers my ears entirely. Don't like all the small beanies ou there. Also this feels like great quality and will last me years. I ordered two hats, just different colors. The blue one was so tight it would only fit a small child! I sent it back. Says OSFA. But it is very small, even too small for my 8 year old. Fake! Got mine from China. Once I saw the envelope it came in I realized why it took a month to receive. The logo label was stitched on crooked so I need to return it. I am a petite woman and it felt tight on my head. The quality of the actual hat was good, but because the logo is such a prominent feature of this hat I did not want to keep it. Other people say theirs came from China. I‚Äôm really not sure, the words on the bag are all in English but nothing on it says where it came from. I could fit 2 of my heads in it and I have a big head. garbage The blue does not match the photo. Returning it . I have this beanie in other colors, but the brown is super small. Almost like a child‚Äôs size. Fits more like a skull cap. I appreciate how this hat keeps its shape and doesn‚Äôt stretch out too much Fake carhartt beanie, all the way around. Have several beanies that were ordered directly from Carhartt the same week as this purchase. Fake fake fake. Sloppy stitching, stretches out quickly, etc. Just purchase directly from the brand and save yourself the headache. Smaller than the last one I bought. Color faded quickly after a wash It would‚Äôve been perfect if not for the extra space on top I like the comforter of it I bought several of these because of all the good reviews and ratings. They are just o.k beanie, noting special about it. It is more on the big fit. It does not provide as much warmth as I expected. And it goes out of shape after a month of use. The sizing is not consistent between each of them, and between different colors. Kind of disappointing. Love it. Carharrt never fails. Really comfortable Overall it a good buy. I would have liked it to be thicker but it seems warm enough. I've been looking for a skull-cap to wear at my job for the longest. I've found some but after a few times wearing it and washing they fell apart. The Carhartt Men's Knit Cuffed Beanie is durable and fits well over my head and ears and the material is well made. I will be purchasing more of these. If I‚Äôm being honest, I expect the beanie to be a bit bigger. Nonetheless, I‚Äôm still satisfied with my order Great quality, but too small for me. Gave it to the wife and she loves it. This hat is not an authentic Carhart hat!!! The logo is crooked and is very small!! The material itself is also not the soft warm Carhart material. Everything good except the little fuzzies all over it after its washed. I don‚Äôt know how this is a men‚Äôs hat. It is very small and very tight. It did not fit a mans head, it did not fit my head. I finally just gave it to my 9 year old daughter and it fits her head. Way to expensive for a child‚Äôs hat that wasn‚Äôt needed. It‚Äôs a nice beanie, just way too overpriced on here, found some at a sporting goods store for around 15 bucks, the exact same one way too tight on head Exelent All the different colors are supposed to be one size fits all, I have three others, this one, the 'dark blue/navy"" is smaller, won't stay on my head. Great  hat,  perfect for working outside in the cold. the materials of this beanie are very nice. despite this I ended up returning it because the hat was way too long/ large. I saw other reviews warning of this but bought the hat anyways. maybe for someone who has a larger head or more hair this might be a good fit but for me it looked awkward and too large on myhead For being a men‚Äôs hat it‚Äôs wayyyyy too tight. This beanie was way too small to every look good! Yikes!It does look good on some of my more European friends, though. It‚Äôs super long, if your looking for a long Beenie than this is for you but it‚Äôs definitely not the right fit or length. If you accidentally shaved your eyebrows last week, it's a nice hat. Let me just tell you, I have a small head. But these beanies are way tighter than I would have thought ""one size fits all"" means. They also sit atop your head differently than most beanies- the very top of the beanie just sticks up off your head (as though you have a pompom stuck under it). Ended up returning, hope this helps! Way too big. poor quality, questionable product. comparing whit the store same product.. Son loves it ! Quick shipping and just as described. I really don‚Äôt know how this is labeled as a men‚Äôs hat. I am female and have an average size head and this hat was super small! My children who are under ten, fit this hat. Had to return it. Bummer because it‚Äôs super cute and warm. Like it My son like it This color (hunter green/black) runs very small. Tight on both adult male and adult female. Quite itchy My boyfriend wears this beanie to work, and has been happy with how warm it is! Very simple, and quite comfortable. fit way too small for my head The hat fits big and the logo is off. I bought this beanie on a impulse. Couldn‚Äôt help myself.It‚Äôs not very  warmIt fits loose in my headIt‚Äôs too highI look like a dork !Good luck with yours. Fits great and very comfortable Product is MUCH too small! Doesn‚Äôt fit on a normal adult male, very tight. Also, the fabric is NOT soft, very scratchy. Super disappointed. Hey its Carhartt and like everything else by Carhartt I've owned, its good and well made BUT I did expect to feel a bigger difference in it keeping my head and ears warmer then some other brands.  I wish this hat was thicker and offered more warmth for when it's really wintry cold. To small for larger heads. Was a gift and was received as expected. Just like everything out there that states "" one size fits all"". It doesnt fit like how manufacture expects it. Unless youre an ""average"" sized person the fitment is alittle small. My rating is not against the amazon store but to the manufacturer of this product. My husband's head is the size of a normal man, but this was very snug on him. It is also pretty lightweight. I love Carhartt hats. Keep in mind that this style is the kind that is long on top, and leaves space between the top of your head and the inside of the hat. fits great and it‚Äôs real carharrt, love it ! This is a classic for a reason. Warm, comfortable, true to the colors shown. You can get this hat at a local shop for much cheaper though, so give your local retailer a call before committing to a purchase from Amazon. This beanie started falling apart after 2 months of ownership and out of 2 months of ownership this started to fall apart at the seams. I DO NOT recommend this item because it is coming undone. I like the hat, but I wish there wasn't so much fabric--you can't pull it all the way onto your head or it will cover your eyes, so that means there's a gap between the crown of your head and the beanie, making the hat pooch and pucker a little on top.  If you're looking for some slouch, this beanie is for you. This hat is not shaped for a standard human‚Äôs head. It fits nothing like my other Carhartt hat which my wife says doesn‚Äôt look like a colorful, acrylic head condom. Seriously, you‚Äôd need to have a huge cone head for this hat to fit snugly without an embarrassing amount of extra material on top. My wife teased me when I put it on and wouldn‚Äôt let me leave the house with it. She‚Äôs not wrong. Bought for gift Very cute hat but it‚Äôs small, and I have a small head! Felt tight at first but loosened up to a good fit after one wear Super small for compared to original black Cathcart cuffed beanie. The beanies were ok in quality but I ordered two; one came in what looked to be child size and the other larger more adult size.  They were obviously two different type beanies.  Aside from being different sizes, one was thicker than the other.  Strange if nothing else.  I let my kids fight over who got which one instead of returning ;) Not the popular style. Feel like I‚Äôm wearing the top part of a condom on my head. Way too tight for the look you‚Äôre going for. Undersized and maerial isn't same quality of past carhartt hats. I can only judge the hat by quality and fit. Person I purchased this for wears an X-Large motorcycle helmet andstocking cap stretches fits perfect.  Average size head to x-large, this will fit I liked this overall but was surprised how long it was.  Looked stupid wearing this as I felt like an Elf.I tried to double fold the bottom to make it shorter but it was too tight.  Maybe some people will like this but definitely not for me!  Elf fans - onwards! it came with the whole in the back! absolutely terrible! The beanie wore out of elasticity after 1 month which is surprisingly odd. Never had a Carhartt do that before Ordered the black and the Grey beanie but the black one was way smaller than the gray. Very disappointed as it fit like a kids beanie put it in my 5 year old and it fit her perfect. I do not like how deep it is but you can just fold it some more.  Plus I just saw Tim Dillion wearing it LOL Great hat but runs big.  If you‚Äôre female and buying this for yourself is gonna be big!  It‚Äôs also pretty scratchy if you have an issue with wool.  Other then that, cute hat Thinner than I expected for carhartt. My friend has the same hat and he recommended me to buy it, but mine was super large. The top of the hat was a lot bigger than his hat. Otherwise, the product has good quality fabric and looks nice. This beanie was way too tall! It fit well in the sense that it was snug to my head, but the beanie sat way to high and looked awkward. This hat is so big and weirdly shaped, like the top isn‚Äôt round. Also it‚Äôs extremely tall, I ended up cutting and sewing it to make it shorter, but the top shape is wack! Warm and cozy! Its a little small and ""rides"" up my head none of my other carhartt hats do that ü§∑ Amazing I wear this beanie every winter and fall, it‚Äôs the cutest color and my favorite beanie. This beanie is both too tight and too tall. I wear small/medium baseball hats.The thickness is good, but I bet it would pill after a few washes. Fits a little tight on my 7 3/8 head. Color is as shown. Real Carhartt brand. Wasn‚Äôt as thick as I thought it would be The stitching was a little messed up on the top part of the beanie when it arrived but I didn't think it would be an issue. After only wearing it a few times I notice the stitching is already falling apart and theres a hole! Would not buy again. Love this hat! I have a big head and thick hair and this hat fit great with still a little room. Super soft and comfy! Like that hat but shrinks in the wash real bad Love the color and the hat, however, it smells like mildew. Yuck! Top part is very long Hat was too small Bought for my husband. Much too snug for an adult but fits my 4 year old great."
15,"Castor Oil USDA Organic Cold-Pressed (16oz) 100% Pure Hexane-Free Castor Oil - Conditioning & Healing, For Dry Skin, Hair Growth - For Skin, Hair Care, Eyelashes - Caster Oil By Sky Organics",Beauty and Personal Care,"I can‚Äôt speak for what may actually be in here though it was well packaged and appears to be castor oil. Only for the girls with the hair loss and poor quality hair who prayed that this would fix it. It won‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre like me it will also lead to horrific acne and cysts even on your scalp even once you‚Äôve washed several times. I‚Äôm really disappointed honestly. Don't use very much don't see that it's helping grow my hair or eyelashes. Not sure it's Organic or cold pressed oil. I have dry and frizzy hair this castor oil made my hair soft and silky Please read up on this product before purchasing it i can not stand the smell in this product i only used once and that is about it Ok This product has definitely helped my hair but I would recommend mixing it with a lighter oil. makes a mess and no results for my use The texture is very tick. Didn‚Äôt see the result yet , though I‚Äôm using it since a week I can't see that this product does anything for my hair. Using this product as a healing massage oil for ankle injury. It is truly accentuating the rehab process. I have been using since last 5 months. I don't see any difference at all. Instead, it has led to increase in hair fall. I am a white woman with thin, fine, straight hair. I started massaging this product on my scalp 2x a week about 3 weeks ago in hopes of encouraging hair growth. But what I‚Äôve gotten is exactly the opposite: CLUMPS of hair falling out of my head when I wash out the oil next morning!! Be really careful with this stuff! I wish someone could explain to me what‚Äôs going wrong! Upon receiving my second bottle I oddly developed an eye infection which had to be treated by my opthmalogist. Took a break from using product. Not thinking it was this product I used it again. Very next morning woke up both eyes infected again. Love it! And it works great for my daugther.. its my second bottle! I'd like to say this product is amazing or that it smelled great, but I can't say that because I order this item October 15th & here October 29th I'm still waiting. I don't even know if the product was sent. Grrr! Good luck Just started this, a heavy product for your hair, hope it helps hair loss! Don‚Äôt like the scent of it Bought this 2nd time to gift it. Healthy for hair growth Don‚Äôt buy this product after using it my wife hair been falling like crazy So far I used it on my eyebrows and eyelashes, I can see the difference already!Can‚Äôt wait to use it on my hair. My hair didn‚Äôt regrow much !! Its same as it was before. I use this with coconut oil as carrier oil. It‚Äôs still not easy to spread. I also hate the smell. Been using it for a month now, my hair fall issue aggravated. ( probably not because of this oil but due to some other underlying problems which I am yet to figure out). But, This did work well for a friend‚Äôs hair fall issue. Received mine spilled all over the box. i m sure it was a great product but i didnt get to use it due to the way it was delivered. Bought for the wife for her medicinal purposes. I took it as a kid ( had no choice ) and still don't like it seventy years later. . Very good quality. I mainly use this to moisturize my hair and I have thick and kinky hair. The oil is thick so you don't need very much. A bottle can last me about 8 to 12 months. This along with basic hair mantaince has help my hair grow and keeps it looking full and healthy. Highly recommend. Haven‚Äôt had a chance to use it ...the plastic container that it came in the neck of the bottle was cracked off and almost ‚Äòdecapitated‚Äô. The oil had leaked out into the mailing package, VERY messy. Since I bought it and hate returning things, I think it‚Äôll just be used for my body. I used it for my hair once and I started seeing more shedding than before. It scared the crap out of me so I will no longer be using it for my hair. Read the bottom of the labels, discontinue if excessive hair loss, I‚Äôm tying to grow my hair not lose the little bit I have. I bought it for hair health but I didn't like it. I found it thick and sticky on my baby fine hair, I did not like the smell. If it does help with hair thickness, I guess I missed out. Easy to use and wash away As expected too oily to skin. I expected to help my itchy skin but failed. Maybe good to skin for hair but really oily and unabsorbable for skin Arrived licking and almost half is gone. I mostly used it on a section on my eyebrows that look thin. Used this every night and I'd say that It worked. Hair looks thicker now. This castor oil is really good for growing out your eyelashes and eyebrows I don‚Äôt recommend putting it on your scalp though because it makes your hair really icky and takes shampooing many times to get out the residue It‚Äôs not cold pressed, it doesn‚Äôt say that anywhere. What‚Äôs going on? To be honest, I used it once so can‚Äôt really say anything about the effectiveness and I‚Äôm ready to change my review once I see it‚Äôs working but if it‚Äôs not cold pressed than what‚Äôs the pointüòï I originally got this to help thicken my hair but it really didn't thicken my hair like I saw it it helped my hair a little bit but it didn't help thicken it up and it's very greasy and hard to move around in your hair once it's in but your hair feels great afterwards Was just what I ordered. I just started using the castor oil, but so far I like it overall. There is no scent which is fine. It‚Äôs a little on the thick side and a little sticky. I do like the price for the amount you get! This bottle will last me a long time! Unfortunately this product didn‚Äôt work for me. It left my scalp very dry and itchy. I was so hopeful this would help with my hair loss. I read a lot of reviews and some were negative and had my fingers crossed I would not have a bad reaction.  However I used it once left it on for 1 hr and when I washed my hair I lost 2-3 times as much hair. Be wary of this product doesn't work for everyone Excellent product Very effective I was expecting that it would stop hair fall but it doesn‚Äôt. It is greasy also. May be I need to mix with other oils to have better effects I had lash extensions and they ended up leaving bald spots from where my lashes were ripped out so I used this oil to help those spots grow in faster and it definitely helped, my lashes are back to normal. Also, i over tweezed my brows and this oil helped to grow out my eyebrows to the messiest they‚Äôve ever been allowing me to go get them shaped evenly. I will continue to use this for brow and longer lash growth. 3 stars because the product leaked all over! I got an oil saturated envelope. Otherwise The product seems fine. It was my first time buying so I was not sure what type of texture it should have but it had a sticky feel and I found out later from reviews that it should not feel like that. It feels like this adds an extra layer of protection in my hair! so so so so bad use for a  hair. When I used it for my hair, it didn't moisturizing. And a second day, my hair was very oil. Ok, first time to use, probably I used a worry way. So, I tried many times, it same result. So, this oil is not for a hair. Great for my skin and hair. It seems a little more loose in texture than before but overall I am Ok with the product. I really like this brand of Castro oil, I mostly use it on my hair. I gave 5 star on scent cause there isn't a scent -- as it should be.This is the finest castor oil I have ever had. I use it in my eyes (yes!) To freshen when  tired or if there's dust in them. Also helps reestablish eyelash and eyebrow growth. Excellent dry skin and foot relief. I didn‚Äôt notice any difference This product was great for the needs but however the smell was not the best and it is not the easiest to spread.  I do appreciate how soft my hairs feels after use of it. Will be purchasing again. Sent correct item fort time sent substitute second time around! Rip off! I received this product damaged the cap was loose so I cleaned it off and read the directions.. it says that you can‚Äôt use this as an everyday leave in oil for hair. You have to wash this stuff out. Very misleading advertisement the directions state that you either can leave on over night and rinse or leave on for one hour and rinse out. Very disappointed. Plus the product is so damaged I don‚Äôt trust using it anyway. SUPER THICK i find it so difficult to apply or wash off :( I have lost most of my eyebrows and lashes due to thyroid disease. After a month and a half of nightly use there has been NO improvement. It was also somewhat irritating to my eyes. Disappointed!!! very rich  makes skin look great I have really enjoyed getting to know Castor Oil from a different perspective than I had growing up in the 50's. It works great on the outside of the body, maybe even better than on the inside. It‚Äôs not pure castor oil. It‚Äôs castor oil + seed oil... I was looking for a 100% castor oil to mix with another pure oil good for hair. Smoother and softer hair after just one application. Seems like a regular oil,  it‚Äôs not like the real castor oil. No seem whatsoever and Castro oil has a smell . I can‚Äôt give a review yet. Let you know later.The only thing I can say is that they don‚Äôt put instructions how to use it on the bottle and how long you can leave it on before washing it. Was disappointed about it. Actually made my hair fall out This product is too thick. It does not spread well at all. It‚Äôs nothing but a clump of a thick substance in your hand. I absolutely hate it. I want to return it not sure f they will take it back since it‚Äôs been opened. The bottle cap arrived damaged. It leaked everywhere. I like the product but the shipping was sub par, Amazon! I just started using it so I can only comment that it moisturizes my scalp well and does not have a bad odor. It's Soooo greasy, too oily!  I use & have a lot of oils.  I was going to put it in Mascara cases I bought for me, friends & Family! Itsaid it would condition your eyelashes. I already use a product for that. Almost out so I thought I would try this!I put oils in my moisturizer,on my face & body. I was too apprehensive to put it on my face. Maybe I can mix it with a moisturizer for my body. It's just been sitting there what's the empty mascara jars. Seems like it would hit all in your eyes.My friend bought Jamaican Cator oil at Walmart and the consistency was great!  I used it for over a month while in Ireland visiting!  I will look for it!  It was AWESOME! I didn‚Äôt like it Very thick it stinks and it is not a girl black people hair unfortunately I use this product for over six months wasted my money and saw no results"
16,"Coleman Cooler Quad Portable Camping Chair, Blue",Sports and Outdoors,"I loved this chair,  but the pole broke after minimal use, I thought I was buying a more quality chair through Coleman, but that was not the case.... Could have been a little sturdier and seat a bit higher up The bag that the chair comes in is very cheap. String that is on draw string was frayed and already pulled through when I received it. I did get the chair on sale so I guess you get what you pay for. Overall the chair seems fine, just very frustrating to try to out in a cheap bag. I really like this chair however the rivets holding the nylon for the back of the chair both ripped out fairly quickly. If it wasn‚Äôt for that this would be the perfect chair. Bought in March and chair broke after very light use on July 4th. These chairs are complete garbage.  My first one broke after 2 weeks so I bought another, thinking maybe I just got a bad one.  Second chair broke the FIRST TIME I USED IT!  When you lean at all on the armrests the supports break in half and the chair becomes useless.  Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive sturdy chair because this one will just fall apart on you. Bags broke on both chairs purchased first day used them. These are very heavy to carry. Sturdy though. I've only had this chair for about two months before the metal on the arm rest bent and broke as I was getting out of it. I'll admit I am a bigger guy, but still within the chairs weight capacity, and I was dealing with a foot injury which made me have to put more weight on the arm rests to get up. The chair seems super sturdy and feels like it go hold well more than the weight capacity noted, so I was extremely surprised and very disappointed this happened. Chair broke after first use! Angry!!! As above. Returned it Last about a week and a half, the metal holding the chair together snapped. I am a bigger guy, fit well in the chair but not built for the support. Ending throwing it away when the arm rest piping snapped in half. Arrived bent and wasn't sturdy enough for the highest weight limit The arms will not stay up. From the first time I used the chair both arms, where they attached to the frame near the back, slide down making them useless. The seat was comfortable but I can't use this without the arms. Great chair but a pain to fold and get back into bag. the arm rest steel part broke unbelievable I like the built-in cooler and the width of the chair. My daughter and son play a lot of sports. Great chair for always being on the go To sit on, what did you expect,? If you do not care for a quality chair and want it for one-time use only; you should buy this chair. Taking them to daughters tennis games. These seem like they're built very well, but the arm constantly slips down, so that's kinda ah pain. They're very difficult to get into their carry bags, so most of the time, my lazy ass  carries them folded on my shoulder, vs trying to jam them into the tight bag. I'm 130lbs right now, and I feel like I could double that weight very easy on these. Easy to use, easy to clean, and keeps drinks cold without any ice in the pocket for 1-2 hours (if the drinks were in a cooler prior). Pocket is spacious enough to replace the cans with a hydroflask standing up, and the bag it comes with has a strap for easy carrying. Good for camping & kickbacks. Great chair. Comfortable. Nice cooler pouch on side. Carrying bag completely insufficient and very hard to pack up. I wish the carrying bag was larger. Coleman, how about a fix for this. I would recommend the chair for those that don't waoory about packing it back in the bag and not for those that want to pack it up easily. I really like the Coleman brand but this one has a little to desired. I bought two chairs for my husband and I to take to the Grandkids ballgames. Within the first month the bottom of bag has separated and now the drawstring has unraveled.  It has made carrying this chair a pain.  I expected more from Coleman.  I wish they would send me a new bag to carry my chair in.  The tag says there is a warranty. The price was great for 4 chairs and very easy to throw in the trunk. Comfortable. You would think these would be good chairs and last a long time with occasional use. Not so. The ""achilles heel"" of this chair is the metal arm design. When you stand up (you're sitting low because of the design), you grab the arms for support. The curved arm, from the armrest cover to just below where the seat is attached, is the weak link in this chair. It will bend and there is no way to straighten it back without the metal arm breaking. There MUST be better designed chairs out there. I liked the side cooler and the storage on the other side. Great size. Great size compartments. Poorly made with thin tubular steel.Snapped the very first time I used it when I leaned on the arm pole to support me as I got up out of the chair.Could not even return it as I had already thrown the box out. A profoundly well made chair for a great price. Very comfortable camping chair that has a number of features that are unique including a thermos/ice bag in the left arm rest a set of pockets on the right side where you can put a book /phone etc. Finally it has the usual drink holder in the right arm rest. The chair given height is easy to get in amd out of . It‚Äôs a deal plain and simple. Love it so far Really convenient, sturdy, and comfortable. Really well made. So many extras, like the arm cooler. Cost effective. My hubby is a big guy 300 plus. His caboose fits. üòä Easy to fold. Easy to carry around for my kids practice Not too much comfort the front is up it kills the back of your legs and you have to pull yourself out of the chair with the arms I can see why they break eventually ‚Ä¶. I was expecting better from Coleman Chair arm rest broke in 1 month Chair is sturdy and comfortable. It has a small built-in cooler in one arm and a pocket on the other side for phone, etc. Reasonably priced too. Didn't even last a day and the thing fell apart Chair sits to high on the front  of the legs behind the knees legs fall asleep not comfortable Seems to be good for a heavier person like myself The chairs are sturdy n comfortable n easy to pack  Love the pockets especially for cold drinks Gotta be honest, and my wife and I have had six of these over the years, I'm convinced there is a manufacturing defect in these chairs.Others have (correctly) pointed-out they're not meant to bear weight like a cane.I'm big (almost 250 pounds), and all of mine have broken at the right side joint, right below the armrest.However, my tiny wife (who weighs less than 120, and who is LEFT handed) had had two of hers break, too, in the exact same place -- the right side (even though she never applies pressure on the right). This chair is really comfortable. I love the attached cooler and pockets for storing things. The arm broke once I sat in it and I weigh under the recommended weight. I returned it, got another and it broke as well. Do not buy. This is a mixed review.  However,  let's be clear on comfort. Not. Miserable if you are under 5'6"". Don't buy it you are short. Your feet won't touch the ground, circulation beyond your knees will be nil and the bad language will start.  Is the chair sturdy? Moderately.  Heavy? Moderately.  Carry bag? Yes, but as is all too typical,  undersized so bring the silicon spray or vaseline. Cupholder?  Yes, however on the small size and fragile.  In sum, be somewhat tall, very gentle and strong with a can of WD40 or else be unhappy. We bought 2 of these ""heavy duty"" chairs and both broke at the arm in the same place!!!  Coleman is an old and trusted name and I relied on it, but it's not the Coleman of the old days.  Definitely not made in the USA.  I contacted them and after submitting lots of pictures and proofs the chairs were replaced.  Despite having to produce all the verifications the Company was easy to work with and very prompt in their replies.  But, we didn't have the use of the chairs when we needed them and since both broke in the exact same place we really don't feel that they are safe.  It was particularly disappointing because we purposely bought the sturdier version.  I would definitely not recommend buying these chairs!!!! This chair is very sturdy and comfortable.  My only complaint is the storage bag.  It is too small or the chair doesn't fold up well. Sturdy and comfortable. Lots of pockets/compartments to put phone and other items like sunglasses,  sunscreen, bug spray, drinks, and so on In love with these chair! Such a great value for this price! Have compartments and what not Carrying bag is cheap quality!  Already ripping.  Basically once you take the chair out of the bag it is a pain to get it back in the bag!  I wish it had a strap on the chair and the chair clicked and locked shut so I would just discard the bag. Bought 2 of these chairs based on the reviews and Coleman name.  During the second use, one of the pins that holds the leg into the foot molding broke.  Only had 1 use on the chair and no return option available. It is definitely a good chair. But the one I received has a right arm hangs much lower than the left. Makes for awkward relaxing These for a great price compared to most camping chairs on Amazon, me and my husband are on the fluffy side so we were looking for something that would be comfy sitting in and not having the metal sticking you all night. These are great. Plenty of room in the seat area. The side cooler is a nice feature. We like using them, doesn't leak. The mesh pockets that hang down is great to hold phones or snacks. The only complaint is the top of the chairs where they are ""sewed"" onto the metal (the pockets at the top back of the chairs) pop off really easy. So don't pick the chairs up from the back and move them around too hard. My husband is 236 lb and the chair broke within 5 months.Very disappointing Hard to fold. Hard to get into bag. Perfect chair foe camping. Compfy and easier to get in and out of See the photo. Better than most but not good. Spend the extra few bucks and get a better designed chair. Great Well built, but turned into a disappointment. The bar a room the seating part digs into the back of the legs and affects the sciatic nerve. The chair is difficult to fold, there's quite a bit of resistance when collapsing. When folded, the chair has a tendency to open back up unless you put it back into the bag. One of the back rear rivets ripped through the fabric, and finally the back support ripped through the stitching. Excellent price for a good quality, potable outdoor chair.  Great for people who are larger ‚Äî the seat is wide. this chair is horrible feels like im being squeezed to death. It broke within a month of light use. Just want a simple lightweight chair that has a cup holder and a spot to put my huge phone (iPhone 12 pro max). This was the best I could find, but would rather have a soft phone pocket over the weird ‚Äúcooler‚Äù in the chair arm. The arm rest bar broke off from the rest of the frame after a few uses. WAY too wide as well. Cheaply made metal and joints. Beware. Thought  this was the best portable chair yet until the arm broke on me, after using for only like 10 times. It would be the best of it more durable and lasted longer. Dont purchase if you weigh more than 150 pounds, the arms can't handle the weight. Had a tear/cut in the arm.  Very disappointed. Use the chair once and broke at the arm. Doesn‚Äôt breathe. We used these for two camping trips and the arms started tearing away . I got this lawns chair for my hubby‚Äôs birthday, and he always attend a Big car show and he brought this chair and put in his trunk every time. I guess he like it a lot. This chair is great. For the price, you really can't beat it. It has a small attached cooler, a large side pocket with 2 smal pockets attached and a cup holder. Folds easy, lightweight, well made and comfortable. A really nice chair but the color appears more pink than red. I don't think the animals by my campfire will mind. The carrying case ripped the second time I ever put the chair in. The chair's great. The carrying case is crap. Really sturdy and easy to assemble and setup.  Material is soft and strong.  The only downside is an odd chemical smell that is noticeable in an enclosed space like your car or garage (smells a bit like old vomit) .  I'm assuming it is an outgassing of the chemicals it was made with and will fade over time - if not I will wash them down and rinse while crossing my fingers...  Not noticeable when you are outside sitting in them. The first chair arrived with a broken connection between a leg and its foot and was quickly replaced. The second one then tore around an armrest in normal use while camping. Disappointing. I bought two of these, comfortable enough and folds easily, but one of them the arm broke off with less than 2 months of use.  The metal broke due to poor quality, not misuse.  The other one seems to work well but doubt it will last long. Great item very good I order 2 of these for myself for camping etc. after a few uses of the chair the arm rest broke off at the connection from the arm to the leg support at the rivet.  Just thought maybe it was just a manufacturing weakness so I tossed it and pulled out my second one, within a few months that chair snapped the exact same place as the previous one! Apparently this is a weak spot on these chairs and with the Coleman name on it, most people would assume these are quality made chairs. I've bought $7.00 chairs that lasted me 3 to 4 years.... These Coleman ones are definitely not worth the price you pay for them.  I would not recommend purchasing these chairs until they fix the issue with the cheap metal they use in manufacturing. It‚Äôs a good chair, but it wasn‚Äôt made correctly. There is a rivet missing where one of the leg poles goes into the plastic foot. It pops out every time I open it up and it makes it harder to use. Works well by the campfire It's sturdy and I love it Maybe I had higher expectations of Coleman products. The chairs are comfortable enough but nothing fantastic other than a place to sit when you're tired of standing. I do like the compartments these have. I've had these chairs for 2 months and have only used them on a few outings. The bottom of the carrier bag is already ripping and I don't trust it to hold much longer if I have to sling this chair over my shoulder and cart it any length or distance. The arm fastener that keeps it secured to the metal broke after about 3 uses and now regularly falls off so you can't let your right arm get to comfortable or you'll end up falling off the edge of the chair. My husband and I are average size, on the healthier side of average, so our body weight isn't to blame for the quick ware and tear. I'd recommend you find a better product. I'm already shopping for different chairs. Pricey but sturdy Love this chair. We now have two, and the first one we‚Äôve been using for years. i expected something more sturdy.  i prefer canvas to the synthetic fabric.  the chair is too large and offers little back support. This chair broke the second time an adult within the weight allotment for the chair used it. It‚Äôs arm collapsed and broke along with a leg causing the chair to collapse while she was sitting in it. Thus injuring her knee. I got this because of Wirecutter review. It is wider and a little more comfortable than most chairs like this, but it's not all that much better. The padding doesn't do much because you're suspended... probably just makes the chair hotter to sit in. The back looks like it'd be higher than other chairs, but I am 5'5"" and I cannot rest my head on it at all. Everything seems sturdy and well-made. The pockets are nice, again not too different from other chairs. The carrying bag is very flimsy but I'm not holding that against it..Overall I like that it is roomier but the construction quality and design details don't stand out much. Will update with problems. I had an older chair of the same type, this one has a good high back. I like the side pocket for your phone, book or tablet. And we shall see later about the cooler pocket :) Cheap chair for the price. Not what I expected from this brand. Could have bought an Ozark Trail one for less than a third of the price and the same quality. Nice chair with storage These are big chairs but sturdy. They are great for car camping and pack down relatively well. We like all of the pockets for things like drinks, phones, maps, headlamps, etc. would recommend. I sat in this chair three times before the armrest bar broke in half where the hole was drilled for the pin. I‚Äôm not more than 215 lbs on a bad day. Unfortunately that also means the seat won‚Äôt hold up since they‚Äôre attached to the same joint.I liked the zipper closure on the arm rest, but that doesn‚Äôt help me much now! Love the product My chair broke the first time I took it camping.. what a bummer! I really loved this chair right up until the point the arm twisted off.. which is unfortunate. I take care of my equipment, and might be pushing 250, but I bought a chair with that in mind, well tuned the rating of 325lbs. No Great chair - bought 2. Very sturdy and comfortable. Does not like the sun at all.  Leave it out for a month and it's toast and will tear. I really really wanted to love this thing and trust me at first this thing actually felt amazing to sit in at first however this thing broke within two months what a joke‚Ä¶thing is when I wanted a replacement I noticed i had to send the seat back yet i tossed the thing not to mention how am I supposed to ship such a large item back without a box?Update: Coleman made things right however it was hit or miss there for a bit with the warranty dept. After 3+ months I broke the arm while getting up. I'm 290lb.But I love this chair, cup holder cooler pocket and other pockets. Light and easy to carry.I'm getting another one. Bought for my personal use. I have back problems and it was easy to get up from. I love this chair. It is very comfortable. I also love that it has a cooler bag on the side, pockets, and a cup holder. Great purchase all around. I love the feel of the chair. These chairs work for what I needed The chair is very comfortable and sturdy. I‚Äôm considering cutting off the extras on the arms. They make it quite difficult to get it back in the carry case. The first time I used this chair it ripped in a critical location (one of the arm slots that holds it all together).  I weigh about 150lbs.  Seems like this chair might be best advertised as a disposable chair.  It is a shame as it is very comfortable if a bit heavy.  I would avoid. its good for picnic easy to pull out For most people this chair would be fine. Myself having medical problems it sits to low and is hard to get out of. Perfect for my son who liked stealing our chairs It looked like it had been used when I received it. The neighborhood cat loves exploring and scratching and rubbing all over this chair.  Whether it will survive the claws is, at the moment, a very open question.Since we bought this only for use outdoors (and not for transporting elsewhere), the ease of getting it into and out of the carry case is not a big deal. So far, the couple of times we've done it, it was no more difficult than stuffing a big umbrella into its case.The 3-star rating reflects the fact that we've used the chair only a few times since we bought it and never for more than an hour at time (during which it has been quite comfortable).  Otherwise, it would rate a 4, maybe even a 5.  At the moment, we are quite pleased with it. After short usage a cheap fastener holding a leg in the base broke.  I drilled it out and replaced with small bolt and it seems to be holding. Very comfortable and sturdy. Used it for our recent camping trip, didn't take up a ton of space. Easy to setup and disassemble. Easy choice Chair worked well at first but after about a month of fair use(I am a 180lb man muscular but not heavy by any means really) the left arm of the chair detached from the metal socket it was on and broke so now the arm is hanging from the back of the chair. I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend this product if you care about quality We bought two of these as we are frequent campers. Within one use the arms came unstitched from where they were attached to the chair. Makes it difficult to use and repack. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Fell apart after about 10 minutes. All the rivets failed holding the fabric to the frame. I compared this chair to a real Colman. This chair is counterfeited. fine No durability. Very comfortable but does not hold up well. First one I got ripped at seams in a couple of days.  Got a replacement. Same problem plus because of design it is difficult to get out of  There is nothing to push down on to get out and if you press at all on the front of armrests they bend.  Sending this one back and getting a refund if I can. Great chair while it lasted. Nice big pockets and great cup holders. Unfortunately the metal supports came apart within a month and the chair collapsed with me in it. We love these chairs The armrest just snapped clean off while sitting. There were no sudden movements. Bought four of these because they were cheapest. One tore through after it had been sat in four times by nobody over 150lbs. By my math, that's not worth the money. Buy a better one, y'all, for a few bucks more so you can use it as long as you expect to. I give this chair two thumbs up. I‚Äôm a 200 pound mom and it holds me and my son. I use it 4x a week for my daughter‚Äôs practice and games and it‚Äôs been great. I haven‚Äôt had any problems and it‚Äôs super durable. Not as sturdy as I thought and therefore not as easy to get out of This product is an embarrassment. Horrible construction quality, the arms have no support and just slouch down the tube. Some of the worst stitching I've ever seen, with rough edges everywhere. If I were given this chair for free I wouldn't even bother bringing it home.This is total trash, spend more money or get the same exact thing at Walmart for $10. The only upside is that the return was easy. When they say oversized, they really mean oversized. A lot bigger than normal one of these, which makes it pretty roomy and comfortable to sit on, but less convenient to carry around. If I could put 0 stars I would.I purchased in February and just opened it to use it because it just got nice out and there is a plastic peice broke off and the bag and chair are ripped. I'm very unhappy.It doesn't help at this point that I cant speak to anybody in amazon customer service due to the virus so I'm stuck with a $25 broken chair. There is no strap to keep it closed. The bag only fits 3/4 of the chair. But it is a solid chair. This is a comfortable chair with plenty of room for people much bigger than me.  The cold container is great to have.  The chair is sturdy and will last a long time.  BUT... the carry case doesn't make the grade.  It tore the second time I used the chair, and the chair just barely fits.  I would have tossed, but I often carry the chair a distance, and without the cover it is very clumsy. Comfortable, East to fold and when I say in it was sturdy. Great chairs, my husband is 6‚Äô4‚Äù and the standard ones are too small for him to sit comfortably in, these ones are way better for him. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and I can sit comfortably in these without feeling like I‚Äôm being swallowed by it. Will be buying more for the rest of the family as well Not a comfy/fitting chair, if your taller than 5'8"" I would say this chair is not good for you.  My arms hang off the arm rest and the back makes you practice good posture.  It's not padded but duel canvased, its sturdy and can hold a 6' 350ib man.  I would say this is a good teen/kid chair but would not recommend it for adults.  the stow bags feel very thin and probably will ripe on you later when putting them away. I'm not super upset about the brown back, but it was interesting to order Gray/Black chairs and have them show up in brown bags with a brown back. That might matter to some folks.These chairs are super sturdy and you can tell they're made with materials that are substantially better than the ones that look identical but cost half the price. Seems like it will be worth it.They are kind of a pain to fold. As usual, the bag could be 10% larger, especially with the giant cooler bag in one of the arms.Still, I'd buy again. I'm looking for camp chairs to use during summer gatherings. These won't do. First the arm rests are different heights. Second although there isn't a bar under the front of the seat it feels like it while seated. I think these chairs would be fine for a short time but not for a 2 hour outdoor movie. The chair arrived with a broken screw so one leg was not attached to the support. My husband drilled a new hole and attached the foot support to the leg. It works fine now. For the price, it has some good features. The seat is a little ""saggy"" for my taste but appreciate the higher back. We sell crafts at farmer's markets so this is light weight seating with great features like an armside cooler and side sling for magazines, books, kindle, phone, etc. Chair arm broke after two uses. Unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt occur within the return window so I‚Äôm stuck with a broken chair and wasted money. I have only had the hair for 6 weeks and it is already broken.  I would not recommend it to anyone It was a gift I don't know if the person liked it or not This product has a major flaw, the arm rests slide down with the slightest amount of weight making them completely useless.  You couldn't rest your elbows on them to read a book without them sliding down.  Basically makes this an armless chair. We got two of them and they were both the same.  Returning them.  Also, the back is high but unsupported so you can rest your head back.  It makes no sense.  The pockets and cooler were cool but as a chair it failed. The bag it comes in is not high quality but it worked. It broke within a week...Cannot be used...very sad I found it impossible to fit the chair back in the bag. I returned the chair. It was a high quality chair but was not practical for my use. Chair was bought to take to grandson‚Äôs ball games. I would have been the last one to leave the park trying to carry a bag chair that wouldn‚Äôt fit back in the bag. Overall not a bad chair. But for the price I expected a bit better. The elbow rests will not stop slipping. I know you can duct tape some pool noodles on there but it shouldn‚Äôt be up to the consumer to fix a design flaw. Especially on a well known brand like Coleman. Manufacturer just needs to put a few notches on pole so the ring could catch on to adjust the elbow height.  Also the chair arrived with numerous loose threads. Makes me wonder about the longevity of this. Not sure about the attached cooler either. With ice might hold a couple beers I guess. I‚Äôll just use it to keep my wallet and keys clean. Overall, pretty average chair. Comfortable and holds a couple of drinks. Seems sturdy. Came missing two screws on the legs, so the poles just slip out all the time and you have to re-seat them. The fabric began tearing after a few months of use. Cheaply made garbage. I like the diverse functionality of this chair. However, the reason for getting an oversized chair is I was tired of the legs of the chair digging into the back of my legs. This chair isn‚Äôt as bad as my previous chairs but I do wish it was more comfy. Love love love this chair! Not only does it fold up easily and store in a carrying case but it also has pockets and a small build in cooler. This chair has a wide seat which supports my plus size figure with no worries of breaking bending or shifting while I‚Äôm getting in or out of it. Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a while."
17,Coleman Sundome Tent,Sports and Outdoors,"Easy to set up - I set it up by myself so granted it took longer than 10 minutes but no rods broke and it held upI got the 4 person tent which is very spacious - perfect for a couple and a dog or three people- 4 people may be a little tightvery happy with purchase- exactly as expected This product is ok, but what would make it an EXCELLENT product is if Amazon would pay its workers a livable wage in every part of the world and stop supporting the CCP in their quest to eradicate Hong Kong's democracy. Loved it. Zippers don't stick. Light rain, we stayed dry. High winds, cozy inside. I bought two tents. Why?, two people sleep cozy with room for a backpack. Their is four of us. You can fit 3 140lb people in one tent, just don't move. But I like leg room. The vents keeps tent cool on hot days. Strap downs are good. The ground was so hard, I used rocks to tie the straps down. The pegs are cheap, buy good ones. A pole broke the first time we set this up.  Coleman was not very responsive.  When they did respond, they said to return it to Amazon because it was within the return period.  It wasn't Amazon's fault the pole broke, so we chose not to take that route.  The tent is a nice size, but will likely only be a good fit for warm weather camping.  This is not a quality item nor does it live up to the Coleman name.  We could have gotten the same quality in a cheap box-store brand tent - disappointed! The string was frayed and broke in one of the main rods at second use. Mind that the first ""use"" was just to practice putting it up and taking it down for a big event I attended 2 days later. Needless to say it was a disaster. This item is great, the tent and everything all sets up great but when we opened it and put it together the item had clearly been used. It smells like camp fire and had dirt, wrappers, and receipts inside the tent. My husband had to vacuum it out and let it air out a bit. The item was new, not an Amazon Marketplace item so I feel pretty frustrated that it wasn‚Äôt in new condition. Other than that the tent is great. Very lightweight. Too bright for me, was super bright in the morning One of the two tent poles arrived a section too short, rendering the whole tent useless. It won‚Äôt stand on its own. It's a great tent. I set it up in Central Texas in January and lived in it every Friday through Sunday/Monday til March. Withstood storms, torrential downpours and high winds. Obviously it doesn't help against the cold, though. Heats up really easily.Throw a tarp over for bad weather and/or use waterproofing spray and this tent will serve you well!I got the 4 person and could fit a twin air mattress plus 3 bags, a large staff and food/drinks in it still with room to sit and chill and change in the mornings. Great purchase.  Very affordable yet durable Missing one of the rods for the water proof screen.Have to go to Walmart to buy a replacement as we have a camping trip in 2 days. Seems like a good tent sadly we won‚Äôt know. I bought this tent Amazon Lightning deal I really wasn't looking to buy a tent but it was a great price. Happy I purchase this tent lots of room and you can stand up in the tent easily. I use this tent for a week with three people and gear we had plenty of room. This is a typical Coleman tent easy setup sense we took down and moved everyday for 7 days. Great quality I didnt actually get to test this tent in the rain, but have never had issues with Coleman tents in the past.  The only negative I saw is that the door is half nylon, half screen, so ventilation is not the best.  However, this is a budget tent, so you should not expect every feature of more expensive tents.  Bottom line, does the job for the money. Good tent for the price.  It rained on us one night and water came in through a couple areas.  It's mostly as the rain was sideways and the rain fly doesn't go as low as needed to keep that kind of rain out. My first tent came with a bad zipper and a hole in the rear window.  I kindly asked for a replacement.  Amazon, however, sent me a tarp that a tent sits on.  When I called, the rep tried to refund me.  I tried over and over to tell her that Amazon sent the wrong replacement.  Normally, I would have taken the refund and moved on, but the price of the tent went up an additional $20 since I purchased it.  I did not feel I should have to pay more.  We will see if Amazon can get it right the 3rd time.The tent did seem okay, but one thing that bothered me was the packaging was way too small to store the tent in once it was removed.  Overall, the tent is just okay.  I am not impressed by the quality or by Amazon's horrible customer service.  I would not purchase this tent again. Did a trial run to put the tent up before going camping, set-up easy quick. Taking tent down the elastic rope snapped inside the poles!! Now calling as paper says do not return product until calling this number.....not happy!! Not a good tent, I bought it in June 2019 didn't  use it until August on a two week camping trip, the zipper came apart, wouldn't stay closed, now I can't return it, time limits up,it's cheaply  made, so I'm  stuck with it. They have your money, they don't care. Overall the tent design is nice. It has the basic features of a modern tent, with the more tarp like bottom of car tents. Unfortunately, the seam of the tarp-bottom and the polyester tent leak. It is interesting that it does not appear to leak everywhere, but instead only on the corner with the port for power cables. I tested this a few different ways to confirm it was the seam and not the port. Furthermore I ordered a second tent to see if mine was  faulty, and both have the same flaw. I will be returning both and shopping around for another brand, probably from REI which tends to stock better gear (though I was hoping for a cheap tent that didn't leak and I wouldn't have to worry about getting damaged at festival and other lighter trips/events) Tent is a nice tent, but bought it new and received a used on that had kid toys, and Oreos inside.missing parts for the top sunshade part. Didn't look untill I set it up at the camp site. Not happy at all We took this out to use it and discovered only when we went to set it up that one pole was broken.  A disaster given we packed it with us to use and it was brand new. it is an ok tent, but not a great one. A pole broke on my 3rd time using it and it is a bit cramped for 2 people. Very disappointed with this tent. Replaced an old Coleman tent with this new one. As with any family that camps, we have a ton of Coleman products; stove, bbq, tents, flashlights, lanterns, coolers, etc. Most have been solid products that last. This new tent simply will not last.Easy to set up. And clear from the instant you feel the material, the quality has gone down. Thinner and feels as if it will easily rip. There is a weather flap covering the main door‚Äôs zipper which is impossible not to snag every time you close the zipper. No joke, it gets stuck on the material every single time we open or close the tent. There is an air vent near the floor which doesn‚Äôt close, always open. Makes no sense. And lastly, there are two internal mesh pockets for your gear. One ripped first day we used the tent.Won‚Äôt deter me from purchasing other Coleman products, but done with their tents. This size of this tent was perfect, we had a queen size blow up bed inside, also had 3 sleeping bags, It slept 5 of us comfortably.  Installation didn't take long and there weren't a lot of steps to set it up. Easy to set up, room for queen and twin air mattress and gear. Came with small tear in mesh at the top center, not good but doesn't impact structure. The tent was easy to set up, but I only used it once (camping on dirt) and now there is a pretty big hole on the bottom. So I bought this for a camping trip this summer up by the coast. It was fine during the day but at night the wind blew right in and cold seeped into this tent. I was sleeping with a lot of blankets, a big comforter, flannel sheets and another person on a tall air matress elevated from the ground and it was still freezing. Would only recommend for any place that doesn‚Äôt get below 60 at night. I didn‚Äôt realize when I bought the tent that the big ‚Äú mesh windows‚Äù were always windows. As in there is no zipper flap to cover the mesh with a more solid fabric so they are always open, which also means without the rain fly you would have no privacy. It didn‚Äôt really rain while we were camping but it did get moist on a few of the days and the rain fly did keep the water out. It does say in the description that it‚Äôs good for warm weather but also makes it sound like it can withstand some mildly cold weather by stating that it can withstand winds and rain and I feel like a paid a lot for a tent that is neither that big nor good for any weather that isn‚Äôt 70 or above. Damaged, had to return it. Everything is great quality! Better equipped for a party of two with room for bags and supplies rather than four which fits snug! This is a nice tent, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I just don‚Äôt like the fact I have to rely on the cover to keep sunlight out, and I can‚Äôt zip down all flaps. It‚Äôs pretty roomy, and relatively easily to put up‚Ä¶.but I‚Äôm not too impressed with the size for the price. Also, it does seem like it‚Äôs a little on the cheap side-the feel of the materials and how sturdy it is. My fianc√© have taken our new tent camping and have absolutely loved it! We stayed comfortable and had privacy. We are going on a camping trip very soon, and the only thing we have tent-wise is a monstrous 8-person apparatus that is >10 years old... We were concerned about the water-tight nature of the tent, so we decided that maybe it was time to look for something new.This tent comes in three pieces of water impervious fabric. The fabric is VERY thin, but this likely helps a lot in terms of weight. The instructions are sewn to the bag, and are water resistant as well, which is a very nice touch.While putting this together was pretty easy once we realized what the heck we were supposed to do, the instructions didn't have enough instruction, enough photos, and worst of all seemed kind of incomplete. For example, there's a rectangular piece that is not referenced at all in the instructions, so our honest guess is that this is for our shoes to take off at night to not get the inside of the tent dirty? This is a total guess, though.The poles were extremely night because they have a string in the middle that are taught that snaps the poles together quickly and easily. The tent looks great once it's up, however it definitely isn't going to win any awards for sturdiness - a few good winds I anticipate having to buy a new tent in the end.We're hoping for good weather so none of this matters, but it's just something to think about during your purchase. Got this this week. Quick delivery, easy to assemble, easy to put back for storage.  Just tried it indoor so i can't rate as such. will update review once used outdoors. overall, it's a good buy We have a queen air mattress and there's two of us- this tent fits that and our back packs and that is it- no way is this a 4- adult tent- maybe 4 very small adults with no gear. decent tent but smaller than we wanted . I Called Colmann for replacment.What a pain!!!!!!Waste of 35Bucks. Not easy to repack it Bought two of these for my 5 member family. It does the job IF RAIN IS OUT OF YOUR PLANS. These are not waterproof nor Water Resistant. Of course, those kind of tents are over $800. These are good , almost perfect. You will see condensation when you wake up in a winter season. We are happy with these. Ok. So I do not know a single thing about camping using tents . I've done It before, but was not involved in set ups. I was extremely disappointed at how we got rained on. I love the simplicity of this design, but we got some of our items wet (thankfully they were waterpoof) and I ended up started to take down the tent at 4am (having to wake my kids up) since it was only a matter of time before everything got wet. Again, I know nothing on set up. I didn't do any fancy /tent hacks and what have you to ensure anything cause I know zero on camping, but feel like even so, this tent, with the fly, should've prevented water from coming in. I want to return, but beyond the water issue, I really liked this tent. But the water issue was an absolute necessity, so I am disappointed. It‚Äôs easy to assemble and great quality !!! I was pretty excited about this tent.  Super easy to set up and take down, very roomy, great ventilation and it performed well for two nights of heavy rain.  The third night we had some wind and tied down the stakes.  The tent didn't blow over but one of the tent poles snapped.  Disappointed that the tent didn't even make it three nights.  Not recommended. Super easy to put together! Coleman is the only brand I will buy a tent from, super durable , wind proof rain proof and love that it comes with two extra stakes! It's nice, compact and light weight tent for it's size. It's waterproof and didn't got any issues while camping in rain. Very easy to setup. I'm give 4 instead of 5 star as entry place of tent is having very small shading to prevent rain to get in while using it during rain and also due to small shading can't leave footwear outside when it's raining. Used this four person tent for  the first time this cool - rainy weekend.  Rained hard multiple times and no leaks!  Easy to put together and take apart.  However, listed as a four person tent.  I slept in it by myself on a cot and there was very little space remaining. Good tent for the price. Did the job. Put it back in the bag too awhile tho Tent ripped in 2 different spots on the seam when I used it the first time. Never had a problem with any Coleman tent before. Also, the zipper is very flimsy, it came off the track when I tried to unzip the door.Best thing about the tent is easy setup and water resistant...it poured the night I camped unexpectedly. Inexpensive and easy to set up. Best suited for summer months. Can‚Äôt beat 10x10 ft for $100! This is the first tent I've ever owned.  I went with something cheaper because I didn't know if I'd like this whole camping thing being a city dweller. The tent was easy enough to set up, I did a test run in my living room before heading into the woods.  When it was set up I noticed the stitching wasn't very straight so I bought seam sealer just incase and tried to seal the bottom seams.  While on our trip it rained for maybe an hour, and in that hour we were dealing with rain leaking in to the tent at most the seams (even one of the seams I attempted to seal) and from the rainfly.  I was able to run jump out into the rain and get a poncho over the rainfly which stopped most of that leaking, and put duct tape on the seams to aid in the other leaking areas.  If it weren't for the leaking this tent was big enough for 2 adults and 2 dogs (husky and lab mix for size reference). I would give this 0 stars if possible. Doesn‚Äôt even keep mosquitos out! Worst night camping I‚Äôve ever had covered head to toe in bites and mosquitos everywhere inside all night long My son wanted his own tent. He never camped before, being 12, I let him in the backyard over the weekend. Of course, it rained and he was soaked. I'll just have to buy some waterproofing spray ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but he was excited on how easy it was to put up. Hard to assemble  rain cover. Directions  very confusing Never said they fixed it with duct tape, which left it even worse For the size of a tent that it was it was easy for one person to set it up and tear it down. I was very happy with the quality of the stitching and zipper. No issues recommending it Used this tent twice. Once in the backyard and Once at an actual campground. I'm super bummed because this tent got a rip in it very easily. The rip is perfectly slit about 8 inches long. I am not sure if there was a weak spot in the fabric or what but I am very upset with this product because it wasn't my fault. Great looking tent and even more amazing company, Coleman. This tent was not square so it made it very difficult to set up. The door zipper got stuck many times being not square contributing to it‚Äôs failure. The tent failed with the wind too. We experienced a steady 10-15 mph winds with gusts up to 25. With the mesh 1/2 of width of each side and the rain fly cover had the cold wind coming in with ease. It got down to 46 degrees and this tent did not provide much shelter from the elements. Small hole when arrived but kept it because we were going camping the next day. Did not know it had a hole until it started raining for two straight days. Never went camping again and it sits in the basement Its not meant for people over 5 feet tall. More like kid tent  the threshold was high too kept thinking the rain fly was going to poke my eyes out To small A lovely little tent for casual car camping. Survived two days in pretty torrential rain with minimal seepage. This is a great starter tent. Big enough for 2 comfortably.  or 1 with room to spread out and store gear. Just a bit small The pole that connects the front and back of the topper broke after the first use. The string on the inside snapped while taking the tent down. I haven‚Äôt even had the tent a week. Super disappointed. Hopefully the strings in the poles that hold the tent up will hold up longer. Easy up, and not too bad taking it down. It has a spot just above the door outside to hang a your lightweight electric lantern when you need to set it somewhere to open the tent door, and the zipper is sturdy and somewhat easier to manage than many tents. Excellent privacy when you zip the windows shut with no weird open spots that you have to crouch under to change your clothes. It has JUST enough room to fit a queen air mattress with very little room left on the sides, so leave your other stuff in the car or use it by yourself with one twin mattress. But its winning characteristic‚Ä¶ it survived some truly thrashing thunderstorms in the mountains and remained 100% sturdy and completely bone dry, so for this reason Coleman tents have my undying loyalty for life. The elastic cord inside the support rod broke. We bought this tent and immediately went camping the next weekend. The setup was easy and tent interior was fine.  Our problem came when we were taking the tent down and the elastic in both set of poles snapped.  These poles can be used without the elastic, but it is certainly more convenient to have the poles linked.  I was a little frustrated to have the product break so soon after purchase but I figured I would at least try contacting customer service to see what could be done.  I received no reply for a week and when I did they asked for my tent model and said they would sent new poles.  Several days later I received three tent pole repair kits for a different tent model than mine.  I was able to use the elastic out of the kits to repair my poles, but it was a bit of a hassle.  Now I have three kits full of poles and pieces that don't match my tent.In conclusion, it's concerning that my tent poles would break after one use.  It was also concerning that instead of sending me new poles (or just elastic band) I got the wrong kits.  This is a cheap tent, so I was expecting some long term quality issues, I just figured it wouldn't be a problem so soon.  If I was to do it again I would probably just spend more and get a better tent. Disgusting!  Inside the tent were someone‚Äôs dirty under shorts. Door zipper broken and parts not working!!  Horrible horrible experience! It was supposed to hold a queen size air mattress. However I bought a full and we could barely get it into the tent!Otherwise it was pretty good. It‚Äôs got lots of the ventilation and very good quality. However, when we woke up in the morning, some condensation dripped through the screen that accumulated between the tent and the top cover. Other than that, it is very light weight, easy to assemble good quality tent. Major manufacturing defect After first use there's a small tear at the top where the poles go through. The tent looks sturdy and weatherproof.It came with instruction & all of the pierces, if you want to bypass reading you can watch a YouTube video on how to assemble. I bought the 7'x7' 3 person tent hoping it can fit me alone (6'1''). I measured the widest part at the floor an it is not 7 feet but is about 6 feet 6 inches, 6'7'' at most. When I lay parallel to a wall I touch simultaneously both walls with my feet and my top because at ~1 foot height it's about 6'. Good part that I fit after all with no space left and I can lay diagonally :-) It is not too hard to assemble but easy to do many mistakes while assembling. Works like a charm, easy to put up and easy to take down Walls of mesh This tent is amazing but it is small. A grown man probably cannot fit in the tent comfortably but it is lightweight, easily constructed, and appealing to the eye. I recommend this tent to the shorter people who aren't claustrophobic! Took this bad boy camping in the mountains. It was rainy, windy, and frosty (cold). This tent held up great. There was plenty of room for my partner and I. Lots of room to fit a queen sized air mattress and your bags full of essentials. A king sized air mattress would definitely fit. This is an awesome tent that will last. I'm pissed that the size is incorrectly stated. Description on bullet points says: 10 ft. x 10 ft.floor fits two queen size airbeds.  A queen airbed dimensions are 60""x80"" so two WILL NOT FIT!!!  I spent hours searching for a new tent and comparing things like size, how many windows, etc. Once it was set up it barely fit one queen airbed with 2 people. There is also not enough room on the side of the airbed to stand up straight even tho the size says 6'.  (I'm 5'8""). We easily assembled the tent within 10 minutes using the hardware provided. There are two primary poles and a third for the rain fly. The tent will hold two twin Intex brand air mattresses (really thin) and a few belongings. The tent developed a 3 inch separation at the base seam on the second night of our trip. We had plenty of bugs but managed to stay dry. I'm a novice camper and consider this a light duty tent. The zipper on this tent did not hold up past a couple of camping seasons.  Coleman seems to have problems with the zipper in their tents.  We had another cabin tent that lasted only one season before the zipper would keep splitting.  The zipper in this tent did last a bit longer but is also splitting regularly.  It is too bad, because this tent is perfect for scouting.  It is easy to set up and seems to hold up to weather (rain) well.  My son has the four person size and could easily set it up by himself at age 10 or so.  The 4 person tent is the perfect size for two people with room to store their gear out of the elements. Loved the easy set-up and held up well in rain. Good tent. Fits a queen size air bed length-wise. Good air flow for warmer nights. Not great during cold nights. I do love the tent. I only went 4 stars because one tent pole was broken on delivery, and even though the tent is ""under warranty"" Coleman warranty department did not respond to calls or emails. Fortunately with a bit of research I was able to fix it for $5. We needed an extra tent for my daughter and her husband for our camping trip. I bought this tent because the description and measurements listed said it was a 4 person tent and seemed that it would be big enough. The description also said it would fit a queen size air mattress. This is NOT a 4 person tent! 4 children may fit in it but not 4 adults. Once we put in the queen mattress it took the entire floor space and there was no room to walk around it nor to put a fan in there. You had to climb in to the bed from the door opening and crawl across the bed to lay down. We are average size (everyone is under 6ft) and you can't stand up in the tent. They only slept in it one night because they couldn't put in a fan and it was too hot. If you want a little tent for youths or teens with bed rolls this is fine. It didn't rain so I can't say if it was weather proof/water tight. It was easy to put up and take down. Wish I hadn't bought it as I have no use for it. This is not a comfortable two person tent. Myself and two small dogs were cramped. Easy setup. Good ventilation. Good size for double mattress and gear. Did not like it at all, whimsy and not durabla as advertised. Also impossible to reach the seller, if you ever need to contact them Have been using Coleman tents for years. I camped across America with this one this year. This dome tent is a good size and easy to put up, except for the rain fly which proved weird (compared to other tents) and difficult. It was pretty good in good weather and kept me warm when it was cold and cool enough when hot. It rained a couple times and water DID get into the tent, but only very little. This is probably because the rain fly doesn't go down very far and water blew into the tent. It did repel water. Biggest issue was the tent rain fly pole which came unstrung even though I treated it with care. Will try to get a replacement from Coleman and will update review. As for wind, it was comparable to other cheaper Coleman dome tents and did okay with 20 mph wind. Looked great, very roomy. That‚Äôs about it. Used six times. The zipper constantly catches the doorway flap even when being careful. Third time out zipper tore a hole. 5th time out the elastic in the doorway stick broke. Went out the last time and the elastic in the main support just snapped putting up. Less than a summer of camping. Invest in something nicer. First time we brought it out to go camping it poured. We stayed nice and dry. Good size and value for the money. I've come to expect a lot of Coleman products - I own a butane stove, a sleeping bag, another Coleman tent, and probably more. Frankly, this tent is pretty nice. It's roomy for a 2-person tent, it resists the weather well, it packs small and carries light. There is, however, one glaring issue which renders the product nigh unusable - the poles.After just 3 outings and an admittedly clumsy move on my part, just a bit of weight snapped one of the poles irreparably. Huge bummer. This is a waste of money. Absolute crap and false advertising. This was described as a 10 by 10ft 3 season tent. What I received is a 7 by 9ft flimsy piece of garbage. If you want something that will rip shortly after buying get this tent. Otherwise don't waste your money. Bought in April, first time use in the north woods of Wisconsin. Started setting up tent and found it had numerous holes in the mesh netting. obviously I got a defective tent. luckily I brought duct tape or probably would've been eatin alive by the mosquitos. Will update if they take care of their defective tent. no way you can fit 4 people in here. can barely fit 2 all went well We use this for two people on weekends camp trips. This is a great tent that is lightweight, easy to set up (10 minutes), and does a great job keeping you dry in the rain.  My only wish is that it had another door on the side, but all things considered, that's minor.  Very happy with the tent This is a good tent for the money. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna backpack too often with it, probably. As in never. For campsites in state parks; perfect. Really good tent for this money, very easy to open and very good for summer camp. It's great product. Warehouse deal arrived with no poles.  Return was easy.  Purchased a blue replacement that was perfect. Finally setting this tent up for the first time out of the box. There is a short 2 inch ‚Äúrun‚Äù in the floor material where it looks like it was grazed by something sharp that damaged the tarp-like fabric. It‚Äôs tiny, but enough to let water in or maybe some tiny bugs in like ticks or chiggers. So I am not super happy about that. I‚Äôll need to find a way to patch it as I don‚Äôt want to deal with shipping this thing back. The tent was decent. Set up was fairly easy. But the tent was used when we opened it. It had sand inside it and it‚Äôs definitely worn. Disappointed that my kids saved and all pitched in and got sent a used tent. Went camping for the first time ever, it was an easy fix, I arrived late at night luckily I was able to do car side camping and hold my flashlights on the hood while my hands were busy assembling, you do need 2 people to get this up. You'll save some time. However this DOES NOT FIT 2 PEOPLE this is fine if you have small kids, I'm 5 foot 11 with my air mattress stuff barley fit inside if I moved a bit I was at the edge of either part of the tent. I kept my shower bag and my clothes on the surface at the sides but it was cramped. Won't be going with this tent again. I've been advised to try the pop-up style tents instead It was plenty of room. It did rain the night we used it, and it's definitely water resistant. We really love it! First storm and this tent is leaking everywhere. Not happy. 10mph winds at best. I got this tent 5 weeks ago and just used it. I noticed on my second use that there were holes already in multiple places in the mesh! I don‚Äôt know why but I don‚Äôt think it should be deteriorating this quickly. I‚Äôm just a couple days outside my return window, so I‚Äôm going to see if I can contact the seller. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed since Coleman is the brand. I know it wasn‚Äôt crazy expensive but it wasn‚Äôt free either and quite a lot cheaper at Walmart for what I assume can‚Äôt be worse quality. This is my beginner tent, it is pretty roomy and got for starting! I'm camping on an island off the coast of Maine for the Summer, I arrived the first week of June and won't be picked up until October. Every time it rains everything ends up wet....I've never been so disappointed in a Coleman product. I purchased this exact same model tent 2 yrs. Ago and loved it, it was fabulous, no problems at all. So, I thought, I'll buy a brand-new one for this extended camping trip, trusting it would be the same high quality as my first one. Seriously disappointed Coleman...I've got mildew problems to tend with because, your tent leaks and doesn't repel the water it saturates instead. Good tent, nice and roomy and tall. Easy assembly. Disappointed that the door zipper isn't slightly more heavy duty though. Half if it broke on the first day of use. Rain fly barely covers all the openings. It‚Äôs very windy inside if it‚Äôs windy outside. Did well with a light rain. Don‚Äôt imagine it would do so well if it were any harder of a rain. Center should have a hook or bag to hold a light but it doesn‚Äôt. The air vent doesn‚Äôt have any way to stay open but the rest is so open it doesn‚Äôt really matter anyway. The bag it comes in has a rip away ribbon to make it bigger. That was thoughtful, as one can never really get it rolled back up as tightly as the original packaging. In short is an okay tent. If I were to be out in weather lower than 40 degrees or during a storm I would not use this tent. It‚Äôs nice and big for the purpose of fitting my daughter‚Äôs pack n play inside along with all our gear and space to sleep. Once she is able to sleep on the ground with a blanket with the adults we will be looking for a better smaller tent. And will use this as a place to hangout in the day. Or for storing our food. The light barely lit a reading area in my tent in pitch black night. The fan made a nice hum noise to let me know it was working, but didnt move any air. Has a 3 inch rip bottom of doorway on a seam looks like it came from the factory that way. There is no way to close the windows, so useless during cold windy times. It takes lot more than 10 min to assemble this thing. The tent makers always lie about how fast it is to assemble.The instructions are miserable Tent bag zipper broke the FIRST time my son took is camping with the scouts as he tried to bag the tent and zip the bag shut.  Now he never wants to use his tent since the bag is broken- Looking for a tent to buy for the camping adventures and well, just in case scenarios..Came with all you need, except for the tent stakes as they seem weak and might break when hitting in hard areas. I would recommend getting sturdier stakes. Easy to set up and break down. Big enough inside to use a queen blow up mattress, as we did with just enough room for other smaller thing inside the tent. Comes with 2 mesh pockets hanging on each ends for smaller storage items. Also 2 sides of the tent have available areas to open up for a screened window and ventilation.  The one thing that bugged me was the zipper for the door kept on snagging on the cover valance in front. Wasn't much of a issue but annoying  just as well. This tent was great for use camping in CA. Nights were chilly but be prepared for that. No rain so could tell if anything leaked, and no condensation formed inside as it sometimes does. The only thing that was frustrating was the f Got it for a backpacking trip and it turned out to be too heavy, so I will be returning this. It's a good price and quality for a basic tent if you're going car camping and don't have to carry it on a long hike though! It's also smaller than advertised - it says the 2 person fits a queen bed but when we tested it there was barely enough space for 2 sleeping bags/sleeping pads + our bags. Not really weather/windproof but if you are not camping in extreme conditions you should be fine. Had to buy more durable brackets to keep it in the ground. 2 people fit in fine. Wouldn't recommend to more serious campers but for few days in a year you will survive. I like the design and the look of it but significantly smaller than I expected. 2-person really only sleeps one comfortably. I would like an opportunity to exchange this product for the same design but larger. There was a few winds strorms where I was at and once I anchored it down right it didn't move at all.Other than that this is a really good tent. Year #3 and the tent is still going strong. We use this for our two you g sons and it has held up to their rolling/romping inside it for several summers now. I think it‚Äôs great for kids, but a bit small for adults. We have to put our queen air mat inside it before we blow it up because it won‚Äôt fit through the door blown up. The air mat fills the whole floor and is tight against the  walls, which isn‚Äôt good if you get rained on, but if you have an additional canopy it‚Äôs not an issue. The tent did well in a rainstorm once... the only thing that got wet was the spot where the mattress touches the side. Overall we are happy with this tent. Went camping in early spring. Didn't have issues with the rain, it was the freaking wind! It has a pretty high profile and you can only stake it at the corners, so when the wind kicks in it's like sleeping among 4 flags. It flapped so hard that the walls were hitting us as we lay on our cots, and was as loud as thunderclaps so sleeping was impossible. Ended up leaving our campsite at 2:00 a.m. Nice tent, worked great, but I would recommend you only by it for yourself!! 2 people is very tight!! When your 6 ft 3 inches, I did not fit in there very well at all! Good tent Had ripped seams in it, junk zipper. Used it once. They won't take it back. Came with a broken rod. Spoke with customer service and was given the run around. Had to make something work for my camping trip Very roomie. Worked great till first storm came in. One of the poles broke. Wind wasn't that bad other tents stayed up fine. Mine was only one that had issues with the pole breaking. Ended up duct taping an extra stake to the broken pole to keep the tent up for the night and cut the camp trip early. Great tent!!  Easy to set up and take down.  You can easily fit the tent and a footprint in the bag. The nails which came along with this product are very thin.  Had tough time to put those in hard ground .  Tent material is not that great but survived this colder windy condition . I like it for the usual normal usage and ease and speed of setup. But neither is it full proof to wind or rain. So please beware. I just avoid these two elements if I can. It's easily avoided as it's my backyard. I won't take this to camp for sure. Ordered this as a tent to have on hand in case our family does some light (very light) camping. Upon taking the tent out for a dry run, and even before assembling it, we noticed rips in the tent, including at the bottom near where the poles end. We realize that if we put the tent up, the tension risks tearing the rip even more. At the same time, we have an overnight camp out scheduled soon and I don't know if amazon can take care of replacing it fast enough. Not a happy (light) camper. We unboxed the tent and set it up in our living room this weekend. Unfortunately, the zipper on the door snagged and the whole thing will not come together. It was a Christmas gift and the return date expire 9 days ago. Totally bummed. It looks like a great tent, but with the zipper busted, it‚Äôs not functional. Wish we would have tested it out sooner. You get what you paid for. It is good for it's price, just a little tiny for two people. If you want a bigger or better quality you gotta spend more money. Would've given 5 stars but this is why.....I've always had high regards for Coleman brand. However, I did not learn to speak or read Spanish and the instructions are written in Spanish. Thought English instructions would be included. Fortunately, I am smarter than the tent, will be able to figure it out. Just disappointed that I live in the USA, and thought Coleman was a pretty good bet that I would be able to have English instructions as primary, but not so, just Spanish ‚òπÔ∏è. Great tent for the price put it through some pretty intense rain storms did find some water but comparatively it did do pretty well. Good for some one looking to do some more casual camping. it only fits one person not two Finally took this tent out camping after buying it in December and wasn't impressed. It rained on our trip and the tent leaked badly, I mean puddles inside the tent. We even found one small hole and a few smaller pin holes in the tarp floor. Most of the leaking came from the seam where the floor and tent meet. It was pretty heavy rain so I can understand some water getting in but not the amount we had. All of our stuff around the edges of the tent was soaked, the middle stayed dry. Do yourself a favor and invest in a good quality tent. Was disappointed in the tent. It seemed like the poles were not the correct length for the tent because the material was so droopy along the walls. Material was sagging so much that I needed to sleep in the middle of the tent to avoid touching the sides. Weird. Instructions tell me not to leave this tent set up for long periods of time. So I'm going to do an experiment. Mostly in the shade, I'll leave it up till it dies, like a homeless person would. I think it'll last at least 6 to 9 months.All this is in honor of the RIDICULOUS amount of homeless humans in my country....Usa Great DRY WEATHER tent.  It rained the one time I used it, and it leaked like something that leaks badly, to the point where I was able to use a coffee cup to scoop out the water.  Returned it for a refund, which went well. We used this for one week.  The elastic bands that hold the rods together all came apart and the telescoping pieces can no longer support the tent.  It was really a total waste of money.  It's a real disappointment, and I would recommend you not buy this product. Not enough space for two ppl. I was very excited for this tent. It was a great price and the perfect size. After receiving the tent, I set it up in no time at all and made sure I liked it. All was well...Then when it came time for the camping trip...I went to put the tent together and found one of the poles had broken. I had to ingeniously fix the pole in order to use the tent for my camping trip. I am very unhappy that my brand new tent pole broke. If you set up all the flaps you won‚Äôt have any dew in the morning, and it secures down to the ground pretty good comes with ties and stakes in the bag and wraps up very compactYou really don‚Äôt want to fit more than 2 in here, but I‚Äôm 6‚Äù2‚Äô and I fit. My twin air mattress literally fits in it perfectly length and width edge to edge I'm 6' tall and when I lay down in the tent my head touches one side, and my feet the other. Not even close to being 7' wide. It was very easy to set up even for a first time user. It really held up in windy conditions and was water-resistant. However, overnight the bottom of the tent seemed to let the in. Overall I would recommend this tent for campers who don't want to spend a lot of money and get a good quality product. Love the tent and set up was a breeze. However we tented out for 2 nights and the second night it rained. The seam of the tent leaked in water and the floor was wet and the sneakers and clothes under the seam were drenched. Quite disappointed as it seemed like a nice quality tent. I'm glad I made the purchase. Tent is water resistant. Easy to assemble. Took a whole  10 minutes to assemble it! LOL! definitely a great deal if you are hiking into a campsite. It's very lightweight. Way to carry! I‚Äôm a bit disappointed.. I got a 4 person tent hoping it would be more roomy but there is no way you could fit four ppl in here comfortably! Unless maybe it was four very skinny/shorter ppl even then it would still be snug in my opinion. It is very good quality and was easy to put up I just wish it was bigger. Would not recommend for larger/taller people. Easy to set up. Fits a queen mattress but could fit two twin sized mattresses comfortably with room to spare."
18,"ComfyBrace Posture Corrector-Back Brace for Men and Women- Fully Adjustable Straightener for Mid, Upper Spine Support- Neck, Shoulder, Clavicle and Back Pain Relief-Breathable",Sports and Outdoors,"I was really hyped about this back support but when I got it I had to tighten the straps so much they cut into my underarms.  Very uncomfortable.  It's a great idea, but it's not for me.  Sent it back. Doesn‚Äôt ride up as much as other brands Horrible. Don't waste your money. Very comfy! Great customer service as well. Perfect for the price! Affordable, comfortable, and serves it's purpose Ordered this a few months ago after seeing other posture correctors online for my husband and I. We use ours daily during our workouts and recently I have been noticing a big change in our posture... our hunchbacks are almost gone!! Will continue using this as recommended to achieve final results! Did nothing - pretty frustrating to put on and uncomfortable Uncomfortable hard to adjust This support was recommended to me by a friend who was using it post-surgery for upper back/shoulder recovery.  My experience with it has been that it constantly rides up in back and the top of the vertical band rests on the back of my neck.  I continually had to  attempt to reposition it with little success.  Also, the straps irritated my arms even while wearing it over a shirt with short sleeves.  If it would stay in position I think it would help posture and the irritation to the arms could be managed. Owner asked for a review with a pity me letter so here it is. I am 5'1 and 90 lbs and went as tight as I could go since it was big on me. It cut off the circulation on my arms and if I loosened it, it would defeat the purpose and not help posture. Though it did help relieve some back pain, had to return due to restricted circulation. This brace is really good for helping correct my posture as I am constantly hunched over or not sitting properly. Even after taking this off I feel that my back is training a little bit more to sit upright. This did not work for us. It does not stay in place Helped improve my posture a lot. Thanks Has helped my posture so much since I started working from home - highly recommend! I‚Äôm a 6 foot 200 pound guy with broad shoulders. No matter how tight I got this thing my shoulders still slouched forward and posture wasn‚Äôt influenced.  I‚Äôm sure it works for some people, but if you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôll need something stronger When I first put the brace on, I immediately noticed how uncomfortable it was in my armpits. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt because my physical therapist recommended this specific product. He did mention that it does slip a lot when he himself wears it and I experience the very same thing.  Because I have a shoulder/arm injury, it is very difficult for me to constantly pull the brace down to reposition it. I wanted a brace that would keep me holding the correct posture however; this product allows you to still slouch and is only a reminder that you need to set up straight. I will be requesting a refund. This is not easy to put on alone. This is a great option for people that have supportive people that are willing and able to help you don and doff it then this is a good product and works. But if you are someone that lives alone, with nothing in in your regrets and sorrows... in a van... down by the river, then you may have trouble using this product and it will just be another item to add to your list of regrets. I had found this brace to be uncomfortable. It was constantly riding up in the back and was uncomfortable in the underarm area. It was cheaper than most, shipped fast but the quality according to my mom whom I purchased it for‚Ä¶. Says it‚Äôs not good and did nothing for her problem. You pull the strap closed after adjusting it and it open right back. Velcro not strong I my opinion. This isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd get or recommend! Sorry my honest opinion! Cool concept though Only dislike: The Velcro straps do not work effectively after only two months - needs a replacement - please contact me.Likes:  Easy to use - any discomfort is good as it reminds me to straighten up my posture - quite small appearance, so  I wear it everywhere  (like a backpack) - easy to put on/off. I liked that the brace supports my back well and the velcro holds the brace in place. however I do notice that the brace does 'creep' upwards onto my neck and I have to constantly pull it down. Wish it stayed put on the center of my back but other than that, works well. The Velcro straps did not slipped off underneath the straps below and dug in to both armpits. This product has helped me very much in fixing my posture which I have had problems with for a couple years now. It came at a convenient price and it's not noticeable when wearing it after awhile. I'm 6'3"", 230lbs, it's difficult to put on, and a nightmare to take off.  It rests at the top of my back, so I'm not sure it is working as intended for me. Not very comfortable... kind of irritating to wear... wasted my money.... It doesn‚Äôt work I'm returning did nothing for me Used for shoulder support but is uncomfortable to wear. Straps seem narrow. On the small side for a 180 lb. Male. It helped improve my posture and relieve me of back pain It‚Äôs really help and support my husband with correcting his posture while sitting or standing. Thank you os much! He really love it. When I put it on it was nice at first but then rolled and was uncomfortable Not really sure if I like.  There are not good instructions on how to wear Very good product! Would definitely recommend! I enjoyed this product very much. It‚Äôs easy and very fast to put on and take off. No hassle to use very good to try and use.Easy to hide under shirts and under jackets. This brace doesn‚Äôt work. I tighten the brace to the end, hoping that it would be more restrictive - actually do it‚Äôs job. But it didn‚Äôt work. At most it‚Äôs like wearing a second bra. Once you put it on it‚Äôs Little uncomfortable I am young and know that when I get older I will for sure have bad posture, until I saw this and knew this product is what i needed to help me out. And it really works I also feel taller. It does take time to get used to it but all good things takes time. Great product, totally worth the price. Love the adjustable straps and the awareness it helps bring to my posture. I sit at a desk all day and have lots of pain in my lower neck and shoulders.  This helped a lot.  Great quality and less pain. This is a great product. It has helped my posture a lot! It is also comfortable to wear! I highly recommend!! This was one of the hardest pieces of equipment to put on and take off. Not handicap friendly.Trying to put this on takes to people. Comfortable it wasn‚Äôt. 1. Impossibly uncomfortable, velcro pinching and scratching armpits.2. Constant pressure on the neck, like it was pushing my head down/forward instead of pulling shoulders back.3. Very hard to adjust by yourself unless you are extremely skinny.All around a waste of money, definitely doesn't live up to its name. If it's function is to just make you uncomfortable enough to remind you that you need to sit up straight, then it's doing it's job I suppose! Not what I needed It's a solid back brace. Nothing else to say It's a good product when used consistently Don‚Äôt waste your money. I have been using this back brace a little over a month now and honestly I can feel the difference. I used to slouch a lot and since using this brace I‚Äôve gotten a lot better! Awesome product and you definitely get your money‚Äôs worth. Definitely recommend and would buy again For starters, this thing really does work. It pulls your shoulders back and you can easily adjust the straps. The downfall is after about two or three hours this thing hurts and starts cutting into your armpits and back of your neck. I wore it for 8 hours yesterday and when I put it on today I could tell where the sore spots where from this thing rubbing on me. Bought it as a gift and I think it does what it supposed to do. Good product for a price. This is not easy to wear or even put on. When I get it on and tighten up the back ends up aroung my neck. I take it off and try again and it does the same thing. It also digs into my arm pits and they become sore after about 10 minutes. I am sorry I purchased this item. I‚Äôm returning the brace because it hurt my shoulder and I couldn‚Äôt wear it I liked the support I get when I exercise with it. Didn't find it helpful instead causing neck pain. Gave me a humpback look, straps sit in your armpits so needed to be worn on top of a shirt, and after a couple of hours really started to hurt my neck. It did correct my posture immediately but definitely not comfortable to keep on. Great product.  Help support my back. Fast delivery Rubbed underarms raw. It easy to wear, but it‚Äôs not forth full enough to keep your back straight . Just what I needed to correct my posture ! Support and Comfort I bought this posture corrector a few months ago and it worked really well for a couple months but now it is pretty useless. After a while the velcro stops sticking well which causes the strap to undo. Also, the loops you pull the straps through start to fold in and the plastic pieces move making it hard to adjust the straps and wear the corrector. Not good as stated, posture hasn't changed Maybe it'll work for you but all I encountered was circulation cutoff at my arm pits & my shoulders still rounded over? This product never held my shoulders back at all to give me the posture I was looking for. I bought this for my brother because he has problems with keeping his back straight, but this has helped him a lot. I recommend this product! Very comfortable, good for correcting bad posture! I‚Äôm giving this review after receiving a letter requesting to provide a good review as mentioned by some other reviewers . I‚Äôm just sharing  my experience with using the product. It was just what I was looking for support while working at the desk for 10 hrs daily. I was drooping most of the time trying to get work done. It didn‚Äôt provide any pain relief or comfort for my back pain but just provided support Does not help with support at all Very difficult to adjust The brace did not work for me. It was hard to adjust and I did not feel ancorrection for my shoulders and bac k. It‚Äôs supports my back & it‚Äôs just very awesome. it gave me migraines It was a waste of money. I could still slouch easily with it on. Also, extremely uncomfortable under my arm pits. Purchased for a family member and they are happy with it. Thank This item is very helpful for it‚Äôs intended use. I‚Äôm using it to improve my posture and after using (for a while on the same day) it my posture is practically perfect. But you have to use it continually in order for your posture to fully improve in the long run. Very impressive product. This product is amazing! I drive all day, so this product is a great help when it comes to back pain relief. I wear it for 20- 30 mins and i feel relief instantly! I‚Äôve noticed my posture has improved since using this product. Definitely recommend! I genuinely think this product is quite good for your back and it‚Äôs helping to straighten out my back for sure. The only gripe I have with it is that I was the straps were a tad bit softer otherwise it‚Äôs fantastic for what it is. The part that wraps around the arms dug into my arm. Uncomfortable to the point that it lasted but 5 minutes and I have a desk job so not a lot of movement happening. I returned it shortly after. I have been putting off buying something for my bad posture. Then I ran into this and I think this is the best thing. This really helps me with my posture I wear this all the time, I am so glad I bought this. It doesn't work DONT BUY ITHard to put onDosent make a differenceA backpack full of rocks works better This thing was built for a small person.  I‚Äôm a 44‚Äù chest, wear an XL coat.  With the straps at full extension I could just squeeze the thing on........but that ends your blood flow.  Might work for a smaller person but not for me. Decent one size fits all, but not a great design for larger people. Too hard to get in and off The comfy brace is well made and easy to put on. I just started using it and while I can't wear it for long periods yet I do notice a difference when wearing it while working at my desk. I try to wear it every day so that I can gradually better my posture. Thanks for this affordable and helpful product! This is a good product!! I bought three posture correctors for my family and i have seen a change on there postures right away. If you are looking for something to correct your posture or to support it then this is a great product. But if the corrected begins to hurt your under arms it is just a reminder that you are slouching and need to sit up straight. Overall, a great product to invest your money in. Dont buy. All it did was cut the circulation off in my arms Only used it for one shift at work because it kept sliding up into my armpits, even after tightening more. I got a burn mark in both of my armpits because of it. Other than that, It does the job & gives posture support. I bought this brace while I was studying for weeks on end because I found myself hunched over the desk and computer all the time. This brace is good to wear since when it's on it reminds you to sit upright with good posture. It doesn't pull you into a good posture itself, but it will be more uncomfortable if you are hunched over so it naturally makes you stand upright. It's a great product for the price and it does the job. I haven't used any other kind of back braces so I have no comparison, but I'm happy with the purchase. I decided to cancel the return and give it another try. Though it was not the best option to try when working on my laptop, it proved to be of great use when I used it as a posture support during my long travel to India. I continued wearing it before the trip and all the time in the airport while carrying my back pack. Good product. Take some time to get use to wearing it. Exactly as described It helped me a lot changing my life and posture difficult to use My review is biased, so let me say that. I always figured my posture was awful. Turns out it wasn't. Who knew? I slouch like a sloth when sitting, but while standing I'm more like Tony Robbins. If you've got poor standing posture, it might work. For the price though? Come on.... what a rip off. It's a simple band of webbed material and velcro.My biggest complaint is the adjustment. I'm a smaller guy, but fairly buff with a big chest and shoulders. I have difficulty getting it on with the straps as loose as they go. They adjust easily enough once on, but be prepared to have the wifey cut it off you if it gets tangled while putting it on. Putting it on definitely makes your posture better but it feels uncomfortable around the armpit area. I would say only use it when going out to run an errand or something that doesn't take long. But this is something that needs to be worked on. Most people had the impression that they can wear thos all day and improve posture but it's too uncomfortable.Also I'm kny doing this review because of your letter but see you have 5k reviews so I feel lied to. Which isn't cool Its okay for the price. But the pain is still there my arms are going numb. Bc you need it tight and well my shoulders are not very broad so it makes it difficult and painful in my shoulder pocket and armpits. I dont like it. This brace is not as effective as you‚Äôd think. I would suggest another product. I can tell this would work really well if I had broader shoulders. I have a very narrow frame and so this doesn't pull tightly enough. Even with the straps latched as far as they can go, it isn't really doing anything. I understand that this a unusual issue (though a common issue for me), but it would be nice if these came in ""teen"" sizes for us petite/narrow shouldered people! Since I started working from home amid the pandemic, the amount of time I spend at my desk became insane and I noticed that my posture was not right. I am now wearing the posture corrector constantly while working, and it helps me keeping me the correct posture without even noticing sometimes that I am wearing it. It does its job perfectly, and I find it superuseful. I love my posture corrector, my back has never felt better It was a good buy. I wear it indoor while I cleaning my house and doing activeties with my kids. After two months of use the velcro wears out and the clip in the back creased so it's not straight. Was great at first but doesn't last. I bought this product to fix my posture and it does exactly that! I wear it while I do some work on my computer and while around the house. It's very adjustable and fits well. After I had worn it a bit my body was already used to it. It couldn't get any betterüëçüèª The product fits when worn correctly and for the price its reasonable enough. The turn off for me was the seller. I received two emails asking for a review before I had the product. And shortly after I received the product , I got a third email and I received a letter in the mail typed in comic-sans, probably to look hand written, with thier life story begging for a review. The letter made me uncomfortable because I purchased through Amazon and this letter was from someone's home. Using my address like that makes me uncomfortable, I did not consent to receive mail. In the letter  the seller also claimed the product was hand made which it infact is not. I just chose the cheapest option out of the multiple duplicate listings. I purchased this for my husband and I. They didn't fit. They were chaffing under the arm and kept sliding. I was very disappointed. This one is similar in design and functionality to other posture correction braces I used in the past. Every last one of them provides a limited comfort and only temporary posture correction. It is not supportive enough to keep my shoulders pulled back so therefore it does nothing for me to help with my posture It does what it‚Äôs supposed to do however it is extremely uncomfortable on the front part of my arms. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs okay for some but if you have broad shoulders like me you may want to find something else. I bought this for working in a restaurant as a server, my posture is horrible and i had severe back pain so i bought this! it genuinley did help my posture a great deal and while it hurt the underneath of my arms, my back didn‚Äôt hurt! i highly encourage this brace :) Really didn't work well for my wife as we had hoped. Excellent and comfy brace and a very good customer service support It is very comfortable This product seems good but not for tiny people like me. I am 5‚Äô and 115lbs and it‚Äôs super big on me. Otherwise it‚Äôs super nice material and it seems like it still does help me a little. Positive, is I could feel a slight pull to straighten my back. But negative is it is not comfortable the Velcro rubs right under the armpits and it would be better for a strap support across chest. This brace corrector helped me correct my posture which in turn reduced pain I had in my shoulders. It is quite comfortable to wear and I recommend it to correct your posture. Well it has worked and I have only worn it a couple times. Ut didn't exactly relieve my back pain because i didn't really have back pain. But is very comfortable and soft. I like how it is adjustable. The only problem I have is that it is summer right now and it does get hot with it on. But that is common sense. Maybe wear it somewhere with air conditioning or try wearing above your clothes this way you can take it off easily. But in winter I'm sure it would be very comfortable and cozy to keep you warm. I'm working on correcting my text neck and overall posture. Along with physical therapy and yoga, I really like the assistance and reminder to sit up straight. Does not give great support and eventually was uncomfortable at the arm pits prompting me to remove it I bought this for support and it‚Äôs helpful, but it‚Äôs not as tight/firm as I‚Äôd like, so it‚Äôs not as corrective as I‚Äôd hoped. I got this because I noticed that I was slouching a lot more since I began working from home. I thought I would just try it and I‚Äôm happy I did because I‚Äôve noticed a difference. My posture is slowly being corrected and I really am happy with this purchase. I would definitely recommend this to people! Super small and tight on ur armpits I did nothing for me üò¢ This product did wonders for me. Having  a C6 spinal cord injury I don‚Äôt have active trunk control to hold myself upright. So when I get tired this comfy brace is perfect for me.It‚Äôs also great for when I am working out and actively attempting to sit upright. Helping fire those muscles while I try has done wonders for me. So glad I stumbled across this!!!!!Thank you Heather. Irritation after wearing for an hour. I recommend getting this product. I have felt my back getting straight and it does not feel as if I am even wearing it. I‚Äôve had my comfy brace for a few weeks and have been loving it so far! I started off with wearing it for an hour a day & now I keep it on while I‚Äôm working from home! Can‚Äôt wait to see my progress in the next few months I am a bigger man. Some muscle and broad shoulders. After expanding it as far as it will go it still digs in at the armpits, even if I move my scapula close together. I can see it working for more petite people, but if your shoulders are wide it is going to be rough. I just received the product and it seems to work fine.  My complaint is that the it sits to high up on your neck so if wearing a t shirt it's very visible.  I want to wear under my clothes so it's not viable to others.  I'm sending this back and ordering anther style. What I've experienced. I'm a female 5 3 34 years old. It helps for the most part but does rub under arms and can get uncomfortable if I'm not wearing something underneath it. But is helpful when sitting playing video games and watching tv. I‚Äôm 6 foot 2 and I do not think this is the best for me. I wore it for the recommended time and increased as it went along for 2 weeks without really noticing a difference. Plus the person that sells this wrote me a letter asking for a review which I felt really odd and didn‚Äôt appreciate. This product did not work at all. Did not fit like it should. Returned and purchased another and still no luck. Would not recommend. Work well for pasture but painful after a long use very Uncomfortable for long term use works well if in short periods. I wear this occasionally, but I don't find it particularly comfortable, and I'm not sure it's helping to correct my posture.  At best it reminds me to stand straighter and keep my shoulders back. This product does a good job with helping me keep my shoulders back.  Unfortunately, it does get uncomfortable after a while, and seems to decrease circulation to my arms, too.  Good for shorter periods of time. Does not help"
19,"Cremo Blue Cedar & Cypress Cologne Spray, A Woodsy Scent with Notes of Lemon Peel, Cypress and Cedar, 3.4 Oz",Beauty and Personal Care,"Basically Spice Bomb. Literally super close to the real thing for a fraction of the price! Highly recommend this. Lasts almost all day, performs well, compliments left and right. Worth every penny. I buy designer fragrances for 100$+ and this is one of my favorites in comparison actually. Great daily scent. Best used in the fall or winter. If used in the hot summer, I would use it only if you‚Äôre staying indoors. 100% buy this. The scent is weak. Good aroma. Doesnt last very long Wanted to love it.  The thought of smelling like bourbon and oak was super exciting, like when you picture yourself winning the lotto.  However this smells like vanilla.  I don‚Äôt want to smell like vanilla.  I already have a bottle of vanilla extract in the kitchen. I actually ordered the wrong scent this is nice, but not at all what I wanted. Unfortunately I had already open the package and the bottle and therefore it was not returnable. Very disappointing, because now I don‚Äôt have the Cremo Product that I wanted. my neighbor wears this and after asking them again what the scent is, i finally bought some! i love this scent!my only critique is it doesn‚Äôt have longevity worth the scent. you need to reapply often It was leaking when I received it , lost a bunch of the product before I could use it. And the sprayer appears to be malfunctioning. I enjoy cremo products just a little let down on this one. Way too piney Scent is very vanilla-ie. Smells more like what a woman would wear than a man. Had a female coworker comment that it doesn't smell very masculine and smells more feminine. Id re-categorize this as an a sexual cologne. Will occasionally wear as a dessert night time cologne but thats it. Hope their other cologne smells better. The value was good, but it‚Äôs a terrible old man smell. Definitely not my cup of tea. I get the feeling colognes on these individual sites are watered down.The fragrance lasts about thirty minutes.I'm disappointed! Not my preference in scent. Smells extremely cheap and generic, not the worst cologne, I guess the price says it all Did not come with a nozzle for spraying, looks like cremo/company forgot to throw one in before packing everything up. Scent does not last more than an hour or so. Will not order again. The scent was not woodsy at all to my nose, more feminine scent than I usually wear. Royall and Herm√®s colognes are still my favorites. Affordable and long lasting Smell old fashion The cologne I was using doubled in price. I tried this for about 1/4 the price. I liked it so much I just sent off for more before it too goes up. It last several hours, and smells great. Reviews were on point. This is a very nice fragrance. Can be a bit overwhelming!! Just a dab will do!!! This arrived leaking and no spritzer to use to apply the cologne. I tried to return or replace it and according to their return policy, it can‚Äôt be done. That is the only reason I am giving this 1 star. Stinky and way to strong. Not a very ""woodsy"" ""Oaky"" aroma, very lite scent doesnt last long, but alot of cologne for $20. Not appealing at all I have been using Cremo's bourbon and Oak products for some time. Love them.So I thought I would give this a tryIt smells *horrible*.From the other glowing reviews, I suspect, perhaps this was just a bad batch, or maybe subjected to heat or something during transport.But all I can say, is that it is really strong, really cloying, and does not smell at all; like the other Bourbon and Oak products Wasn't what I was expecting Good cologne! Worthy of the price. I thought this blind buy was going to be gold turned out it was just plated gold. At first spray it seems confident but dies down on the dry down. Definitely for an older gentleman with salt/pepper hair. I decided to give this product a try after reading reviews. I Really wanted to like this cologne especially given that I like other Cremo products, but This one is terrible. It is not worth the money. Scent less all of about five minutes and what little sent is there isn‚Äôt good at all. Also this product is non-returnable. So that basically means that you‚Äôre thrown $20 away. I get a ton of compliments when I wear this My wife loved it. Long lasting. Not perfumy but manly. I bought this for my husband and I like it, smells nice. Cremo, this smells like something you can get at Walgreens. Totally embarrassing when someone asks who‚Äôs wearing cheap cologne. Unfortunately I cannot return so this is trash. Thank you! Smells like cheap spicy old man cologne. Very unique fragrance. Had several compliments. Great price Doesn't smell much like Vanilla. Sweet and pleasant. its as good as advertised or reviewed, i don't know why people give a high stars reviews to this product, what I got it's not that  good Honestly the scent is really nice, I'd say rustic, and I would say it's close to being a everyday kind of cologne. Lasts all day and the wife loves it Smells of alcohol only! Panty remover in the bottle The initial spray smells amazing. Once the top note wears off quickly im left with an early 1980s Avon musk.  As a cosmetologist Ive studied different modalities includig essential oils.Heres what I would do.Add the top note to the middle note and bottom note. Otherwise it smells unrefined. The smell is really very strong and chemical with extremely strong sweet notes without discernible mint notes. Stays long though Scent lasts all day long. Has a sweet smell that could be worn by either sex. I'll definitely order again but try a different scent in hopes of finding something slightly more masculine. Took me 30 minutes to wash off. Smells just awful The initial scent is more bourbon, but the dry down is more depth of the oak barrel. Very manly and sophisticated. The longevity could be a little better, but for the price, it's a nice bottle to keep in the collection. Probably a better winter profile than summer. Way to pungent and powerful smell Smell is great, not too strong, it just doesn't last long. The cologne smells great but my husband broke out really fast. Really stinks because we LOVE CREMO products. Great scent for the money smells good. Women can wear it too. Its just not strong enuff for me. Very nice sent. My wife loves it. Good smell. Not overpowering. I've tried several of the Cremo colognes and so far I haven't ran into one I don't like - this one is no exception.  Love the value for the money. Ever wonder what Humphrey Bogart or Clark Gable might have smelled like? This would be that scent. It's not offensive or unpleasant but it definitely reeks of ""old guy"".  It's sort of woodsy yet has that pungent, musky smell that makes you hold your breath in elevators when some douch√® has splashed on too much Jovan by Coty. The scent does linger long after you wish it would just go away. This is the cologne your grandma would get you because her grandfather once had a shaving soap that smelled like it. You get the picture. I would not recommend this to anyone younger that 82. Good Manley smell lasts all day long. I‚Äôve been using the body wash version of this scent and it‚Äôs great. The cologne smells the same, though it does seem like one spritz is plenty, as the scent seems strong. To be fair, nobody has told me that it smells too strong, even when prompted. The scent is woodsy and spicy, so if you like that, I recommend trying this one. Price is fair for the largeish volume I think some reviews say that this is a scent women will wear as well.. can confirm.  Cheaper colognes tend to have more of an alcohol smell to them.  I can confirm that here as well, although Cremo products are a good product at a good price- so I thought I would try.  I won't repurchase next time though. Ehh this ain‚Äôt as good as they make it seem Amazing my only regret is I didn't buy 2-3 more honestly . I love it This is a great scent, not over powering.  I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about it not lasting all day.  EU de toilette cologne lasts about 4 hours,  this is what I expected.  If you want all day applications,  spend the extra on eu de parfum.  This cologne gets attention in the way you want it to. Nice fresh scent. Shower clean. The scent was not very desirable but longevity is acceptable. Love this, it starts out a little sweet but wears well through out the day. This scent will last 9+ hours. The scent of this cologne is too overpowering! Horrible smell, very loud Smells really good. Vanilla musky. The smell is of green oak.It's ok. I wanted something a bit more warm. A fall sent.But it dose not last but a few hours at most.I will use it in the summer. Mine arrived earlier than expected (always a plus). At least one (hilarious) review mentions the ladies being unable to resist. Well, I haven't gotten laid yet, but I like the smell very much. It's a strong smell, so be light on the sprays. I also ordered another fragrance from this company and am more excited to get it. If you're afraid to order scents online - as I was - I recommend taking a chance on this one. The description is pretty spot on, and I doubt you'll be disappointed. I liked the body wash so I picked the cologne up and it smells a bit cheap like Bod or Axe. Not for me. Got the silver water and birch cause I like the body wash version of the scent. When first sprayed it has a faint stink to it, like dirty water. The scent gets better as it fades. At least my wife likes it. I thought I‚Äôd get longer lasting scent from this than with the solid cologne however I much prefer this in its solid form-the scent is different and for me, preferable this smells very good. It is a perfect mix of all of the notes, the vanilla isn‚Äôt overwhelming. Despite this, it still is a very unisex scent. I am so glad I bought it. Very ‚Äúalpha‚Äù woman-y. The smell just isn't there. Not manly at all. After reading all the reviews, was not sure I would like this, however it comes on like Aspen, but then changes into a sweeter scent with hints of  Bourbon & Oak. I do not think it is over powering. I would probably purchase again, but want to try some of the other scents by Cremo. Not Bad at all. Smells cheap I bought this for my husband because he already had the bodywash and it smells amazing. This is a great smelling cologne for the money. This scent is pretty heavy and would be best suited for cooler seasons. Nice smell and long lasting. Good value for the money."
20,Crocs Men's and Women's Classic Clog,Computers,"I don't know I'd these are fake or real. The band that holds your foot is shorter than the shoe size. The plastic is also poorly cut but, they still do the job. These run small. I recommend going up a size if you do decide to order. wearin' em right now. perfect foot wear. Yeah I wear a size 9 regularly but when my shoes came which were a size 9 they fit too tight. Two shoes not the same size and also sized incorrectly.  Bought replacement at local retail and fit just fine.  Maybe these were seconds? Ordered correct size but still too small...not good I got these because I thought they would be comfortable for my nerve damaged feet. I was wrong.  It felt like needles in my feet.. I'm sure they are great for people who do not have this problem. Fits well as a formal shoe, but as a slip on if you want to just lounge around the yard and get the mail, order one size up. Also, somehow one of my crocs got squished and permanently deformed. I thought it would be smooth, but it has sharp edgesThe color is a little offAnd too expensive Crocs you NEED HALF SIZES!!! need to make width smaller for some  of us who do not have wide foot!  Either to small or nxt size so big! We dont all have huge-wide foot!!! Accomodate please! I have to wear socks wth thm which i dont want to espec in summer!! Huge company should be able to do this,, my womens size 8  falls off my feet and 7 too short!! Very disappointed in this product (original croc) I try to buy Made in America products. Perhaps I would not have bought them...I will surely make sure any time, I again, make a purchase!!! I‚Äôve owned many Crocs and there is something wrong with these.  The bumps don‚Äôt usually bother me but they are sharp on these pair.  I could not walk without pain.  Returned and Ordered from the Crocs website.  Much better made. Received the left croc wider than the right croc as other reviews have stated. disappointed cus you don‚Äôt expect to get different sizes. Comfy casual...love the color green I buy crocs all the time. First time ordering online. Said men‚Äôs14 but more like a 12. I have 14‚Äôs and these are really a 12 Got these for my daughter and my wife tried them as well, they both hated them. There some kind of ‚Äònuns‚Äô on the footbed that hurt both their feet, even with socks on. Had to return them. Not a crocks fan myself but my young-adult son can't take them off.  Wore them to a tropical vacation which included multiple activities and said they were very comfortable. I like the shoe to kick back and chill. I can wear them wherever I want. I like to where them around the house in my socks. Everyday use. Everything you need for comfort. My crocs came with creases...almost seemed to be crushed. Don‚Äôt get. I have several crocs & these do not fit true to size. They are too small I was sent a really nice pair of Crocs‚Ä¶ however, one was a size 8/10 and one was a size 7/9. I returned them but I have yet to receive a refund. It fits perfect to size I normally where a size 9 croc.  Had always purchased crocs from the crocs store and had them fit fine.  These feel like a size 10 or 11 even though they are labeled a 9. Arrived faster than we anticipated and the color is greatOrdered a set of charms that fit perfectly These crocs are so comfortable. I loved them so much I ordered two more in other colors. I‚Äôve owned several pairs of crocs and used them at my job in healthcare. These ain‚Äôt it. Not even close. These are narrow and stiff. Not squishy and gummy like real crocs. Uncomfortable and I couldn‚Äôt imagine walking in these longer than 30 min. The right one came in bent and I can‚Äôt fix it These are massive compared to the sizing. I usually wear a 7 but these fit like a 9. They‚Äôre made for wide ogre feet apparently. I bought these for my son who wears a size 14. They were 2 sizes too big! He didn‚Äôt wanna go through the hassle of a return and decided to keep them because he only wears them around the house. Who measures these shoes?? Are these European sizes or what? I ordered these in a W8/M6, they are smaller then my daughters size 5. Wonderful productüíôüíô There are nice they fit well but look a little diffrent form real crocs but you cant even notice love them!! Beautiful clear design but sizing is smaller than original CROC. I wear a 10w/8m and had to get a size 11 and they fit perfect!I wear them everyday! Had to send the first pair back due to a defect with the shoe. It wasn‚Äôt what I expected but it still worked the bran Croc never disappoints me good quality good design. What I disliked about this product is that it was too slim and skinny but it still worked out fine 4.5 rating if I could but overall it‚Äôs  a solid 4 Purchased a pair of Crocs and they run small. I noticed over 1,400 views say that they run small. I called Amazon trying to return and purchase a size up for the same price I bought the originals but the selling company has no customer service‚Ä¶ I wish I just had bought them in a store or from another vendor with customer service. I have a pair of crocs that I bought from their website, and I have a pair of knock offs from Walmart. I bought these for my dad because he has problems with his feet. They feel more like the knock offs from walmart than they do the real deal. They are hard instead of cushy and they feel more like a 10 than an 11.NOT WORTH THE MONEY Toooo Big (‚Äòlength and width). ‚ÄòMoore like a size 8 Through my old crocs, start wearing my new. A little narrow,  however, I  need to wear shoes to form to my feet. Gary will go with my cloths. Product a little tight, new stuff feeling, width Is adequate for now, will give a little as time goes on. Kudos to all involved in sending this product. M Not the size I expected. Runs small. The sole did not feel as supportive, and is harder with less massage type feeling than I experienced with my previous pair. The size printed on shoe was the size I ordered based on using that size in past. They were not the same size. I had to return them. I guess they dont have a consistent process. With summer almost over, I wanted a slip on shoe  with a closed toe. This traditional Croc was exactly what I wanted. The recommendations regarding sizing were spot on. I selected one full size lower than normal for me, and the fit is perfect. These are extremely hard and uncomfortable crocs. They feel like unauthentic crocs. Caused blistering and so uncomfortable to use. Can‚Äôt even get my money back for these low quality shoes My navy blue crocs came in and they're really cute but the only issue was that they ran a bit small. I just returned them and will be ordering a size up. I originally got a size 8 in womens/6 in mens and will be getting a 9 in womens and 7 in mens. I bought these to replace my other pair and although my other pair was the same model and a size 8, these ones didn't fit. So I saw a few people claim these were fakes because the insole didn‚Äôt say crock and there is a trademark next to the name. I can assure you these are real. Before going on Amazon I ordered from the actual Croc store and paid full price and what I received was exactly what was sent from Amazon. Don‚Äôt be afraid to purchase these.  The OG crocs from a few years ago we‚Äôre definitely made better but since they have become popular again those changes were made so older Crocs look different and feel a bit different  than this years. I can only assume it‚Äôs cooperate greed.  But still great and for $33 much better than the $50 it cost on the website and in store. After using four months let one shrinks to small, now it's too hard to wear I bought about 5 pair of crocs and had to send 3 back because the sizes were wrong. After re ordering one pair a size up the pair of crocs were still the wrong size This was purchased to give my husband some support when not wearing his diabetic shoes. The ones he now has are falling apart. Right now, his feet are very swollen, so hopefully as the swelling goes down he will enjoy wearing the new crocs. I got a gray pair and they were great so I ordered them in pink and each shoe was a different size even though they‚Äôre labeled as the same size, I returned them in order to get a new pair and they still came out wonky. Will not be ordering anymore crocs from Amazon The product seems original, but not so sure about it. I realized recently that the left shoe is smaller than the right one. So I tried to return it but it closed on me. They are comfy shoes, however, beware that you might get one smaller than the other one and wider. They feel a bit wider than previous Crocs. There needs to be much more arch support, I did not see that in this pair of Crocs. Runs big. 10/10 feel groovy Crocs just aren't the same anymore they used to be soft and comfortable. Now they seem very hard and made out of cheap plastic. Bought a pair for my husband and son, a total of $90. They were great when received, but after 2 weeks, my husband's crocs shrunk 2 sizes. Shortly after that, my son's pair shrunk as well. Very disappointed as we were looking to take these with us on vacation. One shoe is bigger than the other. Not sure why. Love the color of the shoes. This order is not in my possession, yet.  Adding a written review, will be a pleasure, as soon as I put the new KHAKI CROCS on my feet.  I LOVE CROCS! I finally found these in my size. I tried to resist the trend but after owning these, I don't think I'll ever not have some of these ready to go. Get some guys! God Bless. Much to wide for a normal woman's foot. The shoe was otherwise ok. If I can wear these EVERYWHERE, I would. Thats how comfortable these things are Daughter loves them she's usually a size 7.5 she got size 6 and fits perfectly I‚Äôve bought about 6 pairs of crocs off of Amazon all size 9 yet only 2 pairs have fit me while the others were soooo much smaller than the rest. I tried to get a replacement and one of the replacements fit finally, but one shoe was dramatically larger than the other yet BOTH SIZE 9. Amazon offered me no help. I‚Äôm left with just returning all shoes even though I really wanted the colors I got. Awful Just what I wanted and ordered I wear a 9.5 shoe.  Size 10 Croc was too large. I recommend sizing down to a 9 for a better fit. N\A I buy size 12 with shoes & sandals, I measured my actual foot I believe roughly 11.60 so I went with size 11 Men and it fits just right but once you start walking your heel starts hitting the lip on the back of the shoe. I originally bought a size 12 Men in Army Green and with the extra room I don't have that issue plus the color black felt depressing and dull compared to a colored Croc. Perfect for any job or to casually chill around your neighborhood, can't believe i missed out on crocs for this long They don‚Äôt look brown, more like army greenish little brown I will never buy women/men shoes again! Ordered my size and they came in more fitted for a man. Way way too wide the whole length  !!! They are really comfortable but I would‚Äôve preferred my crocs to be shipped in a box because they came really mashed up, they look deformed üò¢ I love using these in the garden or to just run out to the mailbox. The only downside is that the sizing sometimes is a bit off. I have an older pair and got the same size and these are a size too big. Still, I can wear them and not going to bother returning these, since they are just garden shoes. Croc sizing depends on where they are made. I ordered size 12, but the ones I got fit like an eleven.I tried to exchange, but was refused. Wanted a pair of crocs for a while ordered these in tangerine and love them. They fit as expected.  The yellow color is perky and they are comfortable.  They should last a long time while still looking great as well. Not a support shoe I‚Äôm not sure if they are the cause of the burning sensation in my Achilles‚Äô tendon but I have taken a break from them and the burning is gone.  I can wear them for short burst otherwise very comfortable my friends wear them and have no issues keep in mind I am an older female and have very sensitive feet Ordered the ballerina pink but the color looks more purple than pink. Looks more lavender which is a shame bc I was looking forward to the cute pink ones. Shoes themselves are comfy just the inaccurate color description makes it a let down. The following is a copy of my review of another pair of Crocs Classics (10M/12F) as this pair is one of three pair ordered separately but all suffering from the same defect ‚Äî incorrect sizing.These are Crocs and there's really nothing new to write about them ‚Äî function over form, by a long shot, and they do seem to wear decently.But the last three pair I've ordered from Amazon have been WAY off in size, obviously  incorrectly marked.As a size 10, I ordered three pair of Crocs 10M/12F at three different times. I received all three pair (at separate times) **marked** 10M/12F, but they were INCORRECTLY marked. They were at least one size too large, closer to 1.5 sizes too large.Be prepared to return them if they don't fit properly, and note them **DEFECTIVE** as they are incorrectly marked.Out of a total of four pair I ordered, only one was true to fit. Not a good record. I want to order one more pair, but I'm unsure as to whether to try again for my size or a size smaller. It may have been a bad lot and maybe now they're back on track.As easy as Amazon sometimes makes returns, it's still a hassle, so be advised."
21,Doctor Developed Copper Wrist Brace / Carpal Tunnel Wrist Brace / Wrist Support / Wrist Splint / Hand Brace -F.D.A. Class I Medical Device & Doctor Handbook -Night Support for Women & Men -Right & Left hands (Single),Sports and Outdoors,"Nice lightweight brace but unfortunately was too large for my wrist.  It is adjustable, but I guess I have a small wrist and it was way too big for me.  Did not offer enough support. My girlfriend got this to help with wrist pain she‚Äôd been getting at pottery class. Maybe we got a defective one, but the Velcro on this thing acted like glue. It was impossible to get it off once it had been velcro‚Äôd on. Not kidding. Took like 5 minutes. Crazy. Never seen anything like it.It would almost be funny if we didn‚Äôt really need something that worked. Had to return it. Make future units have normal Velcrox please (even extra strong Velcro would be fine, just not gorilla glue strong) Not worth it. Slit for the thumb is very thin and hurts when you wear it. Your Wrist Support Band is doing well: I would give it 5 Stars.  Its chief benefit is the flexibility, which allows it to be worn during daily activities in a way many wrist bands cannot be. This wrist support work well for me during hours of handwriting. Overall good product. Velcro is so strong had to get pliers to pull it apart Bought this for pregnancy carpal tunnel. Really hoping it will work. It does fit on left and right and which is great. It‚Äôs flexible and can be tight. Light weight and breathable. Also qualify looks pretty good. Very good wrist brace. Comfortable and firm, however a bit difficult to put on with one hand as the first flap needs to be held down so it does not get too loose upon placing the second flapMinor inconvenience but still a good product for someone like me who has weak wrists I bought this to help with my carpal tunnel. In order to get to immobilize my wrist its so tight Thai it made the top of my hand numb. Better to get a full wrist brace. I got this for both hands to relieve pain for carpal tunnel, and ganglion cysts,  and arthritis yeah my hands are a mess. I was really excited to have something thin, lite, and can wear day and night. Everything about them was fine.. until I tried to remove them. The point in these is to help pain and with pain comes weakness I had to pry these off my hands because the velcro was so strong I couldnt even get a centimeter up to pull it apart honestly I got pretty frustrated and pissed at the flaw in these. I will be returning. This product is not effective at all. Ignore the positive reviews. I will never purchase again! Tried it on and knew I had to return it immediately. Very little support, itchy fabric on the wrist and very loose around the thumb. Helps stop pain Gift for Friend It really helped take the pain away It is a good product to comfort the wrist. One suggestion or idea, if the wrist brace can be a 100% cotton product. I had to stop wearing this brace because it doesn't breathe and made my hand sweaty. Didn't help at all. I bought sport's wrap at the $$$ store. That worked. Love them! They are comfortable and help my wrist a lot. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is they make my hands stink. Works well but doesn‚Äôt regulate temperature very well Obviously made for left hand only.  You can wrap on the right hand in a super-awkward way thats uncomfortable.  Don't buy.  Go get a Mueller or something else Wrist support seems fine, but it cuts off circulation to my thumb. I have to constantly readjust this thing because my thumb going numb from the way the thump hole fabric digs into the tissue around my thumb.Changing star rating from 2 to 3 stars because seller gave me a full refund on this item. Great customer support! Ordered two of these to help with basal thumb arthritis in both hands. I like them better than the longer braces that have a hard plate in them.  Great that they're washable and find the included handbook with explanations and wrist exercises most useful.  I only wish the shorter end was just a little longer to wrap just a little further to provide additional stability. I also wish it was a little more breathable. I am wearing it in January when it's fairly cool in our house too and I noticed that my hands started sweating. I like that they are machine washable and find the included handbook with explanations and wrist exercises most useful. I purchased this because the other wrist brace was too cumbersome for daily use. And since the pain is now very slight this is perfect for everyday use. It gives just the right amount of support. The fit is good but because my wrist is on the large size it doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly. But good enough. It seemed to be okay to just keep your wrist bound, but the copper aspect wasn't even close to what I have experienced with a copper bracelet  The biggest con of this splint is it made my palm sweat..... which in turn made the wrap smell like feet, no other wrap i've used on my wrist/thumb has done this. What a waste. As a Physical a therapist, I can say this is pretty useless Not enough support, it doesn't extend enough over my wrist. I appear to have a TFCC sprain of my left wrist from doing too many push ups during quarantine.  Tremendous amount of pain anytime weight is applied to my wrist.  After research, a wrist wrap appears to be the best way to stabilize the wrist.Unfortunately, this particular wrist brace is too small.  I feel it would work perfectly for this injury, but it barely extends down past my wrist bone.  I'm 6'4"" and athletic, so if you're more typical in size, it will most likely work for you.  As of right now, it's more of a hand brace.The brace came with a booklet on wrist issues and advice for doing your own physical therapy.  This is an added bonus and you should definitely follow the guide.  It was very impressive.Luckily Amazon has the best refund policy, so i will send it back and try to find something else to wrap the wrist with. I have  used similar splints, by ACE, over the past 15 years and this one appeared to be like the ones of my past.  However, this has an added flap attached to this splint that is not depicted on the picture.  That flap made it impossible for me to apply to my wrist  in a snug fashion. I wear a wrist splint everyday and I need to be able to apply it myself. However, my husband attempted to help me but the flap laid over my bony wrist and when snugged up, it caused immediate pressure on the bone, causing pain.  I returned it for a refund. Can be worn in many different ways to provide support and stability to the wrist that works best for the user. The adjustable Velcro strap allows adjustment to the wrist support to move it up higher on the arm or down closer to the thumb. Would have liked to have had directions come with the product though. User is left to determine how it is supposed to work. Designed for the right wrist and does not really conform to the left wrist, even though it is supposed to be suitable for either right or left wrists. I was really hoping to use it on my left wrist since that was broken almost 50 years ago and never really healed correctly, so now I have arthritis in that wrist quite often. Because of the versatility of the Velcro strap, I can make it work to provide support, but not nearly as well as it does on my right wrist. Manufacturer should make a separate Left wrist version. it's not convertible. Would like to try a compression sleeve for my wrist next. I have the compression elbow sleeve by Dr. Arthritis and it really works to alleviate elbow arthritis pain.. What a joke. They took about 5 weeks to even deliver it. I have several wrist braces since dealing with tendinitis. These don‚Äôt even qualify as a wrist brace. Good Didn‚Äôt add any support. Gave it a 1 star for strong Velcro closure. Sitting in a drawer. Not worth the money My wrist was in pain due to ganglion cyst and sometimes it hurts to use mouse. Thus, i ordered this wrist support and it really helped with the pain and great wrist support. I had purchased another brand previously and found it uncomfortable.  This one is much better.  I find I can wear it and do stuff around the house or work (I am on a computer all day).  I have been having another carpal tunnel flare up from painting the house on weekends so my poor hands aren‚Äôt getting a break.  Keep stretching, heat, exercise and arnica/epsom salt as well! This seems too large for my hand. It does not fit snugly enough to give the support I need.....however this company's customer service department is very responsive to providing the right product. They reached out to me with an offer of replacement with a product more suited to my needs. I didn't like the product (Wrist Wrap, Univ.) ... I LOVED it ! I tried others and they did not provide the stability AND freedom of movement that I needed. This is the perfect combination. I have tendonitis  in my wrist from too much tennis (I am a certified tennis teaching professional and HS coach) and this product has made it possible for me to continue hitting balls. Too bad I can't give this product a ten. Obviously it's not limited to Arthritis. THANK YOU !!! IT HURTS AND IS HARD TO PUT ON. Recently with having to work from home all the time due to covid, I have noticed a sudden pain in my hand. I think I am starting to get carpal tunnel. I bought this item to help with that and I was not disappointed. It helped with the pain without limiting my motion, which is super important since I need to be able to use my laptop. The only complaint I have at this time is the material used on the inside, that touches me palm, keeps making my hand sweat. Even though that part is loose which is why I find that interesting. I will update if the velcro gives out like I have seen a few users mention in other reviews. As for now I am overall happy with the purchase. I really like this brace! I was surprise how it helped my hand feel better when wearing it. The only downfall I‚Äôd say is the circle opening for the thumb starts to hurt after a while. The Wrist Brace is not airy enough, so it gets very wet after use. Not my ideal one but it is still functional While wearing this product, my wrist retains 95% of its range of motion, which does nothing to prevent pain or speed healing. More or less braces my hand, and just half my wrist. Maybe would work better on a female. I have small hands too, cant imagine it working well on big man hands. Not suitable for the left hand as stated Excellent product; works very well; ordered again for my wife too. Way too big for my hand, so pointless to use. It would be nice to have directions for use. I assume mine is on correctly even though it doesn‚Äôt look like the photo. I also would have liked a different fastener because it‚Äôs very difficult to adjust it tight enough using one hand. Its a very lightweight band very thin and comfortable but, Not as expected, not enough support unfortunately. This wrist support provides a fair amount of support. I feel it could be slightly better but if I tighten it any more, it‚Äôll cut off my circulation. In which case, it keeps me mostly pain free (I have a loose scaphoid ligament). It is tearing a bit at the seam near the thumb hole which is unfortunate given how little time I‚Äôve had it. I might end up buying a similar product elsewhere. The headline says it works on either wrist and that's a complete lie it's made for just the right wrist Didn't work for me I received this today. I see no indication that there is any copper in the brace and it is no different than a regular wrist brace. I will be returning this right away Bought this to help stabilize my wrist as I felt there was some carpal tunnel issues starting to happen due to my dail activities. It's so short it still allowed a ton of wrist motion in all directions. I'm not sure what the purpose of it is, to be honest. It's very soft, supple materials, and honestly, I got more support from a tightly wrapped ace bandage. Maybe this was meant for a different thing....maybe I misunderstood.  But, if you're looking for a something to keep your wrist straight and stabilized....this isn't your product.  That all being said, it was confortable material. Provided support when I needed it. Very comfortable for a long use. The velcro is very very sticky so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to remove but that‚Äôs the point. Overall great product and the quality is superb This is a really soft brace.  I‚Äôm glad I bought it.  It‚Äôs comfy, abs so far it has helped my carpal tunnel symptoms. Very nice quality. It's very comfortable and soft but it didn't do nothing for mu pain. I actually felt it made my wrist hurt more. I'm definitely not buying again. It was too big for my hand as maybe it would be ok for a large man with big hands!! Would not approve and found a better one at local drugstore! This product does not hold well and it has an unbearable toxic plastic smell that will not go away. The design doesn‚Äôt help The arthritis of the thumb. The design is not easy to use for people with hands problems. Very comfortable to wear all day if needed. Very supportive. Nice, breathable material. I thought these were very nice braces when I first got them, but I am disappointed that the velcro no longer sticks at all. I haven't had them very long. They would be perfect if the velcro would stick. The product does what it is supposed to do, it is comfortable and flexible of very good material but however the size is not precise and it fits me too tight and causes me too much pressure which causes more pain and has the opposite effect instead of relieving the pain it increases it. It is really not for me and I requested a refund. Exactly what I needed for my wrist. It helped with the pain I was experiencing and I was still able to work comfortably My wrist started hurting at work and this had helped it tremendously.  My only complaint is that the strap that runs between my thumb and fingers tends to rub and eventually becomes sore so most of the time I leave it off. Not comfortable for long time use. Starts to hurt the gap between your index finger and thumb Could be a little more stable but otherwise fine. Stinks! I couldn‚Äôt stand the smell enough to wear it. This is an added support to help me with my weak wrist and is a big benefit for me.. Both my thumbs were dislocated in an accident a few years ago. Since, I have a lot of pain that seems tostem from my wrist to the last knuckle on each thumb. I've tried numerous braces and wraps but noneput the pressure where I need it until I tried this one.Con: The edge is irritating to my wrist. To combat this I wear a compression glove under the wrap andthat keeps the edge off my skin.Dano A great help when my wrist is overly fatigued. Comfy despite the amount of time I wear it! Go try things on before you eyeball the product that you're thinking about.  This gapped and wasn't as described. What doctor recommended this. It was a bit bulky. Wished it was thinner. Had to cut the thumb opening because it was cutting into my skin. I bought this product for my mother when she first put it on she said It felt great we'll see how it works out but I think it's going to be just fine I'm glad I got it tomorrow. Arrive and I hope it'll be a great addition I have Wrist Tenosynovitis and it bothers me for a few months. Recently, I have been cleaning my place and it gets worse than ever. I google for a solution, and I saw others mentioned that the wrist brace will help. So I tried to find some wrist braces for myself, and then I saw ""Doctor Developed Premium Copper Lined Wrist Support "" and looked into the reviews. I saw this product have some outstanding reviews, so I purchased it. To be honest, I was not sure how well it will turn out. I received my wrist brace on December 28, 2020. I've been wearing it daily based unless I need to wash stuff. It helps a lot. However, this product fit better during the daytime. It provides more flexibility. I bought this for my wrist that was in a cast thi king it was good enough. The base is good quality but short and it is more for the right hand than the left one. Perfect for sleeping I have been using it for couples month now feels better Comfortable to wear and seems to be helping.  I use a computer mouse and get pain in thumb and wrist from clicking.  I have  worn several days and will continue.  Came with pamphlet showing helpful wrist exercises. I like that it isn't as big and bulky as other wrist braces and allows for a bit more motion. However, it's a bit big on my small wrist and it does offer some support, but not quite the compression I was looking for. Overall it's a good buy and well made, just not for what I need it for. Not very effective in locking your wrist even though it feels super tight. I have a 6‚Äù wrist so it is quite unwieldy trying to compress this brace tight enough to provide good support. In addition, the large velcro tab is so massively long, wide and strong it is very difficult to pull away without causing pain and possible further injury. If they had used the style of soft velcro that is used for the inside round tab, it would be easier. I even cut the tab down to less than an inch and it is still hurts when I pull it off.On the other hand, if you have a larger wrist, it would be stretched a bit and the big piece of velcro would actually be an asset as it would contribute to stabilizing the wrist.I would return it if I had not cut it down. I can probably use it later as my wrist heals. It is very well made. ave this product of four out of five because although it did not work for my application I do believe it would be helpful 4 people doing office work during the day.I bought this due to pregnancy induced nighttime carpal tunnel and it did not seem to stabilize my wrist enough to prevent the painful tingles. It is very good support for my wrist. I should get it earlier. maybe my arm is too skinny for this thing but it doesn't fit at all and cuts off circulation to thumb.  totally worthless for me For my need, I think a different style (glove-like) would work better for me.  Will be checking on this site again. I don‚Äôt love this. It doesn‚Äôt hold my wrist secure at all unless it‚Äôs so tight that it leaves indentation marks. no idea what to do with this It is a bit bulky and weird to put on but it does the job I lost my older one and ordered this in a pinch and its doing greatI type for 14 hours a day 5 days a week between my two jobs so we will see how long it holds up Sprained my wrist and this helps me keep it from overextending.  It does start to smell after a while It is very bulkie and hard to tighten. Does not fit snug around the thumb. Feels pretty good onve I get it on Its very hard to put on by yourself, and its not very comfortable. Once you finally get it on right, it will loosen after a short time, making you readjust itDont buy this, just buy a regular wrist brace I do not like anything about this wrist support. It cannot be wrapped  in any way, no matter how it is positioned to offer support. I purchased for hand, wrist and thumb pain. I have small hands and even when wrapped as tight as possible, it is useless for any kind of support. Made my thumb, hand and wrist hurt worse. Light and flexible, good! Fits either hand. Have been wearing it for the last 2 days, but it doesn't seem to help. It was a poor design in my opinion. Its hard to get leverage to make the brace ""tight"" with one hand. Also your thumb can be sore if pulled just a tad tight. Overall it does not feel comfortable It helped to my wrist pain but unfortunately its design is very uncomfortable in my thumb area i stopped using it, it was causing me issues where there were not. Maybe it will work for other persons not for me. This product may work for some light requirements, but isn't near strong enough for most persons, in my opinion.However, the customer service is great in trying to resolve my issues with the product. I thought the fitting can be adjusted to what's comfortable. Pretty difficult to wrap without assistance. The fabric starts to rip under heavy use after a while. I bought the pink version of this product in the past and really liked‚Ä¶I needed to get another one and decided to try another brand‚Ä¶it was a big mistake as I had to return wait for this product‚Ä¶the product came later than promised,  it it was worth the waiting. I love how his brace is comfortable and yet sturdy. It is washable and dry very fast. I highly recommend this brace if you are looking for wrist support. Help for good support looks to big but is very confortable I am using this strictly cosmetically. I do not find it supportive at all. 2nd one price is right got paint all over first one. I sweat quite a bit with it and needed a second so I could wash out. A little difficult to wrap tightly. But once it's on it seems to help. Fairly comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. I dislike the sweat, the material is awful.  I cannot even wear these ten minutes, without feeling icky where the material is wrapped around. I love this product it helps me Pretty restricted but I hope it does it‚Äôs job. I have smaller wrist and this thing did not feel snug enough.  That being said my skin was acting sensitive and itch with the brace even though it was not even on tight.  I felt like it was still giving me decent support as I tried lifting weights at gym.  But it felt too bulky to do yoga moves such as down dog bending my wrist.  In the end I returned it because my skin was getting so itch.  But if your skin is not so sensitive this might work for you. Very well made, the first Velcro piece is a great idea to really customize how tight you want it. But it‚Äôs also kinda hard to do on your own if you want it really tight. Bought this for my wife. She said it Works well and helped with wrist pain. Sometimes was a little uncomfortable at times after wearing for a long period. She has very small wrist and this fit perfectly. Not what I expected Most comfortable. I injured my right hand and needed a support to not move my wrist. I fully recommend this product! Save your money. This thing is garbage.  I should have been more skeptical when I didn‚Äôt see sizes or left vs right hand.  Seriously, look for something else. Poorly made and I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs copper in it Only in the description on Amazon doesn‚Äôt have copper mentioned packaging none of the litter trays camper mention in the sticker on the back of the packaging or SKU numbers it‚Äôs uncomfortable but I will have to see if I can find out a way to find somebody to let me know if there‚Äôs copper in this product and I will get back with an answer Doesn't support We bought this wrist brace to help cope with carpal tunnel syndrome. At first, thought it was working well, but in a couple of weeks, the Velcro fastener began to deteriorate. Within a couple of months, the brace wouldn't fasten properly and had to be replaced by another product. This brace, while not as restrictive as my other brace, doesn‚Äôt seem to be as effective.  I still get occasional hand tingles when using this one. But I will continue to use it when im not wearing the larger brace. first one I have tried and so far it works well This item left what looks like a burn on my hand after wearing it for a few days. It has been red and sensitive for a week and is now peeling all over. Do not recommend! I need support for carpal tunnel in both hands. The brace is well made and helped my hands not go numb when typing or taking care of my invalid husband. Problem is the material does not allow air to circulate which makes my wrists sweat which then causes my skin to peel. I prefer the type of brace you can slip your hand into then adjust. This one is a little hard to wrap correctly especially when my carpal tunnel is flaring up. That is the second one I bought for my mom. And she loves it! This brace fits perfectly and gives just the right amount of support needed. This brace is really comfy and easy to move around in! Stability and very comfort for hands. Did not work as advertised It‚Äôs okay.It‚Äôs just that it wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for.There was no real stability for my wrist, and while wearing it I would still feel a constant ache in my joints. There was no relief.But it‚Äôs fine if you want more mobility.There was no restriction in that area. It even felt rather comfortable since it didn‚Äôt hinder me.However, again, it wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I ended up having to ask my mom to use her wrist brace she had gotten when she went to the doctor after her surgery. That had a lot more stability and it relieved my pain a lot better than this product. I bought one for my daughter who really liked it. After seeing her improvement in wrist pain, I bought one for myself. She was right, it helped me also! This offers no wrist support whatsoever. It's a hand warmer at most. And almosr impossible to remove as the velco area is much too strong. More junk from China. It is difficult to secure the Velcro without assistance Bought 3 different braces/supports as I bruised my wrist badly and needed to bind it so the swelling lessened, one of which was this. The brace is difficult to place properly as there are no instructions and even once I figured it out, pretty simple, it is hard to do one-handed. After getting the brace on, although it supports the wrist it does not limit the range of motion much, tends to slip towards the palm lessening the support, and when tight enough hurt the webspace near the thumb.Overall: works, but not nearly to the degree needed for myself and can't see it helping others unless they need to limit only the extreme ranges of wrist motion. I purchased this for carpal tunnel relief while I work at a computer during the day. I have had neoprene braces similar to this one that worked great. This one, not so much...Once you get this thing put on, it's fairly comfortable., but the design of it having two velcro patches is terrible. My own fault for assuming this was designed the same as another brace I had where it loops around the thumb and just continues under the palm then over the top of the wrist before being secured with velcro.  This neoprene brace has a flap that covers the top of the hand that must be tucked into the overlapping wrist wrap so that the first patch of velcro doesn't dig into your hand. Getting that flap into place where it is tight on the hand and doesn't bunch up takes way too much work, especially if you are trying to do it yourself and with your off-hand. Tried this on as soon as it came and it was too big for my hand, so it felt very ‚Äúclunky‚Äù! I will send these back and find something that fits my wrist/hand. Too big for my small wrist. Will be returning. My biggest gripe with this brace is that there is absolutely NO support for the hand. I probably would be better off with a sweat band. With my carpal tunnel, I was looking for something that offered at least a little support for my thumb/palm and this certainly was not it. Velcro doesn't last very long. I have carpal tunnel pain while working on my computer and it helps give support . This made me itchy and I washed it first. When wearing the brace I had full range of motion but it didn't have as much support as i think I need. Ill be looking for a new brace over all I was not really happy with this one. I'm a petite female with tiny wrists. I'd been having twinges in my right wrist when I lifted heavy objects and played tennis, and bought this brace to help. It was hard to get it on snugly, but finally I asked my husband for help and he got it on right. It felt huge and lumpy on me, with one of the lumps hitting right on my wrist bone.I wore it for about half an hour, during which time I did no heavy lifting. By the end of half an hour, I had pain shooting up and down my arm, from my knuckles almost to my elbow. I took it off and will be returning it. I also purchased a wrist brace and like the support it provides much better.  This brace is simple to put on.  Just one adjustment. This is good and bad.  The bad is that the ease of the adjustment is more difficult than a multiple adjustment brace but it is quicker to put on and take off. Once I put the brace on, I could not get it off. The Velcro was so tight.  My daughter couldn't even get it off without a struggle.  It should not be that tight.  Especially for someone with Arthritis.  Not a lot of support where it needs to be. Can this item be returned?  Where did it come from?"
22,Elite Series 2 Controller - Black,Electronics,"I bought this back in Dec 14, 2020 and today is March 27, 2021;  It started to Drift on Left Stick to point where I cannot use it.  Only last 3 months for a $200 product. I'm very disappointed,  I paid a lot of money for the controller and now there's something wrong with it. I ordered it on November 12 and received it on November 22. A controller that cost that much shouldn't stop working. I gave it to my grandson for a Christmas gift, it should have lasted much longer than that. worked great for the first few months then the left joystick broke This was a great purchase and I am thoroughly loving the feel and customizable applications for this controller. All of a sudden it stopped working?? Is there a warranty on this?? BROKE LEFT JOYSTICK AFTER 34 days!!! I will never buy another ELITE ONE AND TWO BOTH SAME THING. NEVER DROPPED STORED IN CASES i bought a used/like new remote from amazon and the left stick gave out after a few months. it lags any direction you push the left stuck foward The controller worked fine itself, but the fact that it's interwoven into Microsoft functions is just asking for trouble.  I don't know if MS pushed an update or something, but the controller now messes with functions outside of the game on my PC.  In the middle of the game, it's altering volume and interacting with media apps.  No software options to limit this that I saw.  Buy 3rd party to avoid these companies pushing bad code that makes it essentially unusable. This the best controller you have. Yes get it. Cant get a better controller, feels great in the hand. heavy and the vibration is excellent. The control is awesome, but every elite control have horrible quality building, i have 2 damaged controllers now,1 longs for 4 months and the new one now is 5 months and both fail for different  things, the charger plug in, and the RB button, this sucks... I paid $179 for what I thought was an Elite Series 2 Controller (as advertised) and what I received in the mail was a regular Xbox wireless controller worth $69.  Don't be deceived. Great weight, great feel but the x and y buttons stick often. Don't really know how to fix it. Its very responsive beside the 2 buttons. From the moment I opened the box, my controller charger that‚Äôs built in to the case did not work. After 9 months of having this controller I am required to hardwire it to my Xbox, the controller will randomly disconnect at key points during your game. After 10 months my left stick chooses when I can sprint, it‚Äôs random & stops me from being able to run in key moments in video games. I love this controller. It‚Äôs fantastic. I love the paddles on the bottom side and it‚Äôs my favorite way to play... or it was. After three months though, with significant weekly play time, the thumbsticks started to drift. Didn‚Äôt think much of it, and didn‚Äôt know the base warranty had already run out. But now another month later and the drift for my controller has been so extreme that I can barely play many games. It‚Äôs frustrating beyond belief. If you buy one, which I do recommend, get an extended warranty. The Microsoft store has a 3 year warranty available as well, so food for thought...A little time further on, and now the D-pad and triggers have gone on to be less than fully functional. How did the best controller turn out to be my worst Xbox purchase? Ugh. Needed to replace a MSI GC30 that crapped out on me. It's awesome and does the job. You should get this! First time buying a ""pro"" controller here. I've been skeptical about spending so much money on a video controller, but I think it's fairly justifiable. It's every bit as hyped and I can really feel the improvement of my aiming over my stock Series X controller. But is it a necessity? Probably depends on how serious you are about wanting to up your game.The dinged a star because the A button is kinda sticky... I've read some reports and unfortunately it's an issue for me as well right off the box. I'm going to see if I can do some simple remedy or if the problem would go away on its own before I request an exchange. I ordered my elite controller series 2 around May and the left analog stick doesn‚Äôt register when I press up on the controller. I am very shocked that I spent 200 dollars on an item and it already broke. I  had a series 1 elite controller that also broke. I don‚Äôt want to order a new controller thats gonna cost me 200 dollars just to have it break again. I never abused or dropped my controllers. Right bumper unresponsive after one year of light to medium use. For something this expensive I would expect some that would last longer. My older Xbox one controller seems to work better. I would not recommend a purchase for this. I was very unhappy after spending 200 with tax on this controller for a Christmas gift for my veteran son.  The right bumper started working off and on within 4 months and now is unresponsive.  It is not from overuse as my son doesn't use it during the week because he works and he does not even use it every weekend.  I read in the comments that Xbox has extended the warranty for these for a year and I called and they were very good about exchanging it. Developed stick drift after the first Couple Months So many problems like the joy sticks being sticky sometimes it bugs out and presses buttons that I‚Äôm not pressing bugs out and double clicks buttons and I‚Äôm 3 days off of my return period and it started to bug out like this really bad I cant even play a game with it. Buttons are super weird Love the adjust-ability! No sloppy sticks or mushy buttons, and it's all physically adjustable instead of only having the settings menu in game to work with. Absolutely a great product works great ant the features are awesome. The only down side I have found is that the button clicks get weaker and that when I was at a friends trailer for some reason controller loses connection but overall best controller ever owned. Nearly TWO years after it's release the elite series two is still busted straight out of the box. Unresponsive A, B, X, and Y buttons, but hey the bumpers still work.. GREAT product worth $180 if broken controllers are your thing. The left stick will drift up without me moving the controller. I feel cheated because I bought the controller used ""like new"". I would be shocked if the seller had no knowledge of the stick drifting, so I call foul. Gift for my 15 year old grandson.  Of course he loves. Controller will randomly turn off even on a full charge. also having issues with controller drift that is starting to become more apparent The controller was good but they redeemed my game pass ultimate 14 day trial. This controller was good when I first got it but as over time the RB button stopped responding I have to push really hard for it to register. And also the back paddles I never really used them but one day I decided to try them the buttons felt loose and unresponsive. They should have better engineered the controller better for what it‚Äôs price is. Product was defected when it arrived still going pretty strong. suuuuper expensive and there are better things on the market for the money but I like the name brand Xbox stuff personally. Absolutely love elite controllers since gen 1 but the Bluetooth is terrible. Had this since January. I was excited by the weight and feel and at first, it was great. I love the customizations. Now not even a year later but we‚Äôll past the warranty period, I have bumper buttons not responsive, A is not as responsive. Playing with this controller has become frustrating and I feel I wasted money on this purchase. B button very slow:((((( I use this controller for competitive rocket league so the B button is a huge blow. Hope future buyers have better luck. Very nice, stilling waiting to see if the grips will start to fall off like the first generation. Let's hope that problem was fixed. These controllers are fantastic when they work, the problem is they don't work for very long. I've had 2 of them already, and both of them developed severe problems with the left stick that make it very difficult to play the games I want to play. Every Xbox controller I've had for several years has developed a drift in the left stick, but these Elite 2 controllers are even worse. Not only do they drift, but they become unresponsive. Push it up and doesn't go up. It's frustrating. These controllers are way better than normal ones, but yet they're so much worse once the left stick stops working properly. Don't want to go back to normal controllers, but also don't want to keep buying one of these every 6 months. Tough choice. All buttons not operational. Controller left and right bumpers stopped working / was acting funny after having it for about 4 months. Controller feels a little stiff and really heavy. Not a bad controller but def not worth $180. I suggest the Power A Fusion controller which is literally the same thing and its $100 cheaper.  Other than that its good but i wouldnt recommend it. Purchase this and within a week one of the analogs was slightly off. Not enough to be deal-breaking so I moved on but eventually they both got to the point where I was unplayable. I sent it to him for repairs and just got it back. I'll update again after a couple months of playing on the state of the analogs. Everything else about the controller is perfect. very good controller works very well but it came with the left bumper broken Got the controller and had massive stick drift out of the box not to happy Great product. Extra triggers are a game changer! Win a lot more gun fights with this controller on day 1 So far everything about this controller I'm happy with.  The long battery life is great. Noticeable joystick drift on both joysticks with certain games.  Suggests controller was used. Non responsive face buttons and one of the paddles are sitting improperly. That being said, it is a great product and would recommend. I am returning the one I have for a functional one and couldn't be excited enough to get back to gaming Let me start off by saying this a great controller, the battery life blows any rechargeable controller out of the water, its ergonomics are second to none. However, that‚Äôs all to be expected since you‚Äôre paying a VERY premium price for this controller. My issue I‚Äôve had with this controller all seem to be mechanical, firstly both by the X and B button seem to get randomly ‚Äústicky‚Äù to where when you press them they don‚Äôt fully retract back into possession or do so in a slow manner. I don‚Äôt eat when I play and don‚Äôt know what caused this. Secondly, the LB bumper only works when its being pressed a certain way and even then sometimes it‚Äôll stop working randomly when I‚Äôm holding it. (Heart beat sensor in warzone)The actual ergonomics of the controller is great and when everything does work as intended this is without a doubt the best Xbox controller on the market. The the hair trigger and paddles make for such a different playing experience and it takes getting used to but once I did I‚Äòll never go back to a regular stock controller. It‚Äôs just a shame a controller at this price point has these issues. The controller feels amazing and the cusomizability is very nice, but the right bumper went put pretty quickly (after a couple months) and I started to get stick drift by then as well. Really wanted to like this item. When I received it it was very clean and came complete with all parts. Noticed fairly early on that some of the controller vibrations were audible while playing - Minor Issue. A month later the first of the bottom selectable (short, medium, long) knobs detached and I reattached (friction fit) this continued to fall off and eventually I have left both detached (still have pieces) - Minor Issue. The last month the LB has been inconsistent in responsiveness - Major Issue. Initially it was only occasionally and I wasn't sure if it was the game and how it communicated events. This has continued to get worse and now I consistently notice it in multiple games to the point of being nearly unusable and notice it when trying to do things like typing messages using the controller (local events only).  Message above was left for seller prior to me leaving review and they told me to contact manufacturer as 30 days have passed. So, It's currently December 3rd 2020. The controller has no sticky buttons. Everything works as it should. I have no stick drift. I've been using it for about 2 months. No issue. Now, the only thing I warn of, each controller will have different thumbstick sets. Well, I got 3 of one kind and 1 of the kind I like. While the other 2 were the taller ones. I prefer the smaller sized thumbsticks and I only recieved one in the box. Sucks. But I bought Kontrol freaks anyways. The controller itself has no visible issues that I can tell you of in the 2 months I have had it. Works great. Syncs up, no issue of it disconnecting. Battery charges just fine. Love the controller. As a competitive player I prefer this over the version 1 elite and any other controller for xbox. The controler it self its good, but came defected . The x button on the controler not working. This controller is a good controller to play with. With all the adjustable features and the paddles on the back it does make f gaming nicer. Problem is the quality is not good. After a week and a half the right stick click stopped clicking. Then there are people with issues of stick drift. What happened to the days where premium electronics were built with quality to last. Great controller. Just a little too expensive I ignored the other reviews, played the odds, and lost.When it works, the product is fantastic. Good weight. Felt solid. Customizable. It was a joy to use. But it lasted 2 months. Fortunately, mine died within the warranty, so I get a replacement - other weren't so lucky.I wouldn't chance it. There is no excuse for a nearly $200 controller to routinely break so quickly. Honestly, I only really wanted the back paddles. Maybe the right play was to get set that clipped onto my old controller. Too late now.Update: I just got my replacement controller. After about 5 hours of use my A button is sticking a bit (I hardly use this button - mapped the back paddle to be A). The controller just started to break down on me after awhile the left bumper doesn‚Äôt work and now the left stick is stuck. Great controller when it works though works amazing in rocketleague. add extramillions the tournament winner to play. the paddle functions on this controller are great but standard face buttons can be very unresponsive which can be extremely inconvenient and frustrating. After receiving my controller and experiencing this problem, I did some research and it seems this is a very common issue. Some customers reported taking 4 controllers back before finally giving up. In my opinion, this controller has a ton of potential but for the price point it should not have near the inconsistency issues I'm experiencing. an amazing purchase... I love the programable buttons on the back! Awesome controller and way better than the standard controller... BUT I give it 3 stars because my 1st controller seemed used, but after exchanging it, it was great. 2nd reason is the paddles didn't seem to register unless I pressed VERY hard in witch makes it difficult to use. BUT if this happens to you, don‚Äôt worry, use some tape to make the paddle switch a little more accessible and you will be fine. I used a little dab of hot glue which made the paddle very sensitive. The fact that this controller is rechargeable and has a magnetic charging base makes it worth it. This remote is great for those looking for more tactile options like first person shooters or even strategic games, the ability to bind different profiles is simply the best. I've seen a lot of reviews and heard about stick drift etc, I have not had any problems after using for a month or so now. Maybe they were using it too aggressively? Got here early was in excellent condition and all parts where present the last two elite to controllers used like new from other companies I sent back for either stick drift or sticking buttons this one works great no issue great company Never have i written a review before but i felt the need to write one for this controller. I was so excited for this controller and spent 263 dollars for a ""premium"" experience only to be met with a defective product. Right out the box i connect to my PC and immediately get the worst stick drift i have ever seen on a brand new controller. My character would move on his own so far north you would think hes a sprinter in any game. I on the same day i recieved the controller had to return it. I am so disappointed, upset and let down. I would expect this in a controller ive had for years but not a brand new premium controller that is suppose to be the best thing out. My stock xbox one controller i use on my pc had for 3 years still works fine. This is unacceptable and i really do hope microsoft fixes this. Better grip. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve really noticed. I 100% ordered a new controller and still Received a used one and The tag says very good so we‚Äôll find out Love the feel of the controller its a great fit and excellent to the touch ... Still haven't quite understood the use for all the different options tho it seems to be a bit much , too much can be unnecessary .. R3 button would not work. It was a refurbished pre owned controller that did not work and needed to be returned I would love to give it a 5. The controller is awesome. The build quality not so much. I had it for roughly a month and then it started to have the dreaded ""drift"" problem that we all know and love. I had it repaired and all was well for a short while. It started doing it again. I started poking around google and found out this is a fairly common occurrence. For $200 it should be built better then all other controllers. Sadly I had to return it. Roll the dice. If you get one that works you will love it. 100% recommend this for Xbox gamers. Solid feel,  great response and the extra buttons on the back take gaming to a different level. Bought this as a gift for someone, works like a charm and is holding up better than their previous controllers. Poor Blu tooth connectivity to PC Within 2 weeks the right thumb stick began to have stick drift. This is the 3rd elite series 2 with the same exact issue that I‚Äôve had. The right stick was completely messed up, I bought it used but the condition said like new. So when I received it I was confused on why I could not click in the right stick at all as well as it had stiff and Clucky movement in the stick as if the mechanism was getting stuck on stuff in side and was completely unusable. No idea why but the controller I received was not new at all and completely defective‚Ä¶hard to really even explain what‚Äôs wrong with it. Paid 260$ for this garbage and the A button started sticking 2 hours after use. Don‚Äôt buy this garbage it‚Äôs just as bad as the their junk 60$ controllers Good controller, only been using it for a couple weeks though. I did notice that the grips on the handle dont really grip my skin well so it still ends up slipping a bit. Inwish they were a little more tacky, especially when I'm playing for extended periods of time. Other than that, it's a pretty good controller. Everything seems to be in place and the controller seems to work correctly.Was stated to be new, but the manufacturing seals for the box were cut. Nothing seems to be tampered with. This is a slight bugaboo when it comes to safety. As of now product functions correctly, will keep an eye on it. The controller and everything is great, really the issue I've had is the size. Like man I've got pretty big hands and this controller is sized for small baby hand people, it's just not comfortable gripping it. This product is only a few months old and already has such significant stick drift that I gave up using it today for gaming on my PC.  Don't waste your money. The left joystick sticks after 6 months.  Great controller but disappointed Microsoft built a controller that doesn‚Äôt last.  This is a well documented issue with this controller. Great controller! the extra paddles on the underside do not seem to be able to *add buttons to your controller, they only allow for re-mapping (redundancies) of the existing buttons. A bit of a disappointment in that department, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs still worth getting if you play often. Not even a year of use and the RB button started to not work anymore. Not worth the money. First my box was open. But I ordered a new controller. That aside, this controller is to small for my hands. I'm not a big guy just average. This thing is made for kids. One of the triggers is not working correctly after 1 month. I tried to return it but Amazon told me it needed to be returned to Microsoft. I like the Series 1 better just because its bigger and I used it for years and it still works fine. It is not working properly! My son is so frustrated with this controller! Love the flexibility to set up any config I want/need.  Using paddles for stick clicks is the bomb for me!  Well constructed - truly elite! A este of money,the elite 1 was garbage,this one is the same thing,I have it since February,and start having troubles a month ago,and has no warranty Do not like the adjustable control sticks, since the left one tends to get lose during gameplay.  I find myself having to stop playing to be able to tighten it up. It is as awesome as they say it is! Still a bit steep, but I think it's worth it considering the quality, convenience of the all-in-one package and overall ease of use. Oh, and the app works wirelessly and you can TURN DOWN THAT LIGHT! What a nice touch! For the money it costs, to purchase these type items, you would expect that they would work beyond 90 days.  I purchased mine in Dec of 2019 and received it in Jan.  No problem with anything, at first.  The charging cradle is great.  The reception gets a little flaky at times and says that it is no longer connected to the Xbox, when the light shows that it is clearly, on.  Of course, disconnections happen at the most inopportune times and last for about 10 to 15 seconds.  8 months in.............. the right bumper started to fail.  Of course, the standard warranty is for only 90 days.  It is unbelievable that, for the price, that the controllers are the weakest link in game play.  My first controller lasted 2 years.  I guess I was lucky.  Now, I am forced to buy another controller.  SMH........ With the  X series coming out later this year, it'd be better to wait unless you are not getting it. I decided to return mine & wait it out. a gift very satisfied The item worked for about 35 days. Now it is not working properly and our return window is up. So we are SOL. Unfortunately, trying to get it to pair to anything or stay paired is nearly impossible. First off you have to use the Xbox Accessories application to do ANYTHING which can only be installed via the MS store which requires you to be on specific versions of Windows. If you've debloated your Windows install, this is incredibly frustrating. Once you DO go through all the hassle of getting Windows updated to the specific version it wants and the MS Store working and downloading the app to update the firmware of the controller you might be able to start using it. Sometimes the controller just decides it doesn't want to advertise though. My PC can see and connect to other Bluetooth peripherals but multiple PCs cant see the Xbox controller for no discernible reason. Ordered new and got used for new price. Been 3 months and already has drifting stick.... and it‚Äôs my 2nd one! Controllers nice and all but I did not pay for sticky buttons on a brand new $175 controller.  Very frustrating I was expecting something nice, but wow! The build quality is recognizably top notch the moment it hits your hands. It feels weighty- there's plenty of metal that has been so perfectly engineered... and all of the customization that is available means no matter the game there's a new way to keep your thumbs on the sticks. After 1 year of use, left bumper stopped working. As being after 1 year, I can't even use warranty. Unacceptable given the premium price of this product. I will never buy any Elite controller anymore, as I also had issue with the Elite 1 controller. Playing with this is a 100 times better than a standard controller Controller came very quickly but only had a single replacement paddle for the paddles on the back. Not one set of each, just one short paddle This controller feels and works wonderfully out of the box. However, after only six months of use(Beyond the 3 month warrantee), the left bumper started to only work only some of the time, so I had to take apart the controller to hopefully fix the issue. What was the issue....a small plastic shim between the bumper and the sensor which has deformed with use. Not sure if this was overlooked, a designed failure point to protect the internal sensor, or a way for Microsoft to make $$$ by charging for repairs. Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable that the standard $60 controller can easily last more that two years without issue but the $180 elite, ‚Äúhigh-Quality‚Äù,  controller barely makes it 6 months. Buttons feel good, grip improvements are awesome, and shoulder buttons feel very nice. But the Sticks!!! They are too stiff for my liking.  Hopefully, they eventually will get looser with time, but unplayable for FPS for me. RB button messed up. Now I gotta click it in harder then usual..... This Elite controller is awesome.. I recently got new shiny new.. Xbox Series X .. after using the series X controller.. my hand‚Äôs cramped up.. so I searched for a new controller.. and stumbled across this Elite gem.. I love it .. it just feels right.. premium Gaming Expierience.. It was broken. But I did get my money back in full so I trust these guys The trigger lock sleeves came off in two days Bought product in November & it‚Äôs already broke in March. For the amount of money I paid it should last longer than that! Pretty disappointing don't know how long my controller will last but so far its great! I bought this controller after the Series 1 controller almost literally broke apart in my hands for no reason. Unlike the previous series this one held on for a long time without issues, but due to a careless mistake of mine it finally got it irreversibly damaged. I connected it to a charger meant for another device and used a cable that wasn't the one that came with the controller. So my advice is always use the cable included with the controller and try to charge it with an Xbox console or a PC.If you have a series 1 controller, the paddles and dpad will fit on the Series 2, the thumbsticks won't. Bluetooth is not good but that's pretty much the only downside other than the very high price but it comes with an incredible case and has amazing build quality with the exception of the Bluetooth Would give 5 stars but my RB button tends to have a delayed response time or I have to really push it down. I‚Äôve found myself hopping back to my original Xbox Series X controller for certain games because of this. Any suggestions on how to possibly fix this would be appreciated! Otherwise, great purchase. Great durability on everything except the bottom paddles, as they are a bit harder to get to respond now but still work. Had the same problem on the 1st controller but its not as bad on this one, but still present. Can't get used to the ""paddles"" but otherwise i like it. Built solid and battery lasts a long time. Overall i like it. i really wanted to love this controller. but the truth is that one of the toggle switches takes a lot more effort to engage than the rest. i can not use the top left paddle with confidence.  if you're going to pay this much, it better be perfect. it's nice and the thumbsticks feel like they are gliding on the smoothest surface as you go around. the weight feels a bit heavy and after extended playing periods, you'll notice it. no sticky buttons! and I really liked the three settings for the trigger stops. if you get a good controller it's perfect but the one I have leaves my confidence lacking. nothing worse than trying to use your paddle during a raid just to find out you didn't give the button enough push. The buttons stick and Microsoft denied my warranty claim. So I have been dealing with sticky buttons since purchase After 6 month use, RB started to double registering, and RT getting some kind of ""stuck"" like hitting a little so small bumper first, and then registering.Everything else is OK and it's better than the Series 1. If you‚Äôre buying this controller to use exclusively with iOS/Android be wary because you won‚Äôt be able to update the controller‚Äôs firmware nor will you be able to remap the buttons unless you have an Xbox or a PC with the Xbox accessories app installed. I had neither and thus wasn‚Äôt able to benefit from how great this controller is. It truly is the best controller you can have in terms of quality and customizations. Sturdy and heavy duty. Feels better than the first for sure, however the smaller paddles in the back didn‚Äôt work for me, thankfully you can use the series 1 paddles. Also the grip around the controller was much appreciated! This controller feels and looks amazing. Unique controller, but as an avid Rocketleague player, I quickly found out that the A button is sticking when pressed in a certain way. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Almost 200 dollars for a controller and arguably the most important button sticks.. Microsoft quality control seems to be absolute dumpster fire. I will work with amazon for a replacement. I badly want this control to work.Update. A button works fine now but the left stick doesn‚Äôt always center when being released, have to mess in the setting to see if it fixes the issue. It‚Äôs pretty nice just don‚Äôt drop yours a lot like I did it can‚Äôt be fixed Bought this in January 2020. Its practically September and the right bumper is completely out.I wish I could recommend this controller because apart from the numerous complaints of bumpers its actually a good controller. But totally not worth the money in its current state. So I ordered a PowerA controller 100 dollars cheaper. Simply because it has been reviewed as most reliable Love the weight of it. The grip material feels good. Parts are easy to change. My favourite controller....at a cost. To me, it was worth it. Love this controller. After a solid year of using this controller it is officially completely useless. both sticks drift In The directions you point them in and you have to pull them the opposite direction if you want the drift to stop, the bumpers and the A & X button get very sticky and sometimes don‚Äôt Register as well as the triggers( due to the adjustability in the back) not worth the money cheaply put together and according to other reviews the lifespan is roughly a year. Buy at your own risk! Microsoft needs better quality control, these controllers are hot garbage out of the box, I‚Äôve had 3 now, and yet they all either defective on arrival or have issues not long afterward. All 3 had major issues with buttons sticking, one had an issue with the A button not responding, the other two with varying levels of stick drift. The last one I bought lasted until about a month outside the return window and then started showing faults. A button stick and left stick drift. 180$ US for their most advanced controller... laughable when you might get 2-3 months of daily usage before it exhibits an issue, if not DOA. Love the feel of it, and while the last one worked fine for a while, it lasted 1/10th the time of its xb1 counterparts. Anyone reading this should consider other options before spending money on something like this, there are more reliable options on the market with better quality control. Even better than I thought. Loved it. This is the best controller that I‚Äôve ever held, and ever heard of hands down. I originally got a trial controller that I busted fairly quickly because of my own stupidity. Slamming the controller down and walking away to cool off was just enough to dislocate the left analog stick beyond repair. After this purchase, I‚Äôm a lot more cautious and after having used this controller for a total of about a year now, I can definitely say it‚Äôs a quality premium controller. If you‚Äôre prone to rage during your gaming sessions you‚Äôll want to be able to think before you act with this controller because it is fragile. The grips are satisfyingly comfy, the dpad is metal which makes every click enjoyable, the bumpers are not metal even though they look like they are (imo they should be metal), I don‚Äôt use the analog stick sensitivity adjustment nor the trigger toggle but I can see how people would enjoy that feature, the manual customization through Xbox‚Äôs accessories app is AMAZING and I love being able to customize the vibration strength, aim sensitivity presets, Xbox logo LED strength, and the name for the controller itself. The interchangeable analog sticks is what really sold me on this controller. I actually find myself swapping analog sticks for different games to suit my comfort level, not because I need to but because it‚Äôs easy and makes a difference for me personally. Considering how long this controller has been out I‚Äôd actually advise you to look into the Elite Series 3 controller, depending on when you‚Äôre reading this. The only reason I say that is because of the change from the first Elite controller to the Elite Series 2 being a strong upgrade, I can‚Äôt even imagine what another upgraded version would look like. In summary, as long as you treat this controller like your baby, clean regularly, keep away from excessive moisture, and NEVER drop or throw this controller, it will satisfy most gamers. Probably one of the best controllers on the market but breaks so easily even without accidents or miss use. It‚Äôs astonishing that Microsoft continues to release products like this that just don‚Äôt last. Mine lasted maybe a month before the bumpers started double clicking. Have used controller for three months (since Christmas), and when I try to use right stick, it disconnects the controller completely. I reconnect the controller and then I cannot run when I‚Äôm in games. Very frustrating, disappointed."
23,"Etekcity Food Kitchen Scale, Digital Grams and Ounces for Weight Loss, Baking, Cooking, Keto and Meal Prep, Small, 304 Stainless Steel",Home and Kitchen,"Cannot believe how frequently the batteries need replacing in this thing! Excellent scale, works great also great price Too small, buy the larger size. Can't see display when items are on scale. You are going to have to change batteries often, like really often. Otherwise, it's good. Absolutely perfect for my use (dietary portioning). It moves back and forth between home kitchen to RV. It small enough and light enough, displays in lb/oz, and grams. I was really happy with this scale when I first got it.  Easy to use. Loved that you could weigh things using different unit. Seemed pretty accurate.  But now, the OFF/TARE button no longer works.  I cannot zero the scale and so have difficulty weighing things.  Thought it was a battery issue, but nope.  Still have the same issue after changing the battery. In order to use it, I need to take the batteries out, put them back in and immediately put the weighing container on the scale to be able to use it.  Very disappointing because it was working so well. I'm giving it 2 stars because at least I got 2 months of use out of it The electronics are erratic. It requires multiple commands (depress the button)  to zero out or change settings.  I‚Äôve only had this 8 months and I regularly have to reboot it by removing batteries. Worked fine for 7 months of daily use then crapped out. Wouldn't tare, off button stopped working, couldn't calibrate.  Took apart, found no dirt or moisture, reassembled, no improvement.  You get what you pay for, time for a quality scale. I like itEasy to use Worked starting out. Then it would mess up and counts were off. Can‚Äôt turn off. Worked well for 2 weeks. I ran it under a tap for one second and wiped it to clean, which instantly broke it. My fault for not reading that it was not water resistant at all, but would expect there to be some amount of water damage protection for a kitchen appliance.Good for the price range, but will definitely get something a little more robust as a replacement. It's good, works fine. Doesn‚Äôt work well at all. Have to put product off and on several times and gives a different reading every time. I use this for soap making. It has several ways to measure weight and is accurate with measurement. I recommended knee compression sleeves to my husband but he would dismiss it; I finally convinced him to use mine while he was at work and he felt the difference! After 5 months, I can't use tare button. It's just not working. Originally gave 5 stars because it worked meticulously.  Dropped it in the dishwater for about half a second and it no longer works.  I've tried everything.  If I take the battery out and put it back in, the numbers will come back on, but it won't zero out and is inaccurate.  I'm really disappointed because it worked so well for several weeks. Its ok. Its cheaply made, but it works. Scales have too much of measuring units for no good reason. Wish there was only grams and ounces. Having ""ml"" and ""fl Oz"" is just dumb. Those are the volume units, there is no reason to have them on the scales. It's ok, 98% precise. not accurate and does not weigh 1g as stated! I ordered 2 of these scales, and they both stoped working after only a few months.One of them constantly decreases the weight shown on the screen even if there is something steady on the scale. The other will only measure weight in ounces; it will no longer switch between measurements. I have tried resetting the scales, and removing the batteries and replacing them with new batteries, but I have not been able to fix the issue. While these scales are cheap in price, they don't last long. Accurate scale but any normal plate or bowel covers the screen and you can't read the weight. The scale would never register '0' when nothing was on the scale; erroneously registered 8 oz no matter how many times we removed the batteries and reset it. ""Customer Service"" a joke. Do not but this. Works well.  It was a lot smaller the I expected.  You have to use a small bowel to measure things..otherwise you can‚Äôt read the scale. The device is not sensitive enough to detect/measure small amount such as 1g.It broke down after a few days. Although there‚Äôs a warranty, when I reach out they made the process super complex to do exchange or fix. I don‚Äôt recommend this product if you‚Äôre looking for precision. This scale only measures in whole numbers. I was plan on using it to measure out medications in grams but it is unable to determine half values. You get what you pay for. easy to use a great features=  easy to change modes and simple to tare Very easy to use. Very helpful! The accuracy is poor Looks sleek but is worthless. Doesn‚Äôt work right not accurate at all! üçë I got my scale on January 19th 2021, and it quit working today. AFTER SIX WEEKS!!! It just died. I am furious. I changed the batteries multiple times, nothing worked. It is dead. Product worked well for about 3 months and now is very intermittent.Website for manufacturer is outdated and slow to load. Unable to download user manual or contact support via web It is so sleek looking  and fits well with my other kitchen appliances. Item arrived scratched and the booklet was dirty. You can see that someone had used it, and returned it.As far as the scale, works well. Easy to use. I've used this scale for a large number of cooking and baking projects so far and generally my impression has been ""Meh."" This scale is only sort-of accurate, freaks out if it gets a tiny bit wet and it's impossible to tell which unit of measure you're going to switch to in which order. I wouldn't get it again. The ink could be a little deeper. The script is a paler than I had hoped. Poor quality, bought at January, now it‚Äôs broken.waste the money This is the 2nd one I've had to order. The first one started glitching on me about six months after purchase. It would no longer zero out grams on the scale. It started failing to move between grams, lbs and ounces. Replacing the batteries didn't fix it. The next day it was back to normal. It's glitched about 5-8 times now so I figured I'd order another in the event this one completely stops working. Measurement is not accurate. Keeps on applying a negative number Scale is accurate and is easy to use Fast and easy to use.  Does what I need in kitchen For the price it‚Äôs worth it I suppose just my local Walmart had better made ones for around about same price. Just hate the bustle of shopping in store. Not the best I don't like it at all, getting a new one. I have to weigh the same item about 3-5 times and will get different readings each time. I use this for soap making and it is awful. I waste too much time re-weighing things hoping the average is right. Update #1: I emailed support@etekcity.com to let them know I had an issue with the scale. The rep told me 'this scale doesn't weigh under 3g, and sorry for the inconvenience'. However, someone else at their company saw my review here on Amazon, and sent me an email to offer a new scale, model ASIN: B0871TQ9NK. Will come back and provide updates if/when a new scale arrives.Update #2: I received my new scale from Etekcity and it works great. Measures accurately until weight is less than ~0.3 grams. I would recommend ordering the newer model if accuracy is important to you: https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-0-1-Gram-Food-Scale/dp/B0871TQ9NKOriginal Review: This scale isn't accurate, particularly with small amounts. I've hardly used it since I bought in August 2019. Maybe the third time using it the other day in June 2020. I noticed I could take some off or add more and the weight wouldn't change, even in grams, until I added waaaaay more. Or until I put weight on it with my finger. Then it would show a different amount when I took the same amount off. It fluctuates randomly and I can never really tell how many grams of weight I have on there. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a scale. Would return if it was worth it, but I'd probably just waste money, materials, and resources to ship it back again. honestly might throw in the trash so nobody has to use a non-functioning scale again. I hate wasting product and I hope others read this so they don't waste money and put more crap in a garbage heap. It works fine for a period of time - about 6 months on an average. After that it breaks down and does absolutely nothing. It doesn't even last as much as the set of batteries that comes with it. Bought it once - worn out after 6 months. I thought it might be a defective piece and might not be a bad product overall so I ordered it again. Now the next one is also broke. So absolutely worst product in terms of reliability. Don't buy unless you want to keep paying them $10 every 5-6 months. Absolutely don't buy this one. Didn‚Äôt work Great product just as advertised Buttons are awful.  Take seconds to recalibrate and when depressing them to change units it will add weight to the scale. I never thought I'd be weighing my food but my I am and this scale makes it so easy.  Good looking and simple to use.  I can even use it to weight mail prior to putting postage on envelope.  It is also saving me money on stamps. I love this scale but it keep breaking..This is my third one.... But i like the scale tho. This product was very easy to you. Very light weight and easy to hide away. Comes with batteries ready to use. The scale was not able to weigh the correct weight! I really liked this scale for the short period of time it worked. I had it for less than a week and it‚Äôs already broken. It was very easy to use and lightweight which I liked. I just wish that it would have lasted longer than a few days‚Ä¶ This scale is easy to use and the price is right. The only small drawback is, when I add a few grams of yeast for baking, it is not that sensitive. Sometimes It keeps shows zero gram when I pour in the yeast little by little then the screen suddenly pops out as 5 grams but I actually need 3 grams only.... lol I feed my dog raw food n use this to weight the meat and liver, and bone portion of his meal, it‚Äôs accurate and works well , so glad I purchased this it saves me having to guess how much to feed my bulldog I weighed peanut butter and some got on the scale. I cleaned the scale with soap, but I am guessing water got inside the buttons because the scale said ""Error"" and died the next day. I know the listing does not claim water resistance, but in my opinion, I expect it from a kitchen scale. I will be buying another kitchen scale that is easy to clean. This little scale worked great since early 2016 when I got it and it‚Äôs late 2020 now. Looking to replace it as it is acting funny and won‚Äôt tare anymore. My only beef was it was difficult to see the reading when the container on top of it was too large (like a  mixing bowl or a salad greens box) I love the small size that fits so nicely in the drawer which I will miss as I‚Äôm going to get the one with the round measuring plate this time. It works fine, but wasn't as accurate as I would expect.  For example when I weigh something and add a few more items to the scale he reading of the weight doesn't change unless I add a significant amount. Easy to use Its Very Fragile and sometimes it doesn't want to turn off Works perfect for my use, simple to use. Get the package is not good a little shabby, and the battery sent inside, is no electricity. I am changing my review now. The scale is NOT reliable whatsoever. It has started glitching, doesn't tare to zero or change the units. Basically, it's frozen even after removing and installing new batteries. Even if there is a small piece of chip underneath, the scale will completely mess up the weight. Only good thing is that it looks sleek.Recommendation: I was using the Ozeri scale for the last 4 years. No issues, very durable and reliable. I am definitely going back to it. Worked very well! Until i accidentally dumped maple syrup all over and it got under the power button. Something shorted out and the buttons no longer work. It turns on if i take out/replace the batteries but it doesnt function and eventually turns back off Weight loss I originally bought this to weigh ingredients for bread making, but use it for other (mostly kitchen) tasks.  It has a nice size surface for holding bowls of various sizes; low profile for easy storage; easy to read; shows weight in English or metric measures; has ""tare"" capability.  Very pleased with it. The scale is easy to use and accurate. It is large enough to use a bowl or plate and and still see the controls and display, but thin and small enough to easily tuck away. In making my own capsules, I weigh the grams.  Thinking this would help - it did not.  Gives whole numbers.  Wasted $$ I think that it is a little bit smaller than expected, it fit bowls but I'd hard to read the screen. Does what it says sleek and stylish in my kitchen Just started out measuring my portion and this scale has been super helpful. Easy to use, light weight and accurate. At first, when I read the reviews, I wasn't too sure if this would work but it was awesome. I have no idea how this got so many good reviews. The nunbers move up and down as the weight stays constant and shows 0 half the time. I thought it was great at firs, but then using it everyday , it started not firing up, delays , kept changing batteries, now i cant get it to go on and in the middle fo the busiest baking season. would not recommend.. Perfect! Just what I needed. I've had this scale since June 2019, and was initially impressed with its size and functionality. Its measurements aren't as precise as I would wish, but I was learning to live with it. This year a new problem appeared: It was reluctant to change from grams to ounces, and now it's stuck on the grams setting. Which is a shame. I had better hopes for this product. After just 1 year of use, it suddenly stopped work. Tried changing the batteries and nothing. Very disappointed in the quality of a product that is not made to last and with such short use. i dont use this scale religiously, but more of a maintenance tool by which i get a good idea of how different food portion sizes look and then i can relatively well eyeball the next meal prep for that food.  great product at a great price. Great purchase I ordered this scale in June of this year and it stopped working.  Does not measure accurately and I cannot return! Waste of money. This is my third scale (not the same one).  The first two I broke by dropping them on the granite countertop.  This one so far has fared much better.  It is very lightweight, easy to read and switch between measurements.  I use the tare function all the time and it is quick!  I would recommend this product! To small Malfunction shortly after I got it. I got it for recipes. This is a simple scale. Helped me loose 40 lbs. Can't praise enough. Use it well and it will serve you well. I love the stainless steel look, looks much more expensive than it is. Looks great on display and wipes clean. This scale worked well until it stopped turning on after 5 weeks of use.Edit: I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement product. Good customer service thanks! I just received my scale and haven't gotten the chance to really put it to use, but when I opened the box to see the scale it was dented :/ Everything seems to be working fine, but I am just disappointed that it came not in a great condition I know some peeps have mentioned that this scale isn't very accurate. For me, it is, though I've had to make sure it is on a super flat, level surface. It will not pick up anything under 2 grams, and it does take a few seconds for this scale to have a steady measurement. I've knocked into my measuring vessel quite a few times, but the scale doesn't really change the measurements. Again, place it on a flat, level surface and that goes a long way. Just needed this to help learn macros and it works great and I like the smaller size It's a  it small for larger portions Does what it supposed to, weights stuff. It‚Äôs really small so can‚Äôt use a big bowl on top of it. Work fine for me. I do recommend to anyone looking for a good quality and accurate kitchen scale. It does what it's supposed to do. Definitely an upgrade from what I was using before.  I did have one issue however... but I won't know it right now.  It's on probation, however. Will update üòâ My wife loves this scale and uses it for all her household baking projects. It takes up very little room. Didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money for gadget used very little. This has done the job for what I need and easy to use. Easy to use and read. Perfect when needing exact amounts. Malfunctioned after one nights use of baking, purchased in December but just recently used and it worked great. Would not come back on so I replaced batteries and came on started to malfunction. Placed old batteries back in came on and still was malfunctioning, numbers jumping all over the place and would not power off. I love the scale This scale never gave a reading that was anywhere near correct. Horrible waste of money. works Accuracy is pretty accurate but battery dies quick and gets stuck Goes through batteries like crazy. Don‚Äôt buy it. Would have giving it a five but sometimes I have to zero it out more then I feel like I should. first this is much smaller than I thought.  Plates / large bowls cover the readout so you have to measure smaller quantities (not ideal for calorie counting -- but if you put a glass or something to raise the plate it's fine).Second is that switching from oz to grams, etc. sometimes is tricky.  Clicking the button doesnt change it quickly and it doesn't switch in order of the list on the display.  Small issues, but I liked by WW scale better. Its a good scale and works good! But its not water proof! So whatever your measuring has to be dry or it will stop working from water damage! My scale broke after a few days of having it. I'm disappointed in this scale. It worked fine for a few months. Last night as I was measuring water in a bowl, a small amount (a tablespoon at most) spilled onto the body. It is now no longer working. Had to toss it. Buy a better one - if a few drops of water throws off a KITCHEN scale I don't think it's worth it. I purchased this as brand new but when it arrived there's a small dent on the metal surface, slightly above the lcd screen. Additionally it looks like the screen is scratched around the edges as if someone was trying to peel off a layer that wasn't there. Not sure if they sent me a used model or not,  but aside from the cosmetic issues the scale itself works as a scale should work. Be weary of the condition your scale may arrive in. I am not sure how accurate it is, but works well for kitchen uses. Returned as it was showing inconsistent measurements. Always round up as it's not always accurate I was extremely excited for this scale since you can change the units but unfortunately mine was not accurate. I placed flour on the grams unit  and it said it didn‚Äôt weight anything. Not sure if I got a bad one but I‚Äôm a little disappointed Nice product, easily to use, and multi-purpose. Aside from a food scale, I also use it for measuring postage needs. Weighing food, is not that accurate. No instruction thats one of the issues. And the reading are not as accurate. But it‚Äôs good for the price This scale is intended for average use to weigh my yarn and probably will rarely be used for weighing food and I doubt ever for liquids. Purchased for value. Not at all accurate This scale worked fine in the beginning then started to not weigh.  One day just didn't turn on.  Only used for 2 months...don't waste your money Sleek, easy to use. Item worked once and then never turned on again. Ended up being a waste Worked great, until it didn‚Äôt. Stopped working after a year. Everything is fine for accuracy but the battery runs too fast. It said the product would auto shut down but why the battery still run so fast? So it is very hard to keep the longer battery life. Accurate food scale. It was a good size and easy to use Great little scale.  Easy to work and very light weight.  So far so good Isn‚Äôt accurate I need to replace it Sometimes doesn‚Äôt work as expected, gives different measurements for the same thing with the same weight This scale was recommended by a YouTuber that I watch and was so excited for it to be delivered! The lcd display looks nice when you can actually read it. I think I'll only be able to use smaller bowls or plates to weigh since I can't seem to see beyond a certain point. Hoping it works out ü§ûüèº also not loving the auto off feature as I want to be able to weigh while baking and cooking without having to turn it on over and over again. Even with instructions difficult to use Bottom diagonally warped, so cannot set Tare, and the numbers keep changing as the item wobbles. really like this and will be keeping it. it looks very sleek and feels durable. the zeroing function works well too. only con is that its not sensitive enough, meaning it doesn't measure individual grams very well and takes adding around 2-3 grams before the measurement will change on the screen. Got this scale to weight my food for portion control. It seems alright. The scale seems a little finicky but that is expected paying the lower price for it. May last for a bit for now. As a scale it works just fine, but the display is very difficult to read at any off angles. I wanted to set this on a high countertop and it was nearly impossible to read the display at that angle. Loved it but about a year after owning it, the buttons stopped working consistently. Now I have to push them over and over again for them to work. The product came well packaged and in a new condition.  Easy to use, select the type of measurement and measure away.  No problems anticipated with this product as it appears very well built. This goes from 0 to 4 to 8 to whatever it wants! Really easy to use, great price. Works great, very accurate, only wish it didn‚Äôt time out as quickly as it does. It stops working within the first two weeks. Don‚Äôt buy A great scale is a gift for my wife. She very like this item because it‚Äôs small and easy to use in her kitchen. So far so good. Just noticed that sometimes for the same thing you weigh 2-3 times, it shows different values. Not a big deference though. So definitely not a precision scale. The scale itself works well, however, the display is in a less than ideal spot.  It is flat with the surface that you weigh on, so you can't use any plates that extend over the edge, otherwise, it blocks the display and you can't see the readout.  It would be better if the display was at an angle so if you have a container that is extending over the edge, you can still see the readout.  As it stands I have to put a small jar in the center and put the container on top of it to make it visible. Then stopped.  Will not buy this garbage again. Food scale is no longer  accurate after only a few months of use. It‚Äôs good and easy to use It‚Äôs not working properly I was initially  excited to get this in. I still am pretty happy with having it, but my biggest concern is how do I calibrate it? I bought weights to be sure my recipes are going off of the same weight each time (ingredients) but this scale is off. The weights are also showing 1g off each item. How can I fix this?! Only lasted 3 months This particular item was challenging to turn on and once you got it on, the display only showed eights (8s) across its display and would not turn itself off.  This was a ""Used-Like New"" item with fingerprints, scratches and some type of stain on its platter. The scale arrived in its original box, which was very warn with scratches. If it ONLY functioned properly i would've kept it.  Instead, i had to return it and immediately bought a NEW, Large food scale from the same manufacturer which is terrific.  Amazon's ""renew"" failed miserably with this item. I've only had the scale a few months and not only does it not zero out accurately, but it is permanently stuck on Ounces.  I tried to call the manufacturer but you can't even speak to a person, you have to email them.  Don't waste your money on this thing. Works well. Easy to use. Ok for the price I suppose. The accuracy is thrown off easily and it doesn‚Äôt sit firmly on all 4 ‚Äúlegs‚Äù, it wobbles and begins to read different after a few weighs of the same item. It‚Äôs also much smaller than expected but that was my fault, should have looked at dimensions. Love this scale, it is easy to use, the only issue is if the item is bigger than the scale, it is hard to see the weight. After 20 days the power on button stopped working I do a lot of paint pouring art work and this scale is perfect for measuring my paints and additives. Switches from ml to oz without any problems. Don't know why I didn't get it sooner. I measure out my dogs food and was using a scale that took pushing the on button multiple time before responding or resetting to zero. This one works quickly, one touch one, one touch to reset. Also a great size. I really enjoy this product. It‚Äôs easy to use when prepping my food for the week. Was working great for those 3 months then out of the blue it just stopped. Now when I press the power button the screen turns on but nothing happens, very disappointed. The weight number chna when nothing is moving or on it. Compact scale just cannot reccomend for people who cannot have room for error There is 2 fluid oz settings one is supposed to be for milk but no where in the instructions does it state which fluid oz setting is for milk.It‚Äôs easy to use and clean but poorly designed for anything larger then a dessert plate. The whole scale being flat (which makes it easy to clean) makes it impossible to see the numbers with a cereal bowl or dinner plate. You would need clear glass bowls or dishes if you plan on using this for baking. I like this scale.  A little smaller than I expected but that‚Äôs okay.  Nice and light- easy to store.  Works as intended. The display comes on quickly, is easy to change to ml or g or oz or lb.oz.  Very useful.  Slim design.  It does feel a bit too lightweight, but hopefully it will be long-lasting as well as useful.  No official accuracy test was done, but comparing weight to that given by the grocery store... it is accurate. This is a simple to use and fairly accurate scale. I've had two of them. Both of them ceased to function properly when they got wet near the buttons. What good is a KITCHEN SCALE if it can't handle a little liquid? Save your money here and get a better product... I really needed this after Bariatric surgery.  It works well. I love it.  It‚Äôs small and handy. I liked it when i first got it at the beginning of january. that said, the return period ended in january 31 and now it‚Äôs broken and will not turn on. would not recommend.! It's good for the price, but I would not buy it again. You need a scale that has a plate above the digital readout. If you set a plate on this scale, you block your visibility of the screen. So I find myself always putting something under a plate so I can actually read it.It's a little finicky. Sometimes the number changes or it minuses a fan for no reason. Overall it's fine.I do like that it can do fluid ounces. I think that's under valued in a scale. My old one didn't have that feature and I love it. Easy to keep track of calories if you want a small splurge on wine or something but still stay in budget. This scale is great for food prep. It is fast and very responsive. It goes into this sleep mode and saves battery which is pretty cool. I like that it has more than one liquid measurement because it all doesnt weigh the same."
24,"FURINNO Econ Multipurpose Home Office Computer Writing Desk, French Oak Grey",Home and Kitchen,"It's an okay desk for the price.I opened the packaging and removed and inspected each piece, cleaned all of the Styrofoam bits off everything, and laid out the pieces. Then I realized, the assembly instructions were not in the box, good thing for the internet. I had to search for and print my own instructions. The instruction say it's a 30 min assembly. I've assembly plenty of ""furniture"" like this over the years and it took me more than 30 mins. Part of that may be because I took my time reading and understanding the instructions during assembly.Since I can't rate these areas using Amazon's rating system, I'll do it here using a 1-10 rating scale (1 - Terrible and 10 - Excellent):Fit - 7- Most everything fit together well. I did have one side piece for where the storage bin goes that was slightly offset in a weird way from the rest parts. I would say this ways caused by the pre-drilled screw holes being off slightly.Finish - 5- There were no deep scratches in the laminate pieces; however, I did notice some indentations and minor gouge lines in the laminate.- I'm not sure exactly what it was, but there was a dry white substance, reminded me of dry Whiteout, near the edge of the desk top. It wasn't difficult to scrape off, so I'm thinking it may have been the glue they used to apply the edging or the laminate to the top.- This isn't a super expensive desk, but they could have at least provided some white stickers to cover the exposed screw heads. The lack of screw covers is my biggest complaint with the finish of this desk, it just looks sloppy and cheap to have the screw heads exposed.Material Quality - 5- The biggest complaint is the cam locks. They are very thin and cheaply made. I was afraid to turn them a full half-turn, for fear of them breaking. I turned them until they started to get tight and no further. Some would make the full half-turn and others I had to stop just short of a half-turn.Packaging - 9- The desk was package well in a sturdy cardboard box, plenty of tape to keep it closed, and plenty of Styrofoam inside.So I can't figure out why Amazon cancelled my order and returned the desk right after it arrived at their delivery facility. I contacted Amazon and had another desk sent, it arrived at the Amazon delivery facility and it was returned to the seller. I contacted Amazon again and had another desk sent. Finally, the third desk that was shipped was delivered. Get it if you don‚Äôt have much space it‚Äôs really convenient and perfect for zoom university , the top shelf , bottom cubby , and pull out desk bottom are very convenient The desk is cute, the drawer is deep and good for items, it‚Äôs a decent size and good for small spaces but the keyboard part is a major pain!Also the instructions aren‚Äôt the best, overall it‚Äôs good for the price I want to give it 5 stars but there‚Äôs some not so convenient aspects of it. Not so easy to assemble and not sturdy the piece on the back already messed up. I really like the look of this desk and how it doesn't take up too much space and just what I needed.The only thing is it didn't come with rollers for the keyboard rest.In the manual it instructs me to screw them in, but there were none in the box. Product is good for small space and has enough leg room. It looks very good on our kid‚Äôs room! good one Overall the desk is nice. The only issue i had was that the directions were not very clear. Definitely for small places smaller than expected but still a good desk it‚Äôs kinda wobbly tho .. There is many cubbies that it fits all my needs! I love it! very good and easy to put together Welp it came all broken It came broken with a lot of missing pieces I love my desk and the price for it .. it‚Äôs enough room for me It was easy to assemble but one pice came dirty and scratched. The delivery was super fast This desk is definitely perfect for small paces. I was downgrading from a rather large and hefty desk to something smaller and this was perfect.Assembly was easy and didn't take very long to put together. I'd say this is perfect for small apartments and dorms and definitely if you're minimizing your space.Highly recommend. Ok. Just not the  quality I thought it would have been. Plus it looked as if it was previously assembled by somesone and re-shipped to me. Since I had already set it up for my workspace--I didn't want to go through the hassle of taking it apart and moving my work equipment. When I reached out about this issue--I was offered a $5 credit that I never received . Came with a little damage, but still good for the price It breaks when assembling. Also we got a board that was broken Putting it together takes 2 people.  Perfect for a small space. Fits 2 monitors. It‚Äôs an ok, cheap lightweight desk that doesn‚Äôt take much space. It can hold weight. Currently have a cpu, two monitors and my laptop on it. The storage bin definitely comes in handy and it‚Äôs a bit cute The desk came damaged yet the packaging was fine. This suggests to me that it was damaged before they boxed it and they boxed it anyway. i've had other assembled furniture that looks nice and was sturdy,  this is not one of them.  Product is very cheaply made. Definitely overpriced. Crap after 2 weeks some people were complaining that it was too small but i think it‚Äôs just right. it took 3 teenage girls about an hour and a half to put it together so do what you will with that information I am only 4‚Äô10 but my boyfriend uses it and it has been perfect. We have a small 1 bedroom apartment and it has been the perfect fit. This desk is okay it‚Äôs good if your looking for something that is shaky, and falls when you apply pressure.  It is not sturdy and it moves a lot I have had it fall a couple of times I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.  It is hard to assemble some of the holes were not punched in. This desk was VERY difficult to put together, definitely not done in 30 mins like the instructions said. The instructions are not clear and the wood is very poorly manufactured. I guess it‚Äôs okay for what I paid for, was expecting better quality though. Also was EXTREMELY shocked that instructions only came in English! the table is OK not great, the wood material will get damaged if liquid stays to long puddled up or if a glass of cold beverage starts condensing on the table, also the sliding tray for the keyboard wont stay in place it will fall off if pushed to much or used to much, but every thing else kind of hold its place.P.S. I'm not the person that was using this table it was my 11 year old son, so if its an adult that is going to used this table it might be a good choice I dislike the shipping nethod, Desk is barely useable but needed asap. so I am using it.Thanks for speed in shipping. I love this small desk for my office.  It‚Äôs an affordable and decent quality. When I pull they keyboard tray out, it falls many times. I wish there was a STOP that would prevent this from happening. Otherwise, a very nice small space desk. I mean if ur going for this price please be advise it‚Äôs very wearyüò≠ make sure u know what u purchasing the price is for what it‚Äôs worth Make assembly instructions easier Product is wonderful for a young student and easy to put together. My 11 yr old daughter was able to put it together herself I supervised. You get what you pay for! Loved the desk but the parts were cracked when they arrived and a few of the screws wouldn‚Äôt hold well due to wood damage Perfect size looks more sturdy then it is AMAZING for the price! Bigger then it looks, but not too big. Assembly was easy to follow but put together when kids are asleep. Not stable but you get what you pay for. Got the price I guess it‚Äôs ok I returned this the next day. The desk arrived, and as soon as I opened it, it had visible scratches on every surface I could see. Looks exactly like picture and was super easy and quick to assemble Do not buy. Cheap materials. Horrible instructions. Screws do not stay inside of the plywood. Cheap This was a perfect fit in the bedroom. Easy to assemble and color choices was an added plus. For the money, the desk works well for home use.  I have my desk top, monitor and speakers sitting on it, and everything fits well, and seems sturdy enough.  I am waiting on the matching side table to be delivered to use for my printer.  Hopefully it will be as well made as the desk. i‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and there is not much leg room at alll. But it was easy to assemble by myself, took about an hour or so to assemble. The desk top doesn‚Äôt have much space at all but there is lots of other room. Quality is decent at the price point Its much to small and not sturdy at all It says 30 minutes assembly, but I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs if you have about half a dozen people helping. Horrible instructions, half of the pieces weren‚Äôt even labeled, very confusing and frustrating. Other than the ridiculously complicated assembly, it‚Äôs decent. Easy to assemble. Worth the price. Sturdy. this desk is so cheaply mad its sad. the holes for screws do not line up at all and it did not even come with all the screws, i had to go out and buy more. i've had it put together for about two days and it is already losing stability. the material is cracking and breaking everywhere. The pull out table is a piece of garbage and is so small it just falls off the track. It‚Äôs not worth the money for this disaster desk Works great for my youngest daughters small room, and works well with her laptop and school supplies. Was all good though I part of desk was cracked.but was able to use it To start of with this product was badly built there was holes in the wrong places and holes missing! I had to improvise and figure it out on my own. The pull out does not work!!!! Maybe I didn‚Äôt do it right but who knows. The side desk isn‚Äôt even fully connected because the hole were missing. But after the built the desk does not look to bad and does it‚Äôs job. Not satisfied enough with the desk if you can I suggest you go search for another desk. Love it. Super cute Directions were not clear, some drawings did not show the correct way to put together. Also have several times installed the sliders for the key board tray slide out, the best I could get was for the tray to slide out but at the end it slides up so the key board is at a weird angle. Going to try to find new slide brackets. Cute desk but the top shelf is not secured well and broke off 2 days after install. Roll out tray is great. Wanted for a computer desk but my monitor didnt fit into the side spot. Whoever put my table parts on the box must have been tired because not one nor two parts were mislabeled. But 3. I tried putting the tableTogether for almost an hour before I flipped out and asked my sister to try. She was the one that figured out two parts were mislabeled. Once we figured out which parts were which, we got through it ok but the top shelf is not sturdy. The twist screws easily shift and the shelf comes apart with the blow of the wind. I‚Äôve had this desk for a few months now and when it came it had multiple big scratches all over it but other than that it‚Äôs perfect. Didnt come with any screws or instructions and the packaging was practically falling apart This very small, it is a kids size What a tiny piece of crap! No instructions to put it together so it took a long time to figure it out Smaller than I expected. I love this desk, its perfect for my gaming laptop and accessories. It only took me and my gf about 30 minutes to put it together."
25,"Finishing Touch Flawless Women's Painless Hair Remover , White/Rose Gold",Beauty and Personal Care,"Need to got over a few times before it actually works Love it. Easy to use. Good product and service Not worth the price or effort to order - it quit working after a few months even with fresh battery and thorough cleaning. Very easy to use. No pain in the use of this facial product. Good but if the battery die so doesn‚Äôt work with another one. Garbage don‚Äôt waist your money This is my second and doesn‚Äôt work as good as the original. Small as a lipstick, easy to use, and has a light for you to see the area you are applying it to.  Because it shaves, rather than pulls, it doesn't hurt, but do know that you would have to use it more often than tweezers.  Makes a great girlfriend gift!!! I‚Äôm not sure why this product is so special. It‚Äôs basically an electric shaver. Yes, it works and it‚Äôs cute but hair will grow back just as if you shaved with anything else. It is not pulling hair out. Love this product. I‚Äôve bought several of these over the years - my others have broken due to other factors not the quality of the item. Easy to use. I use once a week to keep my face smooth and fuzz free! works great! Does not work as easily as shown on TV. It burnt my skin directly below my eyebrows This works just great, HOWEVER,  be prepared for the hair that wasn't a problem to now be a problem!. Yes, it gets rid of those pesky hairs that were the reason you bought this, but every hair around it comes back in full force so now you have more to worry about. If you don't want to use this everyday, beware,  it takes over! Can't wait for threading to reopen, will use cream remover and waxing in the meantime. This is a good product. Gave it 4 Stars because I thought it was a epilator and the advertisement did not make it clear that it was just a high quality electric razor. Otherwise all - good. Upgrade from tweezers and mirror! Easy to use. It‚Äôs easy to use and works fine on my sensitive skin. However, it doesn‚Äôt work well on fine facial hair. I was skeptical if this would work, but it does! The top part which can be replaced popped off after just a few uses and it now barely works. Don‚Äôt waste your money! you cannot use this discreetly, everyone in the house knows what you're doing.  you have to sneak off into a very private area, it echos in the bathroom. Have only had this for 2-1/2 months and it died! Changed battery Nd it still does not work! HELP! As far as convenience, I love it. It also has saved me money and time as I no longer get my lip and chin waxed. When you first use it your skin is silky smooth. I find if you go over the same spot numourous times, the skin does get a tad irritated but not to much and certainly no big deal. The only issue I have with it is since my hair is a bit thick, I have to use it everyday if I want my skin completely smooth, every other if I don‚Äôt mind a little stubble. Quite honestly it is really a glorified electric razor. The hair grows back thicker as it would if you used a razor. But even with that being said I do recommend this product. I just use it very frequently to keep the stubble away.If you have thinner hair I think it would work even better. Even when I was getting waxed I found I had to tweeze a week after waxing. Good product. Highly recommend. This product is NOT an epilator. It does not pull hair from the root. Therefore you will have stubble and need to use flawless frequentlyThat being said, it is painless, easy to use and gives a close hair removal without irritation. This device don‚Äôt do anything it‚Äôs a joke!! I bought two different brands tried them all what a joke! I absolutely love this little shaver! It works so well in removing all of the unwanted peach fuzz and stray hairs from my face without pulling or tugging. I have tried to use it under my eyebrow to clean up any strays there but it does seem to pull those hairs. It‚Äôs so compact and can be carried in your makeup bag and takes up no room in your purse. The little light is really bright and makes seeing the hair so much easier. So happy with my purchase! Basically a cheap shaver.  Does ok for peach fuzz but not great on those thicker whisker-like hairs. This product stopped working after 30 days. It is not the battery, believe I shall buy a new head to see if that works. loved it & would recommend it I was hoping to like this product for the sake of portability and on-the-go, but it ended up not being worth the time and money.You have to make a lot of tiny circular passes over a spot before the razor finally trims, and it's not a close enough shave if you're looking to shave any dark hairs.It's pretty difficult to clean. You'd need a pick to scrap the hair out from under the spring on the head.Also, you need a dry, clean face to make it the most effective, otherwise it doesn't glide well across your skin. So this is difficult to use with moisturizer or makeup on.If you're looking for portability, look for another product. Otherwise, if you need something for home use, the Panasonic Electric Shaver has a great trimmer and mine is still kicking after a decade. I was very disappointed in these. They are just razors! Nothing special! It did not cut the hair, it pulled it out and caused a rash. I only used once. I dont recommend this product. #1  I love the rose stone roller#2  I enjoyed the basis hair remover the result was great, make-up went on smoothly#3  I loved the eyebrow hair remover.Please note that the switches on all these products are so cheap that they don't function properly. I was so frustrated I ordered several, for me and as gifts, the facial result is wonderful but if they can't make a higher quality product they're worthless.  I was an idiot not to return, I just figured I got a bad one and bought another one, never again. 6 of these products do not work. Good for hair removal Does not work that great. Love this! It‚Äôs gentle, easy to use, and effective. Had it over a year and the battery has stayed strong! Unfortunately,  this item did not remove any ""peach fuzz"" hair on my face.  Very disappointed. Sent back. It‚Äôs not revolutionary, it doesn‚Äôt get as close as a facial razor but it gets enough off to keep using it. Did not work for me at all.  Did not even remove fine hairs. It works Well, but using it one time wasn‚Äôt good on my face. My face completely broke out afterwards unfortunately so I won‚Äôt be able to use it again. Not very powerful. Does not cut hair very easily. A regular razor works better. Burns your skin doesn't work Don't work like it's said to work Waste of $20! Didn't work at all. Not sure if it's counterfeit but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! I was very disappointed.  honestly I had medium hopes, not high hopes for a basic shave of some fuzz and a few whiskers here and there, but you can go back and forth several times and the same hair is there.  I would not recommend. Just an okay product.Also, I was sent the wrong color. Requested Coral and got blue.Overall Unsatisfied. My daughter loves this for her face This does do the job and is very easy to use. The appearance is cute and looks great. But I thought it would have more of the effect of plucking not shaving. I am used to threading and this helped with in-between session maintenance especially in pandemic times when I don't want to go as much. I did have some irritation and itchiness a day after that I normally do not have but it went away. Update...only con is when you remove the head, be very very careful. It fell and 4 small pieces went flying. I tried to reassemble but don‚Äôt think I have it right bc when you push down the motor stops. Still an Amazing product as long as in working order. It is a game changer for me! Used to get my ladystache threaded bc it was the smoothest look but with Covid thought I‚Äôd try this and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it! My upper lip is hairless and smooth after using it. Easy, painless and great results! I will never thread again as that is painful. Recommended the same night I used it to my sister and she purchased one as well and just as pleased. We were both used to using on of those little trimmers at home which leave that stubble feeling because the hair isn‚Äôt being pulled from the roots. Don‚Äôt waste money on any other product ladies! Okay, I JSHealth got this and my biggest gripe is with trying to get it open! It does okay on ‚Äúpeach fuzz‚Äù, but I‚Äôve got several steel-rod spikes it just couldn‚Äôt handle. Still not mad about buying it. I guess tweezers are the only way to remove steel! I don't really know if it's a good producer or not. It wasn't good for what i needed This causes ingrown hairs to irrupt like crazy. I‚Äôve tried it several times, and always the same result. Waste of money. Fine so far! Love it! Yes, it's a shaver but one of the best I've tried. Quick, easy & effective. It has virtually stopped my breakouts & ingrown hairs from plucking my chin. Only have to use every other day. Quiet & discreet! It's not going to blow you away, but it does what it claims. It is lightweight and feels a bit cheap, but it does work and that is all that matters. It's a great price and easy to use for someone (like me) who has issues with upper lip hair growing super fast. This is my second time buying one. The first I bought in a physical store and was fantastic. This one had some noticeable differences. The one I got in the store had a battery in it. This one did not. The one I got in the store I bought 2-3 years ago and never changed the battery or the head yet, and it being as dull as it is now, still performs better than this one brand new. This one takes forever to do the job unlike the older model. Either they changed the quality or it‚Äôs a knockoff. It's easy on sensitive skin, the battery life is amazing, and it is compact. Great compact product to keep for quick clean ups. Super easy to use, non abrasive and affordable. This unit was a good buy for $19.99 when they first came out.  It worked fairly well at removing hair.  Unless you remove the battery after each use, be prepared to replace the battery every 3 or 4 weeks as it drain just sitting in the unit.  The unit itself lasted 1 year the first purchase in which I thought was acceptable for the price.  The second unit I purchased lasted 3 months.  The 3rd purchase is a flimsly remake of the original unit.  The head rattles around in the unit and doesn't even trim as intended.  I will not buy another.  Flawless you got my $60.00 and took me for a ride one too many times. This product is cheaply made & comes apart every time I use it. It's the 2nd time I've purchased this. I won't again because although it removes the facial hair the product is not sturdy at all. So I have PCOS, was kinda skeptical on purchasing as my hairs thicker and I‚Äôve been shaving for a good 10 years usually areas most females don‚Äôt necessarily shave. It does what it‚Äôs supposed to, but it doesn‚Äôt come as close to a close shave as regular razors do. It left my skin feeling itchy, but for the most part soft. Super easy to use but I recommend using this on not already shaved hair, it just doesn‚Äôt remove all the hair like a regular razor would if it was previously shaved. Plus side to this is no bleeding or razor burn. I will definitely continue to use this, but will probably have to touch up with a regular razor. Battery life is HORRIBLE Battery dies fast Have had since late April, have used approximately 5 times and it no longer works. Great and easy to use It's ok. It barely trims the unwanted I love this product it gives a close hair removal without worrying about cutting yourself. I highly recommend this product and it Shipped super fast. Works fine so far I love this tool and would 100% recommend to anyone. Previously I used a facial hair removal cream or got the occasional wax. This tool is quick and easy as well as gentle on my skin. Don't hesitate, do yourself a favor and get one! Works but cheaply made. I dropped it and it feel apart. I'm really disappointed in this little thing. It's frustrating that it can only be used in circular motions, which is just cumbersome and impractical for a facial hair remover, where most of the spaces you're working with are finely contoured and/or sensitive etc. It just doesn't function well for what it's supposed to be for? And also takes a lot of effort and time to actually remove all the hairs. And leaves my skin feeling really irritated and itchy and uncomfortable, like I just dry-shaved my face! I would not buy this again. This takes longer than a razor or trimmer.  You have to pass over the same area several times.  Its very gentle, but my skin became irritated with the repeated passes.  I use it daily, but may switch if it continues to irritate Doesn't remove hair easily. Requires daily upkeep. This pinched my skin and did NOT leave a smooth surface. Missed hair everywhere. I gave it away. Do not bother!!! Received in January, 2020, died in September, 2020. Thought it was the battery but new ones didn't help. RIP, Flawless.... I love this product! I don't normally write reviews but when I do..  I do it because I seriously LOVE the product. This product is easy to use and for my sensitive skin it works wonders. I was a bit nervous to purchase this product but I am sooooo glad I did!! I used it for my peach fuzz and for my eyebrows and it worked wonders!!! Sooooo much better than just the razor method or the nair. Save money and save your skin! Use flawless!!!! sporadically stop and start after just 3 months of use; wouldn't buy again ; I like the package and ease of use but I can't count on it to  operate every time If your eyebrow hairs migrated down to your upper lip and your chin, this handy little device is a lifesaver. It painlessly removed those pesky hairs that haunt us and leave a your face nice and smooth. This mini shaver is the best one I‚Äôve ever tried. Read the product insert to make sure you‚Äôre using it correctly and clean it after every use. I‚Äôm impressed! Was good, but not As effective over time. Works well. I feel like the hair remover could be easier to move on your skin, and sometimes it takes a few swipes to get all the hair. I use it for my eyebrows, lip, and swimsuit line for touch ups, and knees if I miss anything from shaving.I usually wax my eyebrows every 3 weeks and tweeze in-between. I used this shaver on my brows over a month ago and I‚Äôm just noticing that they need done again.It‚Äôs worth the usefulness and convenient to have on hand. Dont waste money. I had similar face hair removal  which was good ,should have stuck with that..this was too fragile and broke easily..Do not waste money on this Next time Please Put My Packages Behind The Pole on the Porch but Overall Eveything Fine Does not turn on!!! I believe it has no battery and you cannot open it. I will not be purchasing this again. This is the second time I bought this and the first one removed hair but the power started to slow down after a few uses. I done with this! I've purchased two of three of these in the last few months.  The last two I purchased stopped working after a few days.  I even tried changing the battery.  Since it was a gift and not for me the time was off on the return date.  It did work for a couple of weeks and remove facial hair and then the top just fell off.  When you replace the spinning razor the (gold circle) it will continue to work - it's spinning.  When you put the cap back on after removing the hair it stops working.  No light no noise no cutting.  I don't think I'll buy a fourth one.....It' can't be the user it must be the product. It's a very good product and easy to use and clean. But not good for sensitive skin. I used it for chin and lip area. So frustrating to change battery and shaver head. Spent way too much time trying I finally threw the darn thing out.  I will shop for another brand.  I don‚Äôt recommend this one at all. Gave it 2 or three because it worked for a few weeks I loved my ""Finishing Touch Flawless Women's Painless Hair Remover"" - until I didn't. I stopped loving it when it, for no apparent reason, stopped working, about 6 months after I got it. I had no complaints until then. So sad that it doesn't work anymore. That being said, I liked it so much that I'll order another - hoping it will last longer this time. Can‚Äôt open battery case I recommend spending the extra 10 bucks for the Finishing Touch Flawless with the cord instead of the battery powered. Omg it really works. Everyone should have one. Will definitely purchase again. I owned on of these for a year and the motor died on it, but i love it so much that I had to get another. My only disappointment with this order was that I ordered the Sea Glass and received a color that I must assume is the Blush as it is kind of a dark peach shade. It will do the same job, I just would have preferred the color I ordered for aesthetic reasons. This should be zero stars . The packaging was nicer than the product, which felt very cheap & fragile. I was about to give up pulling the two halves apart to insert the battery, as there was nothing to grip & it  was slippery. When it finally did come apart, the 4 tiny pieces on the top flew apart. It was obvious how it should go back together, but the ring that was supposed to fit on top just would not go on. It is broken & useless. I have used  a similar product from Amazon before, but it stopped working suddenly. This got the best reviews overall, but what a ripoff! When my old one  was working, it at least felt substantial. I could take it apart & put it back together. But, even if this one had not immediately malfunctioned, it could not possibly have lasted long. I will see if I can get my money back.Update:  Got the run-around from Finishing Touch! So, no refund! Twenty dollars in the trash! I still cannot understand how this is getting good ratings - it is garbage! This STOPPED WORKING after using for only 2 MONTHS. Changed the battery multiple times.And NO customer service to help. During quarantine wasnt able to visit a salon for waxing and I had several chin hairs that grows which is so annoying so I decided to purchase this and it did the job but not as good as waxing would do. I'm satisfied but I still have stubble so I use it every other day. Turn out to be a good mother's day gift. My wife ordered one off the TV an never received it she was a little aggravated, she kept talking about it so I found her one an she loves it. Shipping was great received it like 2 days early. Thanks Heats up after a short time. This is the second one that I've bought. At first it worked great, but then the batteries that it came with died. I changed them out. It only works good for a day or so then the batteries lose their charge. I will not invest in another one. Just arrived today, easy to use and my sensitive skin had no issues! Only complaint is that I didn't get the color that I ordered, so somehow my sister and I are going to try and distinguish between ours since they're identical. Other than that, no complaints! What can I say?  It doesn't cut hairs.  Whether they are small, fine peach fuzz or course bikini line hairs, doesn't work. New design with double blades does not work as well as the single one. This didn't remove any hair This works! It got all my hair and didn‚Äôt irritate my skin. I just thought it would get a closer shave. It just trimmed, so now I have peach fuzz stubble which feels tougher then you‚Äôd think. But overall it did its job and my makeup does go on easier. I had a flawless device.  It works well, but the battery is an unusual size and when it ran out I couldn't find a replacement anywhere, either at stores or online.  Gave up and ordered a new one, because it was described as using an AA battery.  New product uses the same unusual battery that I can't replace.  Won't buy again. Surprised by how non irritating this is. My skin has been bothering me lately. Menopause is the worst. Ran this over my cheeks and am happy with the results OI am disappointed..  does not work like I anticipated it would  keep going over and over  and still have facial hairsbummer. Its okay. Works fine. Takes little like longer to finish the job, than I would like. Have to go over and over same area to get a close shave. Worked great on the peach fuzz along my jaw line and the coarse dark hairs on my upper lip, chin, and neck. Wish I would have found this years ago and avoided all that bleaching, plucking, and embarrassment. Thought the light was frivolous, but it's great for illuminating the fine hairs you might miss under normal overhead room light.Can't give it 5 stars though, as I bought it in January 2020 and its already dying. Changed the battery twice with no difference. And I don't need to use it every day. So I've had to order a new one 10 months later. Testimony to how much I love it, though! I was not impressed with this trimmer.  Didn't get the job done by any stretch of the imagination. This is basically a shaver, and does not give a very close shave. Perhaps I didn‚Äôt read closely enough but this is like a shaver not an epilator. Hair is not removed, just cut, so you have to use it every other day. Hard growth comes and very sparse It‚Äôs okay.  It says it gets even the finest hairs. Well, it seems it mostly gets the finer hairs.  It doesn‚Äôt really get the thicker dark hairs that I was hoping it would.  It was worth the $15 I paid since I can‚Äôt go get any services during this pandemic.  But I would not buy it otherwise.  I‚Äôm not a person that wears foundation, so I wasn‚Äôt looking for an airbrush finish.  It may work great for that.  I also had a hard time using the circular motion it says to use.  My face is kind of moist, I don‚Äôt like to wait too long to moisturize after washing, so the tool didn‚Äôt glide. Second one over had Might as well use a razor would‚Äôve been 10X better than this piece of garbage, it‚Äôs hard to use it‚Äôs just aweful like moving it on the skin and it barely gets any hair! ITS HORRIBLE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY The head is always coming off when in use. I wanted this to work well (really wanted it to) but it didn‚Äôt. And unfortunately I waited too long and missed my return window. I also bought the one for eyebrows and had the same issue. It‚Äôs positives are that it is very easy to clean. Great for lip hair, only product that does not hurt my 8 year old or me. Sometimes I just use vaseline after if my skin is a little irritated. Then fine after. Only used it 2 times and it doesn't work. I waited to open it until right before a trip so now they say it's too late to return. Works great so far. doesn't  work!! it does the job but it will stop on you, it doesn't work steady it gets caught on the hair and stings, overall it does the job you just have to be patient with it, battery is tricky you think your battery is running out all the time, for the price its good enough Did not work, it was easy to use but did not remove hair. Returned This shaver is good for small areas and works well but doesn't get completely smooth on close shaved that have been previously shaved.The shaver gets close to completely smooth but not quit completely smooth. It's pretty to look at and easy to use. The top that holds the blade in keeps falling off as soon as I turn it on.  If I want to use it, I have to hold it on there while using.  Only had this a month and have to buy a new one. This hair remover really is as it describes---flawless.  I would go a step further and say that it also is very quiet and works well on my sensitive skin.  I am impressed that the battery is included, which saves an extra trip or internet search for a battery.  I opened the package, snapped in the battery and fired it up.  It cleaned the little hard-to-clean hairs from my chin, leaving my face smooth for a couple days at a time. (BTW, I also own the brow shaver and its ability to clean my brows prompted me to purchase this one).  I have used this shaver approximately for times in the past three days and am happy with the results.  It is my hope to keep it handy while traveling for those quick clean up of embarrassing fuzz on the chin and neck.  Furthermore, the lipstick shape is an ingenious delight. I cannot speak to the battery life yet but I hope the battery lasts a long time. Believe it or not, it  works. But of course like everything else in the USA, it was made in China. Seams fair priced, by today's market standards. That is it cost about 75 or 80 percent more than its worth. So we'll see how long it takes before it flies apart. The size is nice It was easy to use and had a long battery life but was not for my sensitive skin... it does not give you that smooth feel like my dermablade did. It made my skin break out pretty bad. I wish a would have took a pic. I had to stop using it and let my skin clear up for a couple of weeks and then go back to dermaplaning with my blade... Works well! Got this for my teen son to rid of his fuzzy mustache, works great but Im thinking once that fuzz turns to whiskers it might not work as well. But he has some time before that happens. This is nice so that he doesn't have to start shaving so soon. Not close to the skin at all, I tried it for little blonde peach fuzz and all it did was cut them shorter and irritate my skin.  I should have returned it.  Don't waste your money. Doesn‚Äôt work that well It‚Äôs no for sensitive skin It is perfect for facial hair. Battery lasts a long time. I wouldn't recommend using it on your bikini area. It gave me some serious bumps and ingrown hairs. Doesn‚Äôt cut as close as advertised. Clogs and doesn‚Äôt clean easily. Rendered useless in less than a year."
26,"Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands with Instruction Guide and Carry Bag, Set of 5",Sports and Outdoors,"While the loops are sturdy, they roll too easily. When these loops roll, the loops sticks to itself making it into a vary narrow band that cuts into your legs. I've had to stop work outs to move the bands down and re-adjust. Disappointing purchase. These are perfect for my needs as I heal from knee surgery. They are short which constrains the application and usefulness Good quality. I ordered to help me hold my hips still during strength exercises and all of the bands twisted and rolled up during exercises making it painful. Today was the first time I used these at the gym with my bf and I can already see two little holes. They don't look like they're going to last me a long time. I like them and they are inexpensive, but the Red resistance band broke after only 10 uses.  The black one is still working well, but the resistance on the other three is too low to provide me any benefit. They roll up entirely too much.  Waste of money. I honestly can't say how restatement they are because they kept rolling up. I bought these last year, and all but one have melted just from being in my living room. The last one I have just rolls right up, so I spend half my exercise time trying to unroll them, and the other half cursing them for rolling while I exercise. Very small and snap easily Arrived Broken.  The pictures are deceiving.  Low quality. The yellow band broke and shot across the room on first use. Garbage Recommended by my PT.  I can‚Äôt comment on their durability as I‚Äôve just started using them.  However, my Physical Therapist said they sell 1 band for $7 and this was five for $4.97.  I brought them with me to therapy and he said they were good. Solid quality... I think if there is anything that one can whine about this product would be the color.  Maybe someone would like cuter colors I guess. These things are quite useless. They have little to no resistance. Great to be able to choose amongst resistances, but these bands ripped within six months. Terrible construction. These loops are very large. At 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 130 pounds the point of resistance begins at almost full extension. Would not recommend for smaller/average builds. They definitely work, only thing is they tend to slip down your thighs/legs easily. The first use, two out of the five bands popped. I contacted the seller before leaving a negative review as they instructed in the packaging so they can resolve any issues.  I have not heard back from them. So I can give one star for the product and their customer service. Don't waste your money. Very light band popped almost instantly when use by my daughter. The other bands are holdup up well so far. Is helping my husband rehabilitate These are nice, but all are very light. I am not sure if this is just a personal preference or not, but I would like them to be a but heavier. I liked the fact that the bands went from easy to harder. They are excellent for me to use at home while trying to get stronger. Was just doing leg extensions and the heavy band snapped completely and went flying across the room. That sucks. Plus these don‚Äôt stay put and roll up constantly. Good selection of weights, seems well made Unfortunately my 'heavy' band snapped within just a few uses, so I cannot recommend this product. Cheap product.  Couple of bands began loosing elasticity in less that 2 months of use.  One band snapped in 6 weeks. Worth the money & does what it‚Äôs supposed to I've bought this set twice and believe they are as good as any I've had (although the fabric style are more durable - and more expensive).  Good range of power rating. These things roll up horribly. I would suggest you go for something with a higher quality. Quality isn‚Äôt the best but I was happy to be supporting a family business. Feels like a wide rubber band and I do feel scared using it I.e. it might snap. I love that it wasn't expensive yet can be used for all kinds of things.  I have been using them to strengthen my side to side flexibility and open my hips.  Working with a trainer with them and now have my own. Cute but not for plus size women . They roll down my legs . The different levels. These broke easily and were not big enough to use for a variety of exercises. It‚Äôs too late to return them, or I would. Working on weight loss and exercises.  I gave one to my daughter too, and she loves it. The bands are useful for what I need from them. I do wish that the extra-heavy band was a bit stronger for my purposes; but again, I am getting what I want from them. Regular there were too many 'light"" resistance bands- keep in mind these bands are typically used for legs, the strongest part of your body.  there should be more challenging bands AND they should be wider.  i don't think they'll last very long but they were worth the price. arrived promptly, jaded for hip abductions mainly,. Works well, doesn‚Äôt snap. Not durable, wears out very quick They work decently, but they roll it was okay. These bands fold and hurt when doing certain exercises like squats. I wanted some bands that would not role up. These seemed sturdy, unfortunately they kept rolling up. I returned them and bought another material and brand. Very good elastic band set durable the light to medium is really light but the heavy and extra heavy are really good overall great buy I use it every day, I really recommend. Very flimsy, would keep folding up on me. Didn‚Äôt last long Couldn‚Äôt even make it thru squats with it rolling Versatile & travel friendly! I ordered these when Covid hit and I couldn't go to the gym. They were perfect.  Now I have my own set when I go to Pilates or yoga, so I don't have to worry about viruses.  I like having different strengths, too. These bands are not for anyone with any kind of muscles on their legs.  As soon as I put them on, they rolled up. Not wide enough they hurt my hands when  they curl up, so I will have to find a better grade of resistance bands Perfectly what I expected The silicone bands are not the way to go. They slide around and bundle up it feels like a rubber band around your legs. 0/10 Great quality wish I had read reviews before I bought these!  The second time I used the light one it broke!  The first time it took forever to untwist it.  Not worth the money.  Can I return these? Perfect for at home exercising for the wife and kids. These don't last over time. Two have broken, the lighter ones still to themselves and don't lay flat, and all of them roll up too frequently during the workout. Some of the lighter bands have no range of motion. N/a Very thin..... I don‚Äôt anticipate these lasting long.  Not easy to use these roll up and dig in.  Unrolling is almost impossible I prefer elastic bands over these. Just what we needed to add to our personal gym! Way too small! Sending these to goodwill. They are worth the money you pay but I think that they are thin. I was afraid they would Bree but they seem to be very strong. Only used them one, but I found them annoying because they seem to roll up easily. These bands have been great for increasing the difficulty of my workouts, but I have problems with the bands rolling. One band broke the first time I used itüëé I needed these to help with the weight loss program I am on Rubber bands have their place but for glut workouts they roll a lot... all rubber bands will. So if you still want rubber bands these are solid ! They sent you a selection of bands but they‚Äôre only a foot long may be a little bit more you can‚Äôt use that very well I use that to build my shoulders up one and one and one in the other and stretch it across so the bands do have different degrees of tightness on them but they‚Äôre too small for me I needed something more durable looking Not at all what I expected.  They are thin and plastic... I'll use them as until I can replace. Resistance bands are perfect for your workout. The different levels help with choosing which resistance you need for each exercise. Good product for resistance training and increasing speed and agility. Nice bag  to keep all the bands in and make it easy to keep together and travel with. Nice workout card included. I was really excited to use these bands. They come with different resistances and are great for a variety of workouts. However I‚Äôm running into issues when I‚Äôm using them around my thighs while wearing leggings. I imagine this would happen with any other long pants that have an athletic material. They slide up and down my thighs and don‚Äôt stay where I need them to be. If you will mainly use them around your thighs, invest in fabric bands that don‚Äôt slip or roll. They roll a lot which is uncomfortable... im constantly readjusting the bands every couple of minutes which is annoying my workouts. If you‚Äôre looking for good resistance bands, get wider ones that wont roll so easily I bought this to try to reabilitate my shoulder from an injury. It seems to be working well. I bought these to use at the gym around my thighs while doing different exercises for toning my butt. They are nowhere near resistant enough. I‚Äôm using the heaviest one and it does nothing. Wonderful beginner bands, durable and perfect for a variety of exercises. Enjoying the carrying bag they came in. They do what they need to do... cause my muscles to burn. Assisting in my fit self journey! If you need a set of bands, these are as good as any. Keeps sliding off my legs. But other than that it does the job. To thin Too flimsy,  broke on first use. They worked like I needed but could not use due to the strong smell of the material Grandson loves these. This was exactly what I was looking for. The red band broke after only a few months use. Trying a second set to see if the first was a fluke. They are easy to use. Mine cane used -.- Don't buy this product.  The bands do not sit right.  Felt like rubber bands cutting off my circulation.  You totally get what you pay for with this product. The heavy band started developing a rip after a few weeks, so I stopped using it. If you're reasonably strong, the lighter bands will be of no use to you, but these are great for people who work at home or aren't able to do more intense workouts with gym equipment. Don't waste your money. The X-light tore after only a few uses. I was only using it hand-to-hand, no contact with the floor or a post. Very small and cheap. Most of these bands are too weak for me to use. What I would *like* to have is 10 black bands (highest strength), because over time they all lose their strength. Instead I have to buy a lot of weak bands to get the one I want, which is a shame. When the one band gets too weak, I now have to replace the whole set. These will work if you're new to working out but they don't provide the same amount of resistance as some other brands. Very durable. Slightly flimsy and a little too wide.. I love mine! I broke my ankle recently, the bands have been great for therapy exercises. We have used them for over a month and they work fine. They come in nice colors. At first I thought I was doing something wrong because it kept rolling up my thigh but then I realized I just wasn‚Äôt ready for that strength of band so if you‚Äôre like me and a beginner this pack is great because it has all the different sizes/strengths of bands! They work good while they work, but eventually ( quickly ) develop tears. You'll then need to cut them in half and figure out how to use them. After that, they develop tears again, and eventually break. I got these July 28, two are now broken on August 18 ( the heaviest two ). 2 stars only because they worked pretty well while I had them. Totally what I need fir improving my range of motion. I am pretty happy with these. After a few weeks, they are pretty sticky and have to unstick them a couple times during each use.  Decent for the price though. They do provide resistance, but they bunch up and twist and it hurts to use them. They don't lie flat. I don't recommend. Good deal Not durable material sucks Left them in my car with the rest of my gym stuff and didn‚Äôt use them for a couple months. Broke them out and 2 were stuck together, like melted together, and the others I tried to use and they snapped like a fresh piece of gum. They don't stay in place and roll really badly. Rolls up when doing thigh extension exercises. I haven‚Äôt put all of my trust in the bands. They are on the thinner side and I would HATE if one of those boys popped on me. So far so good though. If you just started to do exercises this could be a good for you, but if you are already use to do workouts this is not tight enough, even the X HARDER These rolls with your work out. They're a little flimsy. But they work. Terrible products. Very very small can‚Äôt get it around most areas and super cheap plastic that rolls up when even using once. Trust me, don‚Äôt waste your money I ended up returning Price was good but now i know why.  Not enough resistance....not even the X-Heavey one. I really had high hopes for these, because of the ratings. But now I wished that I had looked at the reviews instead. These definitely roll, atleast when you have them around your legs. They definitely don‚Äôt feel as durable as they claim. I would not at all recommend, and would suggest paying more money for a better quality. Not sure what that is yet, but hoping I find better ones. Great concept of making it travel friendly, but other than that I don‚Äôt think these work. They are cute and they work but they aren‚Äôt very good quality. If you use them for work outs they will break quickly. They're useful for light stretching resistance at best. Thin and flimsy.  Difficult to use because they are so lightweight they tend to curl up.  The heavier bands are better but overall not useful. The with is sooo skinny they fold if they are up higher thank calf muscles The x-light band broke the first time I used it. I was trying to adjust the position on my legs and trying to adjust the band because it kept rolling up. The light one hasn‚Äôt broken, and I haven‚Äôt tried the others yet. These band roll down and it made it really uncomfortable to do the workouts. i like these bands and they definitely work, i wish they were a little wider bc they do tend to roll into themselves when in use horrible quality‚Ä¶I knew this is an expendable products, but I already got two broke up in just two months. I am sure they were not heavily used, probably 2 times per week... definitely don‚Äôt recommend, don‚Äôt waste your money! I have these for about 6 months now. I only use the red and black. Occasionally I use the yellow for arms. I, so far had no issues. Yes, the lightweight ones do roll up. The heavier ones less and it really depends on the exercise. To avoid rolling as well as to improve some excercises I use different heavy bands for legs. None of them snapped on me yet. I do make sure to put some baby powder on them so they don‚Äôt stick. Be careful of asbestos in baby powder. Try getting those based on cornstarch rather than talc Much smaller and more limiting than I expected. They won‚Äôt be much use for me. Great product. Purchased to add variety and build strength from an injury. Great for physical therapy as well. Very durable. Great addition to my at home  fitness regimen. I like the assortment of different resistance. Use it for an array of workouts üí™ üòè. honestly horrible! do not purchase. they are practically all the some weight. there is no resistance at all. if you want something with no resistance definitely get this Not great not bad Too narrow, it scrunches/rolls up when I have them around my legs during work outs. The various resistance weights to each band is nice. Ok Bands definitely add to the quality of my workout but I wish the bands would not roll and would stay in place I use this product for simply workouts in the morning, it is great for warm ups. Great quality and like the fact that each color band is labeled with its resistance level.  Bands are very versatile. So, the product is great, and I like them, but my complaint is that the 5 different bands all feel the same. I‚Äôm not super strong but I can use the extra heavy without a problem. It feels the same as the light. I should have bought the better quality product. I felt like I was getting a good deal with 5 bands, but I really only got 1 because they‚Äôre all so similar. They came right on time. They‚Äôve been a great addition to my workout routine. My only problem is the ‚Äúlight‚Äù resistance band snapped when I tried it These bands are functional and I use them because it's all that I have, but they smell bad like rubber when you first get them and they slip on skin so easily. I honestly do not like them at all. They are too flimsy and just roll every time you move. does not stretch much as I thought. I hope it does not break if you use it carefully. Not useful for bigger thighs."
27,"Fitbit Charge 4 Fitness and Activity Tracker with Built-in GPS, Heart Rate, Sleep & Swim Tracking, Black/Black, One Size (S &L Bands Included)",Sports and Outdoors,"I bought this item in February brand new. It is July, and the band is broken beyond repair. Do not buy a Fitbit. It is not a quality product. The watch has trouble syncing to a mobile device. I had a charge 2 for a couple of years with no problems.I purchased the charge 4 based on that reliability only to have it stop working after 1 month.I put it on one morning and the screen was blank.After going through their recovery process it still did not work.Don't buy a charge 4.  They aren't built to last and warranty replacement takes 2 weeks and you have to pay minimum $16.00 for shipping. Charger does not work! Fitbit is great IF you can get the charger to connect and charge! Works very well. Tracks my sleep. Very happy with my purchase! Works as intended Does exactly what expected. Easy to set up. It broke and now I can't use it very disappointed in how easy it broke. If it's for working out you would think it would be stronger and last longer then a year very upset with it. I was really excited to finally purchase and receive a fitness tracker. However my short experience with it ended up being quite disappointing since ultimately I returned it. Here I document the reasons.  I immediately charged and started wearing the Fitbit Versa 4 which I picked up for the discounted price of $99 instead of the $129. I was really interested in seeing how well it would track my biking and kayaking. It doesn't seem to really do very well with tracking those two activities (there in no dedicated kayaking workout tracker). Other features weren't any better, the sleep tracking and SpO2 monitoring were something I was looking forward to seeing how well they worked. Total disappointment! The sleep tracking seemed incapable of accurately tracking how much I slept always shortchanging by several hours or not indicating any sleep at all. Of the ten days I wore the tracking the SpO2 gave me one day's reading. Seems Fitbit's ability to track these things is quite limited and totally lacks accuracy. Worse yet the last night I was wearing the device I woke up in the middle of the night with a burning sensation on my arm right under where the sensor is located. I immediately took it off and never wore it again after that. However even though I never wore it again I had a phantom sensation of it being on my arm for the next week which has only just now subsided. I truly question the safety of a device that first burn my arm and then leaves a phantom sensation behind for day on end after being removed. Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Now 6 months later the cheap plastic hook (part of the actual unit) that holds the wristband on is broken.  I guess I will join the many others and contact warranty service and wait.  Read the reviews about the broken part that attaches the wristband and I bet you will keep shopping.  Wish I had researched more. I don‚Äôt find the added features all that helpful for me. Sleep tracking is my primary interest; then there is a stress monitoring-I don't know how they determine that number. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt buy the Apple watch: Next upgrade. Part that goes into wrist band broke already.  Also under exercise doesn‚Äôt have free weights like 3 does. is there really no way to replace the clip fo the band ? this is ridiculous. Replaced my aging Charge 2 for this junk. It doesn't keep accurate data, no sleep date working, poor pulse rate.  I wish my Charge 2 was still working properly cause this thing is awful.  I gotta look for something better now.  Sleep mode is really terrible Sleep tracking is addictive I upgraded from my charge 2 to a charge 4.  Big mistake.  It worked for a month, stopped just after return window closed. It tracks my walks...when it wants to.  Wont sync with the app. I have tried everything, Uninstaller both tracker and app. Reinstalled.  Updated both phone and fitbit. Turned Bluetooth off and on. I  give up . I will never buy another fitbit. Waste of money and no support Reading is not bright enough. It doesn't light up when needed The font in the Charge 4 is too small to read. I bought the Charge 4 as a replacement for my Charge 2, which unfortunately stopped notifying me of calls and texts. The new charge 4 does indeed give me notifications however they are useless because I can‚Äôt read them. Very disappointed Is good but wish the o2 was tracked all day rather than just when sleeping After the last update can't control settings like brightness or when it turns on when you turn your wrist.  Essentially a really expensive mediocre watch and pedometer now.  Don't waste your $ My fiance went swimming with it on and it no longer works now, under 6 months old. I love the design but the display os dim,in sunlight Although it looks the same as the Fitbit Charge 3 and claims to be more advanced, it doesn't seem to be as dependable in its tracking.  Some of the features don't track at all and the regular ones, i.e, sleep and even steps don't always register.  The battery is advertised as lasting about a week and that isn't true either. i had to pay 18.17 in return fees ..... not happy at all! Unfortunately there were three problems: 1. the watch kept unsyncing from my device; 2. the straps would detach too easily‚Ä¶.both things I decided to live with even though a bit frustrating. Finally (3) the little piece that hooks onto the strap broke, making the watch unwearable.  Disappointed to have thrown money away. I was hopeful. Really disappointed in this product. Had a Charge 3 that had durability problems.  Bought a Charge 4 and the Screen has a giant dead spot after 3 days of using it. Very poor Bluetooth connection. I never had issues with Bluetooth connection when I had charge 3. Doesn‚Äôt count steps accurately The steps calorie and floor counts are so inaccurate that u can't really get any value out of them .But at 99 bucks guess it's okay to atleast track against ones own history . I am so bummed. I had a Fitbit Alta that died after many years, so I orded the Charge4. I have loved it, but it suddenly went dim and would no longer display when raising my arm after only 2 months. What a pain! With your hands full, you can't see what time it is. I have a small wrist, so I don't know where to go from here. I love the watch and its features.  Unfortunately, there is a design flaw that results in the watch flying off my wrist whenever I golf.  I returned the first one, purchased another and experienced the same issues.  Fitbit customer service admits that an issue exists. I cannot recommend this product to any golfer.  It's an awful feeling to look at your wrist and discover that your Fitbit is missing.  I was blessed to have found it on the golf course each time, but that's not the proper experience.Update: Exchanged for a Versa 2 and am exceedingly pleased! I have only had this fitbit since January of 2021.  I hadn't had any problems with it until recently.  THe fitbit itself will not stay latched to my wristband.  I thought it might be the wristband but it isn't.  There is one piece of the fitbit that is very loose and that's why it won't stay on.  I was hoping to get an even exchange BUT it's too late.  I  had to do it in March.  That's redicilious.  I might switch to a different brand after this. Bought this thinking it would be THE best... but DAMN it is glitchy, clunky to operate, unreliable GPS and just not good for what everybody raves about. Tried to update the SpO2 clock face and it freezes... had to unistall and reinstall to no avail. Still not working. Over it. This product was a piece of junk.  It stopped charging after about three times.  The extended service plan never arrived I am sadly disappointed with this fit bit Use this product. Mostly for steps and miles. I owned this product for about one month and so far I am very satisfied. I particularly like the idea of the battery lasting 6-7 days without a charge I purchased this FitBit 5 months ago.  I have worn it constantly, other than to charge it.  I anticipate the buzz to tell me how I'm doing and to congratulate me on my progress.  That has been great. Just recently, however, it is quiet: not giving me the ""buzz"" warning about my hourly 250 steps or telling me I completed my goals.  I question the accuracy of my stair climbs, which are often overstated!  Now the clock face is sometimes so dim that I can't read the time, and sometimes it illuminates clearly.  I guess I've ""worn it out."" SpO2 tracking is accurateSleep and weather data are not promptly provided.  I gave up and returned it for another brand. I did not like waking up and having to wait hours to find out my sleep data.  Often the current weather conditions would be hours old or not available.  After multiple conversations with technical support, nothing was fixed for me I was super excited for this device to track my swim laps. I used it while swimming, and it immediately lost the charge. Now it charges to 100%, and is dead withing five minutes. Has been weeks since the initial day it happened, and it still will not hold a charge. Had it for one day, and it is ruined forever, because I used it for something it says I can, but clearly they are wrong. I own a couple of them and absolutely love them.  However, these are not ideal for grandparents, especially if they are not tech savvy.  It‚Äôs the only reason why I gave it a 4 star.  Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great product, but just wasn‚Äôt the right one for my parents who are in their 80‚Äôs.  Got them something less complicated (on Amazon) that they absolutely LOVE. I don't think its all that accurate. I bought this one for the pulse monitor. But its always much much higher then my pulse oximeter. I haven‚Äôt used the sleep tracking function so I didn‚Äôt rate that capability.  All you need for a good price.  Also serves as a good alternative to my dress watch for casual outings. It was very hard to connect the fitbit Charge 4 to my samsung phone even though it was on the list of phones that are compatible.  It took 6 days. Boy, I had no idea how effective this new Fitbit Charge 4 would be at helping me rack up the steps!  Apparently all I have to do is sleep and BAM! the steps just keep coming and coming! 40,000 steps one night!  50,000 steps another! And the badges! Oh my gosh, the badges! I must have set some kind of record given how quickly I got all three ""Minions"" Badges, then the ""Cleats"" badge, let's see, the ""Redwood Forest"" badge, and the ""Snow Boot"" badge.  Landed the ""Cowboy boot"" badge just by walking downstairs to get my morning coffee!  YEE-HAW, indeed!And try as they might, none of the Fitbit Help Desk folks can take those steps away from me!  One of them even told me to try to ""change the designation of the steps you've received into a car ride instead,"" but that won't work because I didn't get these steps during a designated exercise like ""running"" or ""walking""!  Nope, they just came to me! These steps are mine, baby!  And no one, and I mean no one can take them away!  No matter how hard they try!So after about three months when the Charge4 wouldn't even function as a watch anymore because it wouldn't light up fully when I rotated my wrist to look at it, I just set it on the shelf! And guess what?!  Yup!  More steps!  AMAZING! I wonder if I'll keep earning badges now that the Charge4 is at the recycling center?!  Who wants to bet?!  Best hundred and thirty bucks I ever spent! Overall I like this fitbit a lot. I bought the slightly smaller one accidentally and gave it to my niece. The larger one is still pretty small. It remind me a lot of 'palm pilots' that came out way back when before smart phones were really a thing. It has a lot of functionality but its a little clunky and monochromatic etc. I have concerns about the bands as it did not want to stay fastened right away but after a couple of weeks it's hanging in there (needed to use the larger band that comes with it). It will make you aware of whether you are moving around or being a lump...that's for sure. Was using an Apple Watch for several months.  I like this better. Product defective. Vibrates uncontrollably, cannot restart. Due to malfunction, battery dies in a day. Went on vacation and missed my return window so now I'm stuck with defective materials. The band broke after a couple weeks, got some new ones and all is well. Although it was hard to see the steps (small print), I thought it was not a bad smartwatch. However when I tried to swipe to record a walk, I could never get that track to appear. Of course, it would appear a random times when I did not need it. I purchased this in March. It is now July and it has quit working. Doesn't track steps anymore. It worked great while it lasted but I‚Äôm quite frustrated because it wasn‚Äôt cheap! Generally I like this device. It sits very high aka the actual devise is quite thick. I bought this version because I have small wrists and didn't want to be overpowered by a large device. I'm not sure this is fitting that desire. Since this device was advertised for sleep tracking I thought it might save me from wearing my oximeter sleeve on my finger when sleeping to track my oxygen (O2) saturation. This Fitbit does not measure O2 concentration in the blood so I returned it. If you don't have problems with breathing when sleeping such as sleep apnea you may not need oximetry measurements and this device may meet your needs. connector that holds the band on broke after 5 months of use. This is my first Fitbit and I love it, I have had it for about 3 months now. The only draw back is I keep having to restart it or reset heart rate as it stops reading frequently when exercising. I have large wrists so the original band does not work out to well so I had to get an adjustable elastic band that works pretty good most of the time but it‚Äôs already time for a new band. The best part of this product is being able to see how many calories you burn vs what you actually take in. When I got this band I was 315 and now I‚Äôm down to 290. It helps me stay motivated to eat better and exercise more even though I have a sedentary job. Very happy with the progress. I only wish Fitbit made better bands for guys with large wrists. The app is great and helps you track your progress. I gave this to my wife because she was having trouble sleeping and wanted to know how much sleep she was getting.  She loved it at first, however, it is less than six months and if has stopped reporting sleep patterns, we have not loaded any other software so we don't know about that ease of use with other features. It also goes dead after about two to three days so she is always packing the charging cord with her.She also complains about it wanting her to work out and sets a timer that she has to fugit to shut off. loved the fitbit its march 31 and its broken the band snapped off and i can't repair it tried to glue the band  an i can't return it so it lasted 3 months for 100.00 dollars It doesn‚Äôt charge properly yeah after failed to charge this Fitbit EVERY TIME except for the first 3 times.  I have to come here and leave a bad review. I went back to using my old Charge 3 after purchasing this. Even with different techniques of wearing it, the charge 4 would not pick up my heart rate. Have owned a Fitbit Blaze for years but recently it began having sync issues forcing me to shutdown and reboot the blaze everyday to get it to sync so I thought I would give this a try.  At this price point you would be hard pressed to find a better fitness tracker.  It works with the app perfectly and have noticed zero issues.  It is physically smaller and less intrusive than the blaze and seems to provide a more ergonomically correct fit to the wrist than the Blaze.  The only thing I miss is the ""active minutes"" but I am sure that the ""in zone"" function will eventually fill this hole.  I do not care that the display is not color because the touch screen is so responsive and intuitive.  This really checks all the blocks for me.  Probably won't use the GPS much but it is nice to have.  Like all other trackers, I expect this to provide only ballpark HR and other information.  Very highly recommended. I bought this mainly for heart rate monitoring during workouts and have been very disappointed with this feature. It is highly inconsistent and often cuts out during workouts while every once in a while working well. I‚Äôve tried every position and tip I‚Äôve read with no change in the functionality of this feature. I had a Charge 2 for several years.  It was reliable and durable.  The face was cracked and I went through several bands but it was a great device.This device took over 10 attempts to connect to my phone.  (It was more like 20-30 after the 'customer support')  It is useless until it connects.  To boot, the customer assistance does (for all intents and purposes) not exist.  It your phone cannot connect, then just keep trying.  I finally connected after almost two days.Once it connects the interface is ok.  It seems like they are trying to make it fancy instead of functional.  A great user interface is an indication of a genius interface engineer.  This feels like a committee designed it.I am still early in the ownership of this device and I will probably come to love it, but if the difference between the Charge 2 and the Charge 4 is any indication, I will not be upgrading in the future.  Great companies make great products and continually improve them.  Less than great companies take great products and obfuscate them to the dustbin of history.  I believe that Fitbit is moving in the dustbin direction.If you get this as a gift for someone, please expect that person may not talk to you for the first few days after receiving their new gift.  Rest assured they may thank you later. The display doesn't work properly and app is also not that good.. Was expecting much better product for 100 bucks.. I had a Fitbit previously that I could track my steps while walking. This face is so dark that I can't keep track of my steps until I am in the shade or return to the house. So disappointed I love fitbit trackers. They are cheap, fast and way better than the Google Wear OS watches. The battery life is also great and it lasts about a week.If you have a nickel allergy make sure you buy a hypoallergenic band for this. Guaranteed rashes. It's too bad because I like the original band. Removed 1 star for my fellow nickel haters. I love my Charge 4. Works great for tracking my movements and as a daily wrist watch. This watch was ok. I have had it for about 4 months. If you are a water sports person, DO NOT PURCHASE. I am a rower and a raft guide and I think the regular exposure to water broke down the glue leading the plastic to snap off. The heart rate monitor was rarely accurate. I reached out to Fitbit to troubleshoot and they were not much help. Finally, last week I was on an overnight rafting trip and the watch seemed to be working fine besides the broken strap that I had glued back together. I woke up one morning and found it wouldn‚Äôt turn on even after charging it and there was water inside the area that monitors heart rate. I think if you are someone just looking for a decent watch to encourage you to get active this is a good watch. If you are an athlete that needs accurate readings or work around water then best to avoid this watch. A few times this new Fitbit has given me a sleep score, that was pretty cool. Unfortunately, it was only a few times. I believe it was supposed to sync with MyFitnessPal, but it didn‚Äôt do that either. Yes, I followed the directions.I‚Äôm not too thrilled with this Fitbit, but it does keep the correct time and it counts my steps. Oh well‚Ä¶ This is one of the best trackers for the price.  The dim screen though makes it useless if you need to read it outdoors often. I wanted something more simple. Too complicated, too many functions. Only needed to track steps, heart rate, and time. Also not paying monthly bill for functions. Lost and found old simple fitbit. Returned. Not good for older people. Could not set it up to work properly. This is the 4th Fitbit that I have owned. Seem to last for about a year. Last one only lasted 6 months and I had to return to Costco which accepted return with no problem. Love Costco.  Problem was that you could read screen indoors but not outdoors. Also previous tracker had spo2 monitor but this one doesn‚Äôt or at least I can‚Äôt locate it. No big deal as didn‚Äôt seem too accurate. Like that it has sleep tracking and heart monitoring. Only downside is you need to have fitbit premium to use all the features. This is a great idea that was poorly implemented.  I bought this based on a review that found it to be one of the most accurate sleep cycle trackers, and it does seem to do a very good job on that.  However, the rest seems to be rushed to production and not-quite finished.Pros: Excellent sleep trackingCons: GPS is weak, and loses signals while on runs out in the open in areas where my 10-year old Garmin never does.Smart alarm does not work reliably.  This is designed to wake you during periods of light sleep, and when it does work it has a noticeable effect.  However, it regularly (but unpredictably) fails to go off, making the alarm feature useless.Data analysis is skewed towards marketing, not information.  The Charge4 will actually collect a fair amount of data overnight that you cannot get access to without subscribing to the Premium service.Conclusion: It was a mistake for me, but I'll keep it for sleep tracking and go back to my Garmin Forerunner225 for running and exercising. Already issues with GPS and automatically switching screens for no reason.  Had a Charge 2 or 3 for years with no issues but this is not good at all. UPDATE. I complained on their Instagram and they blocked me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The band broke in two months. I requested a replacement. The support team said ‚Äúthey have a lot of complaints and they have no idea when will they sent me one‚Äù. Stay away of this low quality product This is my 4th fitbit and no doubt my last.  it is difficult to use and almost impossible to see outside.  this is a charge 4 and i really thought they would have addressed this by now since it's not a new issue.  I have difficulty swiping to use the features. Not a great watch. Does not provide consistent measurement of distances traveled on the map, actual steps taken appear to be accurate. Everyday I walk the same 4 mile course along a straight road, out and back, same starting place same turning point for the return trip. Worked for a week tracking same distance everyday with little variation. Now its all over the place, sometimes logging half the distance, seeming to arbitrarily decide where the turnaround point is. I liked it for a week. It has a nice display and interacted well with my iphone. Then it started miscounting the number of flights of stairs I climbed - always over counting. Then it starting creating floors that didn't exist . It showed 10 to 20 on days I never went up stairs. I checked in the Fitbit Charge community and this is a common problem. The response from Fitbit on the sites was that temperature change, wind, closing a car door, the moon in Venus' quadrant, pretty much anything can cause the Fitbit to count mythical stairs, perhaps several hundred a day. I didn't like the Charge so much that I was willing to accept this large flaw. It was also annoying that it likes to hide data, like minute to minute heartrate and the oxygen saturation.  So back it went. CANNOT SEE IN THE SUN, DOES NOT MATTER WHAT YOU SET IT TO.YOU STILL CANT SEE IN THE SUN. I like it!  2nd one.  Every once in a while it doesn't track my sleep right but otherwise it works pretty good with all other measurements.  It isn't too large either and i like that.  Other types of bands are available too (on line). I am pretty happy, overall, with the Fitbit Charge 4 - it logs my steps, heartrate, etc, very well.  Not so much with my sleep patterns.  For example, one night I slept only about 3.5 hours, very restless, and the Charge 4 showed that I slept for 10 hours.  Seriously?  I understand a little discrepancy, but not that much.Also, for anyone considering the Charge 4 as an upgrade from the Charge 3 - the bands DO fit, contrary to the advertised info.  The Charge 4 band was very stiff and uncomfortable, but after changing it to a cloth band I had on my Charge 3 - it's perfect! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as accurate as the polar hr monitor with chest strap but it kept me motivated. But within 60 days, it would no longer charge. Pretty expensive bracelet for 60 day use I had a Fitbit before with another phone. It started having connection problems after a year. Thrown away since the warranty was expired. Fair enough.This one had pairing malfunctions since day one.After a few weeks of troubleshooting and the problem insisting I returned it for a refund. Both my phone's where LG and new at the moment.I assume it's poor quality on the part of Fitbit until proven otherwise. I liked my Fitbit 3 way better I wasn't sure how much I would really use a Tracker like this, it is the first one I've had. The app is great and has a lot of features that can help you track your food and water intake, sleep patterns, exercise patterns and more. The app is very easy to use, and there are a ton of features that are usable right from your wrist on the tracker itself. This is a great all-in-one tracker like a more expensive watch type tracker, but for way less! Hrv is ineffective. Like how it looks and it has a good battery life. My first Fitbit had features which Fitbit is now charging extra for.  If I'm not mistaken, other fitness bands provide the same information that Fitbit charges an extra monthly fee for.  I meant to return this band, but let the return window pass.  My bad. I love my Fitbit but because previous experience I immediately ordered a new wrist band. I've never understood why they keep selling them with the bands that provide very little to no breathability. I followed manufacturer's recommendations on care but my wrist always develops a rash where the band suffocates the  my skin. The aftermarket wrist band I bought works wonderfully and my skin has healed while I have been wearing it. If you have any degree of sensitive skin I recommend getting a woven wrist band.The app is straight forward but the premium membership could use some work for the price. There's quite as bit of content available just not much variety once you realize how the  content is set in up. It could really use a search option and a more straightforward way to find previously viewed videos, articles, etc. The FitBit app in the Windows Store does not work with the Charge 4.  Very disappointing. I wouldn't move if I didn't have accountability. Fitbit helps me motivate! 5 stars!!!!! This is the second fitbit that I have purchased, both have ended up with broken bands that cannot be fixed. I love the app but I wonder how accurate it is. It really inspires me to move around and rack up those zone minutes and steps! I wanted a fitness tracker more than a smart watch and went from an Apple Watch to this. Many advertised features are not available unless you also purchase a ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù account. This is basically not as advertised. This will be the last Fitbit that I buy. I've had a Fitbit One for years and it tracked steps really well, but had issues syncing since the beginning so I decided it was time to try a new one. I purchased this 3 months ago after watching a number of Youtube reviews and deciding that, for the price, this was a good option for step tracking, exercise and HR measurement. It isn't.Pros:-Very good sleep tracking-Fairly good step tracking (my Fitbit ONE is still more accurate here)-The Fitbit app is very good now.Cons:-Bluetooth is still really flaky. Its not my devices. Its the same bad sync performance in Win 10 and Android. I have to reset Bluetooth on my phone and re-pair every few weeks. When the app can't sync, it gives a ""Fix This"" option that  just takes you to the troubleshooting web site. After this many years, they should be better at this.-Heart Rate is all over the place. I'll do a 45 min workout, and for no reason, the HR will spike to 150 for a minute or so, then settle back down to normal (130ish). On occasion, I review my workouts in the app and just see alot of random spikes in HR. This just throws off my calories and avg HR. I've tried adjusting the band looser and tighter and up and down my wrist. I can't seem to find a ""good"" spot.-THE SPOTIFY APP! Some programmer really ****ed this up. If you are in exercise mode, the one thing you CANNOT do is use Spotify. ?? Well that's stupid. Its like, the only time I want to use the Spotify app is when I'm exercising.-No always on option for the display. I get real tired of flinging my wrist around trying to get it to wake up.Next time, I'll try another brand fitness tracker. If I could give it no stars I would!I got it really for notifications, which worked for the first week and hasn't worked since and I have had it for a month and a half.I got a new phone a week ago, I forgot password and requested to reset, I'm still waiting for the email üò§Save your money and get something consistent This watch got my husband walking. He is determined to read his daily goal. After 3 weeks...Time dial now has blank lines in the digits. You can't see the entire time anymore. Harder to use than older versions I had the AltaHr before this for 2 yeassband decided it was time to upgrade. I waited for the Black Friday sale and got mine for about $50 cheaper than usual! I‚Äôve had it for just over two months now and really love it. Heart rate tracking is important to me since it motivates me when I see calories burned from a work out. I know it may not be 100% accurate but I know it‚Äôs within the ballpark and that makes me happy.Just like the previous fitbits it sets reminders for you to get up and walk. Working from home, i can forgot easily to get up and stretch my legs so this really helps me stay on track.I really love FitBit products and I say maybe wait for the next sale (I think they have them often) if you are on the fence. The wrist strap does not securely fasten to watch and lost my watch after two days.Fitbit, you need to  fix this Very low quality compared to the charge4.It is cheap flimsy plastic that feels like it will break if any impact occurs.I do not understand how this cheap peice of plastic goes for 200$ new.My xiaomi mi band was only 60$ has more features, better build quality, and better battery life. Save your money and go with a better product. Fitbit used to be great but is just greedy low quality products now. I tried switching from my old Garmin vivoactive HR watch. Having  so used to Garmin‚Äôs software interface, Fitbit app looks primitive.It works most of the time but having to pay monthly for additional sleep tracking analytics is not good. Step counts were inflated and the battery life was disappointing. Just what i ordered.  Super fast shipping, packaged great.  Easy set up and so far its working perfect. Needs to be better for 5 stars but still really good and worth the price. I have been using it for a few months now. It is a bit uncomfortable to wear specially while sleeping, i have to take it off. Another thing i felt was its heart beat tracker is not as accurate. It tracks heartbeat for even non living things which is weird. Step tracking is good. Usually iphone and band shows almost similar reading. Sleep tracking is just fine. Sometimes when i am awake‚Ä¶ it shows as sleep. Have used this for 30 days. Now it won‚Äôt charge. I used a power strip so I switched it to direct plug in to the outlet. Dead! Not at all happy with this Fitbit.  It does not count all my steps and keeps locking up.  I will walk 100 steps and it does not move.  Keeping my phone in my hand - I get a better step count on the phone than with this device.  I have to keep rebooting it and it still does not count the steps like it should.  I walk 15,000 to 20,000 steps per day and now I realize that it is probably a lot more than that. Have had the Fitbit Charge 3 for years,, but could no longer see/read the screen,, so purchased the Charge 4.Be careful when you order. I chose the aluminum because it's one of the few colored bands I don't already have. Did not realize the side & back of the Fitbit face would also be plum. Now need to figure out how to exchange! This product was worn under normal conditions by my husband.  It was delivered the last half of June 2020 and came apart today, about 13 months out.  We do not recommend Fitbit at all because my Alta HR lasted 13 months.  It simply stopped working.  We‚Äôll look forward other options. this fitbit 4 is a disappointment.. after only a few months of using the lighting has all but disappeared .. the screen is so dark i can barely see any information. android didn't link and of course its too late to return... I had to Google some of the functions to understand what I was doing but once I got the hang of it it was easy to use üòÖ Lots of options, great for tracking your stats. I think the Charge 3 was more user friendly. The settings in the Charge 4 are controlled on the device rather than the app so it takes a little getting used to. I've been using one for many years.  Hopefully Google doesn't wreck this now that they acquired it. The plastic nub that connects the device to the wrist band is broken. I should admit that they replaced it, but!! the replacement took more than a month for them.And the other problem is the replacement material is worse than the original one. My first device's plastic nub failed in 8 months after I purchased it. But the device that they gave me as a replacement failed in 4 months. YES I had this problem twice, even though I was very careful with the second device.And the warranty is over OF COURSE. This product couldn't even stay for a year.I have a Charge 2 as well. (I have been a very loyal customer for 4-5 years). My Charge 2 is still working. And it works very well. I'm switching back it.Charge 2 has a metal nub connecting the wrist band to the device.I don't know what was the designer of Charge 4 thinking when they decided to replace the metal nub with a cheap plastic one.TO SUM UP: I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE. IF YOU WANT A FITBIT, I'D RECOMMEND CHARGE 2. A small plastic piece that locks the band to the watch broke while taking the watch off under normal use. A replacement band probably will not work. I absolutely love this counter. The app is amazing as well! It is well worth the money, a great buy for a great price! It is always motivating me to do more and to do better. Could not recommend it more!!!!!! This waterproof fitness monitor works well and the app also is helpful. It helps motivate me to exercise more too. This is my 4th Fitbit---im not sure if the fit bit or the app sucks, but it tracks sleep poorly--I go to bed a 830 or 9 pm and it counts it as a nap from the previous day.  The app will not show sleep data until a long delay and reset, open app and close app.  The bands are standard and bulky, uncomfortable, I always change them out.  As far as keeping steps--that what its good for.  ITs not a fully functional device as it pretends to be--if you want that, then  get the Apple watch--but for $150 this is OK--I've had one for several years and I don't want all the stuff an apple watch does--so Il'l probably just stick w this--but FITBIT--stick w what you are good at--more is not always good--often its just more. I purchased the Charge 4 to track windsurfing and stand-up paddle sessions. The GPS turns off by itself during sessions at least 50% of the time. I do not recommend this product if you desire to have GPS tracking for your exercise program. Not very user friendly. Most things other than steps require a paid monthly service The wrist band irritated my wrist so badly I have to wear it up on my arm. The fabric is too stiff. The tracker itself works fine. Pros+Battery last 4 days, GPS set to Dynamic mode: day 4 without charging I woke up look my fitbit and it says battery low even with that message your Fitbit will provide your stats in the app, so I wake up at 10:06 am I look the fitbit app and it says the same thing I woke up at 10:06 am very accurate, battery was at %6 or %8 percent.+Weather+Fitbit Pay? anyways you can go and pay at none rural area stores-Cons-You can barely see the screen at sunlight... find a tree or cover you Fitbit with your hand or hat if you want to see your clock or data.Good piece of tech for persons that want to track sleep and also for people that they don't want to use their smartphone for a walk or run cause have GPS built-in.If you want pay with a wearable that works like %98 everywhere go for a Samsung wearable, Samsung Pay works like %97 everywhere, Fitbit pay works basically like Apple pay they work most of the time at stores near Stadiums or University's or CasinosThe only thing that prevent me to give this Fitbit 5 stars is the screen... hopefully the Fitbit Charge 5 should fix the sunlight problem Battery does not last long. The only thing is that I can‚Äôt get a text message, or a phone call come up on the screen when they come in. They did on my Inspire HR. It is probably just me not knowing how to fix it. Bands come off much too easily. Cannot shut off all the annoying messages that continually pop up on the screen. Too many options. The Fitbit Charge 4 is overdesigned and the bands can easily come off when you don't want them to. This applies to both the bands supplied by the factory, and aftermarket bands. The flaw is in the attachment mechanism, which should be redesigned. I have been using trackers for years.  Big fan.  I switched from Garmin to what I thought was the market leader in fit bit.  The heart rate monitor seemed accurate.  Face functionality was fairly user friendly.  It does not accuratetly calulate steps(most dont really anyway) which is unfortunate. The biggest reason for my disappointment is that the waterproof element is suspect. I rarely ever take my fit bit off.  One trip to the beach was all it took to stop working.  I would have not worn it at all if they said in literature to not take into water.  In any event I just bought an additional charger and now I have a charger and no fit bit. It should last longer than 18 months. Charge 4 malfunctioning...touch screen responds intermittently.  I kept it long enough to make sure it wasn't user error as I am new user.  Amazon honoring replacement. New one arrives today. I like it but it should work correctly. We'll see... The unit its self is great the bands and band conections break 1 year gear if your lucky I bought this watch on April 29, 2021 to replace a Charge 3 I wore for 3 years. It finally blacked out on me and wouldn‚Äôt turn on. The Charge 4 band fell off and would not stay attached. I‚Äôm not hard on watches, but after reading the Fitbit customer blog I found that this is a fairly common problem with the 4s. I contacted customer service and since the watch was defective within the 90 replacement period they sent me a replacement watch. The new watch arrived and I was so happy until I tried to turn it on. It had the infamous black face. No little blinking light, no vibration when connected to the charger‚Äînothing!  So I again called customer no-support. They led me thru all the usual attempted fixes and nothing worked. It was DOA. So they said OK send the defective watch in, they will exam it then send me another watch.  Stay tuned it gets worse.The replacement of the replacement came in and guess what?  It wouldn‚Äôt turn on. So I called customer no-service and we went through all the required attempted fixes and nothing worked. Another DOA!  So I sent the replacement #2 back with a Fitbit supplied prepaid printout. I was told they would check it out and within 5-7 days fix or replace it. Then send me replacement #3 which I would likely get in 5-7 days. So I‚Äôm looking at another 3 weeks.I‚Äôm really frustrated and angry with Fitbit at this point. They have a defective product that has many problems. Just read the customer blogs on Fitbit. I have owned Charge 2 and 3 for the past 4 years. So I know how to fix many common glitches with the watches. The charge 4 is just a badly manufactured product.I‚Äôm keeping my fingers crossed on replacement #3. I‚Äôll keep you posted. I bought the Fitbit Charge 4 about 8 months ago and it has worked great. I love the functionality, weight, and even bought the premium package. However, the cheap plastic clip that connects the removable band to the fitbit came completely off while out for a walk. It looks to be a common problem according to the fitbit forums and one made by switching from a metal part to plastic. Luckily, I'm within the limited warranty period, so fitbit is sending me a new one, but you may want to think about purchasing the extended warranty as this may happen at any time. It works great, and I use it for steps! Great product. Just needs to have a better charger. Requires finesse and a little luck to get it connected correctly."
28,"Fossil Men's Grant Quartz Stainless Steel and Leather Chronograph Watch, Color: Silver/Blue, Luggage (Model: FS5151)",Computers,"I really love it. Watch model and image model mismatch I liked the watch and I think it looks beautiful but in its description says that it has Calendar Date but that is NOT true! I did not like that. Watch was great and as expected.  Amazon delivery needs improvement.  Delivered in plastic thin bubble wrap bag.  Metal case was dented and watch loose in bag.  This is a gift so we‚Äôll see if any damage to watch. It's a gift for my husband and it came in a container that says *girl* all over it. It's a man's watch... The reason for this rating is because of the shipping. I was super unhappy/borderline pissed when I opened my box. The watch was outside of the tin, off the watch holster, and essentially the entire contents of my package was in separate pieces. I'm lucky my watch was even ticking and in one piece. I was very excited about this purchase but they really need to fix their shipping. Love the watch and wear it daily.  Only wish it had a light.  Great for casual and formal occasions. vary nice watch I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES IT!!! It is great quality!! The only reason I am giving it four starts is because it came in a tin, then the tin was just loose in a larger box. When I received the package the watch had fell out of the tin and was just getting tossed around the box. It had a scratch on it which I am assuming is from the tin continuously hitting it. Lovely looking watch I'm not sure about setting it up the instructions don't match the product code. As a time piece it is sometimes difficult to to see the hands. Not sure all the date hand works. Got this as a gift for our son, it is absolutely gorgeous, but kind of difficult to figure out how to set it up. The instructions list so many different watch types. I do have to take it in to have the band adjusted, but the website through Fossil said any store will do it. Actual watch is much darker then what is shown in the picture Bought this for my boyfriend, for our one year anniversary. He loves it, he also complained about 4 being incorrect but other than that it‚Äôs a good watch. Worth the price in my opinion. Really really nice for a fossil watch. Classic and clean look. Very good looking. Only con is the leather band which i can tell is gonna need to be replaced within a year of excessive wear. Its in good condition but you can tell the leather is fragile. Should not deter you from buying. New bands are $20 and this one will still last a while (6months +) and i wear my watch almost other day. The piece is 10/10. Attractive watch, but too big for my husband's wrist. Why do watches have to be so big these days? Not everyone wants one this large. Had to return it, and he went back to his older but just the right size watch. After three months one of occasional usage the buttons just fell out of the watch. Not too attractive and must be available at much lower price Amazing product The day of the month ""dial"" doesn't work. It is constantly stuck at the 12pm (straight up) position. When you try to change the date, the little hand will not move. The watch itself works and looks fine, but I did see multiple people complain about the ""month dial"" not working. If I could go back, I'd just buy a different watch. My Husband Loved the watch it is perfect, except that it did not have a light on it that he could push on when it‚Äôs dark. My step dad loved this. üòÅ No instructions for additional buttons on watch watch is ok ok....but packaging was third class..seems like someone had opened the package..box was open n i m not sure whether it is original or first copy the only thing that bothers me, is why are the roman numbers on the watch wrong for 4 and 9 Product is not up to the mark compare to as shown in picture.I suggest do't buy itU get better option in the stores in the less price Looks wayyyy better in the picture than in person.Cheap made. Save your cash for something better It is a classy watch, but simple. It has a good look and It fits in tuxedo well Duplicate Not even one month and this happened The watch didnt come with the tags!!B This is deffinately made in china strap is really cheap material i bought this is a going out watch now ut sits in my drawer. Ill stick with my g-shock. Watch came in shipping box with no fossil box- Very upset. Sending back Wasn't that nice. The case arrived beaten, it did not have the guarantee certificate, the watch was without protection in the case, apparently it does not take care of the details when sending So far loving it. Its original and it did came with warranty card and also I verified with fossil website. I bought it for $43 , what a bargain!! Quality watch. Looks elegant. Very sturdy watch and strap. These watch faces are great and classy.  The loop on the band broke on this one for me after about a year, very disappointing. My college age grandson was very impressed with the looks and features of this watch.  The leather band is of good quality and comfortable to wear. Belt is not of good quality The watch which was delivered to me is totally different from the image shown above.And the strap was very chip in quality and the colour of the starp is not same which is shown above. Awful presentation... without the original box I personally think that this watch is very cool. The blue face draws great attention and it looks like a much more expensive watch than the price reflects. It's a very nice casual watch that will be noticed. Excellent design and quality Nice watch, as most fossil watches are. I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and it looks great. It is a little big for him: we will have to remove a few links (and he is not a small man!) There is nothing spectacular about it but the quality is with the price. Nice watch Beautiful watch. My boyfriend loved it. I saw that people wrote that the 4 is not the correct numeral. So I looked this up, and there's millions of theories online that try to explain why sometimes it's IIII. But honestly it didn't bother me or my BF. The only thing is that the band almost didn't fit him. I'm not sure if it says what wrist size it would fit, but he has it on one of the last notches. Otherwise it came quickly and looks so classic with an edgy twist! Great looking watch Very nice watch! Very good Fake watch. Not a oringinal. Beautiful watch. I purchased for my Father for Fathers Day and he loves it! Great watch for the price. Classic and very clean look Solid watch...hefty and well crafted. Nice mix of modern look with old school features like roman numerals. Only drawback is the face is black, but so is the second hand. So it's often difficult to see. Not a deal breaker by any means, but something to think about before you purchase. It is look like fake fossil, returned it. I didn't get warranty card with proper stamp and also any bill with this üòë My boyfriend loved this watch , it is very handsome on. Band needs to beak in , o my reason for 4 versus 5 stars. I wanted a reliable timepiece that was fashionable with a pop of color. I also was looking for a comfortable leather band. This watch adds a bit of style, class, and variety to my wardrobe. It keeps perfect time, looks great and the soft leather band is most definitely comfortable to wear. I haven't tried out any water resistance and probably never will since I have a dedicated sport watch for recreation. The watch has a classy look.  Love it! I dislike the way I found the box The product was good, the deal wasn't. Later discovered that the same watch was available at the store for a lower price. Felt scammed. Don't buy this online, get it from the store only. :/ I never send my this watch !! but i love it !! The box looks used and old. The belt is more dark blue then visible in the product images. Not satisfied with the quality,doubt on the product. Anyone else faced the same thing ? Watch quality was good but this watch is with comple dark brown belt showed on Amazon as well as fossil site. But I received watch having brown belt in front n offwhite below. Product was genuine as I confirmed with fossil shop. so there was mismatch in terms of color I received only papers without the watch itself Nice very product Good I bought this for my son and he loves it. However, I find the band a little too small. This watch is a great addition to my collection. Fossil is a well known brand and this watch lives up to that name. It is versatile to be worn with casual or formal wear. It is not too thin or too thick. It sits perfect on my wrist. The black band brings out the black in the watch much better than a metallic band would. Just more crap from China , What else need I say broken second hand and stern; quit working in only 4 months of light use.  Return to Jomashop for repair but they not fix it, saying it does not cover under waranty Need to return thisMissing watchReceived another watch Beautiful watch, absolutely gorgeous.The band is the shortest I've ever seen on a watch but I believe that's just how Fossil bands are.The reason for my low scoring is because the watch doesn't keep time. This is the main function of the device, in which it fails at. I set the time upon arrival and the very next day it was 5 minutes slow. Very disappointing. fake item was delivered to me It was a good value for the price. Completes any dress outfit well. The watch looks okay and it will be a Christmas gift but the box got here open and dented. I‚Äôm very disappointed because it supposed to be a better quality brand but the delivery was ver disappointed. I hope the watch it is not broken because it is not cheap and usually amazon is better with their delivery.üò° Received watch where the box was already opened and re-sealed.... cannot trust the genuinity of it.... initiated return....the metal box was also open .... Not good be careful with the purchase.... Leather is not good, after using 1 month leather got faded. i used to have the same kind of watch tats from fossil store and i can feel the difference between them. its not genuine fossil watch 3 months after use watch stopped running intermittently. Replaced battery but the issue persisted. At that point sent the watch to fossil for repair($11 in shipping, fossil does not cover). Ran for about a month and same issue is back again. Not in return window so money wasted. Trusted fossil as a good brand until now. I think this is an average product when compare it to the cost of product.Dial is not good that i was thinking. I like the watch well enough.  It has an elegant look about it and the Roman numerals give it something extra. What was really a disappointment from that 'new watch experience' was the lack of any kind of instructions. They included a multipage warranty booklet in several languages but couldn't include one page of instructions?  It was easy enough to find them on fossil.com but it was 20 pages with very short instructions for every watch they have.  Sometimes fitting 3 different watch instructions on one page. Very un-classy in my book and took away from the experience some.  Also, in reality now that I better understand what the chronograph does and that it is only good for 30 minutes it is a pretty useless feature. If I go back to - it is an elegant watch that tells time ... I'm more content. Missing manual and tin box Date chrome is not working.. returned twice I was very much disappointed after looking at the watch.amazon has sent me the used watch. It was already ticking and back steel cover has scratches on it. Belt's colour has also changed dark on the inner side as if it happens when used for long time. Amazon shame on you to send such products when we are actually putting so much money in it. I like the color of the band . Very nice looking . The watch itself is lovely. But I received it in a broken box, out of the tin it's supposed to come in. The watch was bouncing around the box and the battery is already going which is unusual. Because this is a Christmas gift so I wouldn't have tried the battery until then. It's using up juice right now for no reason. It looks like the watch was just thrown in the box. Luckily there are no scratches. Disappointed by the actual watch. Looks much better in photos So far a decent budget watch that looks solid and I don't care terribly if I beat it up. So far so good. Clean, simple and at a great price. Only complaint is the band a bit short for me, giving me only a few holes for adjustment, despite not having large wrists. Good buy based on looks and price. Seriously don't go for this.  It doesn't look as premium as it looks in picture. Device was already working when it was delivered to me which will not be in case of new product buy. Good value, just doesn‚Äôt have date that was my oversight Product is amazing. But shipped was horrible. The box had no filler, and the was loosing, and could of scratch on the metal boxx This watch was for my nephew. It looks good in photos but when I received it, it was not that attractive. It is a very attractive watch for sure, however it was delivered without the intermechanisms working. This led to me returning it and purchasing a different fashion of a different fossil watch. This may have been my poor luck, however based on the look of it, it was almost perfect I love the looks of this watch,  however the day hand doesn't work manually or automatically. Looks great, gets used every day. I like the look of the face and size.  I have found the strap to be stiff and one of the two strap loops to be very close to the buckle portion.  Not a big deal but take effort to put on and take off The watch is awesome. But very very disappointed with the container tin,i received a plain black and golden one. May sound trivial hue n cry but trust me,fossil tins are a piece of art worth a collection.Anyway thumbs up for the watch n down for the tin. I like the style most of all.  Wish it did not arrive with the battery running.  Not sure how long the battery has been running before I recieved it.  I do not believe it is a fake. Seller does not appear a seller from china. This watch is backed by Amazon.  So I fill I have some protection. This watch is great, and the strap is absolutely killer. The crystal can be a bit too reflective, and I really wish the watch would show the date instead of the 24 hour subdial. I also wish the chrono timed more than 30 minutes, as my lunches are 1 hour. However, this watch really wears well and comfortable. The cream color on the Roman numerals matches well with the strap. Manufacturing of this watch was in 2018. Why to buy that old product? Great detail Nice watch, leather band looks a little cheap though. Husband loves this watch , great quality! Nice material Sub-dials are non functional. I'm returning Watch's build and looks are good, however, the chronograph dails were not working properly!!! I really like the design of this watch. I really like the Roman numerals. I own several fossil watches. It was well worth the money I paid for it. If you‚Äôre looking for a great stylish watch I highly recommend the grant by fossil. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. I‚Äôve never had to adjust the time on it and I have had it for almost a year. The only time I set the time was for the time changes. I'm going to return it watch is not working. Fully disappointed with this product first time wrost pack watch not fully working i am also not received warranty card  üò≠üò≠üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§"
29,"Fossil Men's Nate Quartz Stainless Steel Chronograph Watch, Color: Black (Model: JR1401)",Computers,"Typical Fossil watch, cool to look at but hard to see in the dark. I love it! I give it 5 stars ! One of the nicest watch I have ever owned! And it doesn't show dirt and I wear it to work and out and it functions great for both occasions Beautiful watch my boyfriend loved it Is great my cousin loved it Nice watch! Completely as advertised Scratches all over this watch! Really sharp looking! Bad quality Looked at too different ones in stores and both were broken I really enjoyed the watch when it first arrived and then within a few weeks the band kept snapping off and eventually broke completely. Overall beautiful design but the quality wasn't there. I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas. He loves the flat black color and the heavy weight of the watch. Looks great! I am pissed! This watch was supposed to be new! Therenjoy are scratches on the top of the watch and the plastic of the watch face isn't properly fixed to the front of the watch!!! You can't tell in the picture but there are also bubbles in the plastic! First off, I've been wearing fossil watches for around 20 yrs. I have quite the collection. I will also admit that it's been a few years since I've bought one. Well my birthday rolled around and I decided to buy myself a new watch. Fast forward to delivery day. You couldn't even start to compare this watch to the ones I have sitting on my dresser. This watch is a cheaply china made piece of junk. I am severely disappointed in what fossil is turning out nowadays.  Sending it back The face misted up after sticking my hand in the swimming pool. Not as water proof as advertised and you can't see the face in dim light.  kind of a waste.  expensive too.  I'll go with a glowing version next time. The watch is beautiful. The packaging it came in seemed cheap for this expensive of a watch. The watch is not 10 ATM water resistance as published, it is only 5 ATM I do like this watch.  It is a large watch with easy to read markings.  I like heavy watches as well and this one is hefty.  One con that I read about this watch is lack of light or luminous hands.  No big deal as may fine watches do not have lights on them. I wish the hands glowed at night. Other than that a great watch for the price Fossil Nate Chronograph Analog Black Dial Men's Watch - JR1401

I got a defective items two times(after replacement).Also the packing was not so good.Both time the i opened the package watch was out of the box. Cambium Retail is selling fake fossil watch. Within 2 weeks the battery died. The battery is supposed to work for 2 yrs. The black coating too is coming off.  Timer function is not working too. Byt the watch looks good. I like the watch. Seems rigid and durable, i've had other fossil watches before and they last. I didn't test the water resistance but it keeps time. My only grumblings is that it's a bit big, which is ok, but the shipping packaging was an envelope which had the box arriving banged up and deformed (which is a pity i was actually going to use it), luckily no damage to the watch, but also no instructions for setting time or using timer and the random third dial which turns out to be a 24h clock. Good watch, just a bit carefree in terms of last minute shipping details. excelente! This is a VERY nice looking watch. It was just to big for my wrist. Whish it was smaller. Sharp looking watch. I liked that it had a larger face but the 3 pieces on the side ended up cutting into my wrist within about 20 minutes. I read that other people said the same but I was hoping it would not bother me, but it did :( I received a scratched up watch so I returned it. It looks exactly as pictured however I was hoping for a dark black but it‚Äôs more so a matte black. If I do purchase again I would buy from the fossil site simply because they do free engraving. great watch nice watch Don't buy the watch from this seller...I thought having paid almost 130 dollars for a watch, it would atleast be of good quality..However I found that the watch had scratches and was already worn before...Moreover the quality was not that great..I will not recommend anyone to buy this watch... Very durable product I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for my son. Needless to say, when he opened the gift, he was very disappointed to see that the watch had numerous scratches and scuff marks in the paint on the watch bracelet. I am returning the watch for a refund because the scratches were unacceptable. I am not sure if Fossil's process of coloring the watch was done with quality in mind. Dead battery even after replacement. üñ§ Keeps perfect time & looks good on my wrist If you like the big style watches you‚Äôll like this one Great watch, nice and big and chunky the way I like it cause I‚Äôm a big guy and most watches look puny on me.With the 2 inch face this is not the case! Functions and settings are all straightforward and great my only reason for not giving 5 star rating is the strap is on the small side.( my wrists are 8inch circumference where you should wear the watch but I have to have it on the bone) I only just get it on the last hole which is v minor but means I have to source a longer strap with same kind of thickness as this so it doesn‚Äôt look weird.Other than the strap v happy with the watch Very nice watch, easy to read with a large face. Band is a little stiff but hopefully will soften up with usage. I got a defective product. The watch is not working!!Highly disappointed...was looking forward to it! Beautiful. Exactly what I wanted. Very good quality Nice looking watch. Tired of digital watches, I wanted an old school analog watch. This however doesn't have a backlight and the hands are not lumenescent. At this price, that is unforgivable. The date display is also tiny. Overpriced for what you get. Real color is much lighter than photos here! that is disappointing and not not good. Husband loves it. Beautiful, stylish but without light.  Large and heavy but is my preference. Waste of money Nice watch but I am disappointed. I ordered this watch for my fiance for Christmas. When it arrived the watch was out of the container and the band was scratched up. Luckily the face wasn't damaged. Ordered a replacement and it arrived scratched up too.  Planning to return the replacement too. This was a gift for my husband.  I love the large face watch for men. Something wrong with it Thanks Purchase this as a birthday gift for my partner. Beautiful watch, have to get a link removed so it'll fit properly other than that it's perfect. They can only be in water for swimming for around 1 hour in fresh water before the timer button stops to work. Not a bad review good product. Water resistant could be better. My watch chain has been broken twice as the steel spring bars were not that good and fogg is getting formed in watch dail and unable have clear visibility of time. im very disappointed against this. Too Big and the weight is too much on my arm! I gave it away! I bought this as a Valentine's gift for my boyfriend, I figured I buy something a little bit expensive and I came across this, he saw something just like this in stores even the brand Fossil itself. It looks exactly like this but I have a feeling it's a knockoff.. pretty upsetting since I did save money for this. The box isn't what I saw in stores and opening the box I got afraid because the watch wasn't supported, it was just laying in a empty box and I image it could have broke with all the movement. It's gorgeous and hope my boyfriend likes it. I was very disappointed with how this was delivered. Came with a cute box for the watch to sit in but doesn‚Äôt come with a cover. How am I suppose to wrap it for Christmas? Because it didn‚Äôt have a lid it was also tumbling around in the box. Watch keeps good time and looks like a mans watch it is totally blacked out in the dark. Not cool would not have bought if known that Yeah the watch works and is new like expected but not happy with much else. The box it was shipped in was big and had no void fill so the tin the watch came in was dented from flying around in the box. On top of that the tin is very girly with flowers all over it. Doesn‚Äôt go well with the man‚Äôs watch inside that I ordered. The watch was scratched put of box and process to get exchanged was a pain. I did receive credit but I was trying to keep the watch or have a new one sent. Customer service didn't listen we'll Neither a warranty card nor official packing of fossil. Ordered it 2nd time, 1st time I got used product nd 2nd time widout warranty card. Looks like it is wrapped by third quality company Good watch for the price. It came with scratch marks already on the black finish. Most likely switching brands for my next purchase. I was disappointed. The images made the watch look amazing. It was bulky and heavy. If it was slimmer and lighter it wouldn't be so bad.  The watch didn't even work. It was broken the first day I received it which made it worthless to me. It would cost too much to send back so I just put it In my junk drawer for a reminder of "" You get what you pay for "". It's really lightweight but other than that I love it Perfect Not the best Really happy with the watch. Looks sharp!!! Love the watch very manly and fast delivery... The only thing is that it doesn't have visual in the dark This is how I receive my watch, everything separated, not in the box... this is my second watch I purchased in this platform the first one I got it good but I can‚Äôt say the watch will work properly cause the box is broken, it should received a huge hit to make it felling apart from carton protection and the metal box... so disappointed I don‚Äôt know what to expect from this. I bought this watch and so far i am satisfied with my purchase. Its very sporty , large face and nice dials. The only disadvantage that this watch is a leather band and not Rubber band, also a watch of this magnitude should have Illuminous hands, its impossible to read in the dark and not sure if the leather band will hold up when contact is made with water. Purchase this watch if you want a sporty look but not if u looking for a much durable sports watch. Had a couple scratches on it, but is a nice watch. Easy to read. Large but comfortable. Came in it was out of its box when I opened the package the band was already broken Face of the watch was WAY too big. Returned it. Very cute This watch was fabricated and worn. Very noticeable scratches. Horrible. the color is extraordinary... I gave this watch to my son for a Christmas present. I personally would not have chosen this particular watch for a gift. It is large, dark and bulky. My son requested this watch, so i purchased this time piece to make him happy. He is young and a college student so his style is very different then mine. My son loves this watch and receives many compliments when he wears it. So I‚Äôm sure this watch is a nice enough quality watch but without a manual or instructions on how to use it it‚Äôs pretty useless‚Ä¶ The only thing it came with in the box was a card that said go to their website and download the instructions after doing that you find this model number isn‚Äôt in the instruction list and it says to call an 800 number, after waiting on hold for 20 minutes the first time and having the line hang up on me and then another 20 minutes to finally get somebody to pick up the line someone in very broken English explains to me that they will send me an email with the instructions for this model number, so after I received this email I opened it up and it‚Äôs the same instructions that they have on their website that again does not include instructions for this particular model number. Before I decided I would send this watch back right away, I did a Google search looking for an instruction manual for this particular model Number to try and find outside sources for instructions on how to use this watch and Google doesn‚Äôt even have any information for this watch. links were scratched from the packaging but besides that it was a good choice for a new watch. . . Box arrived open with watch out of the pouch. The transport broke the box but the watch was ok. Watch exactly as pictured The watch itself? Great. The size is really cool. The packaging? Completely damages the watch. The watch comes ‚Äúin‚Äù a tin gift-box that has no sealing enclosure, and both times I ordered the item, the watch came damaged and scuffed and scratched due to falling out of the obviously easy-to-fall-out-of tin. Spend the extra $30 or so and just order through the manufacturer‚Äôs website. Gifted this for my fianc√© for Father‚Äôs Day & he loves it! Very heavy. Band not adjustable. No instructions. Can't find model on line. Although certainly not a luxury watch, the Fossil line is a solid timepiece and this model is no exception.  I have a pretty extensive watch collection and this is my third Fossil in my lineup and I've always been pleased with their functionality and style.  It's a large face but one that doesn't overwhelm.  A good value for the money. Fake product Cute but a little expensive. Great quality, finish and style overall. Can't believe it's at a very reasonable price. This watch was very heavy and I didn't like the large white numbers on the face when I actually saw the watch in person. MENS watch arrived packages in a box designed for GIRLS complete with an actual picture of a woman and flowers AND the words ‚ÄúYES GIRL YES‚Äù??!!! SOOO TACKY AND CHEAP of the seller to have the audacity to send out a product like that. Definitely NOT suitable for gifting now. Will not be purchasing ever again. My husband loved this watch! I was sent a used watch in a dented box. There were no fossil booklets. I did get a full refund but was very disappointed because it was going to be a Christmas gift for my man. He loves and collects fossil watches. Wish it was easier to remove a couple links. Bought it for my boyfriend and it was too big Excelente producto Easy to see time and very durable.  Great leather band also. Bought as a gift. Very sturdy and nice looking watch. My boyfriend loves it! Overall, I am satisfied with my watch. Cost me $15 to take the links off so it fits properly but I anticipated that. Great watch I love it. Do not recommend. Face and steel band is scratched. Poor quality packaging as well. very nice swatch excellent buy, highly recommended. a lot of QUALITY :D The feel and look speaks of excellence. My husband loves this watch. Product was bought a while back but never used until today.My husband put his hand in a pool to test the temperature and the watch stopped working. The watch went completely foggy and won‚Äôt work. It says 165 feet water resistant and this wasn‚Äôt even a foot deep! Pretty disappointed as it was the first time the watch had been used. too large and bulky for my taste Yes Rather large for my wrist. It is a nice watch that matches all of my outfits. However it is difficult to tell time in the evening. Nothing illuminates. Very likable The watch has a very nice dial and looks really nice. Unfortunately, the piece I received was old and I could see its color gone with time at some places on its band. Otherwise, the watch has a nice appearance. Didn't like. Face was huge. Returned it Strap broke after about a month.. easy to replace, and the watch is beautiful and the timepiece seems to be built with quality material. Strap was low quality it's ok, but the box where came the product was scratched and some dirty, The watch was in excellent condition but the package was spoiled i have had this watch for a while now and it still looks very nice."
30,Fruit of the Loom Men's Coolzone Boxer Briefs,Computers,"Boxers were ok. The color did start to fade pretty quickly and become loose after a few wears. But you can't beat the price. To be fair I haven't worn them that much yet so it's hard for me to judge but I was hoping they would be a little bit thinner material based on the description as being cool zone boxers. Just what I expected, comfort briefs The bag said 6 but only 5 came inside the bag. After washing them the seemed tighter on the leg openings than before being washed. I was expecting more of a moisture wicking benefit but they are about as moisture wicking as a wet shower towel. I will just go back to my standard breathable boxer briefs and not pay the extra money. I got 3xl for comfort but these fun really small These are oddly long. I order this brand of underwear for my son all the time. These do not fit properly at all. They almost come down to his knees! They fit fine when you first put them on, after a couple hours they are already stretching out and loose. You get what you pay for Very soft I found the underwear to be comfortable, fit well, and have no irritating tags.  I love them and will be re-ordering this brand in the future. Nice but shrink after wash not Fruit of the Loom quality, seams unravel Definitely moisture-wicking, a Good fit, and very comfortable. The Legs don't ride up, they stay put on my thighs. ordered for my grandson for boot camp, they were fine Hold up don‚Äôt really move up or down. Slot is great in front..?well you know why men Extremely happy with the fit and comfort. Retains it‚Äôs shape wash after wash. Would buy again Amazon suggested I buy the next larger size. I bought two sizes and I disagree with buying the next larger size. Product is nice Would order these again. Fit well As expected. Comfortable and breathable. Great length. Unfortunately there was one pair missing.  My son had already worn one so it was to late to return. Knocked of a star for that. They‚Äôre too loose and starch after a hour or less of wearing them I love them, but one of them ripped down the entire leg. Other than that they're very comfortable. Run small There was no packaging fort the underwear, they wewrer in a plastic film inside of a box! Breathable, comfortable, doesn't ride up. The gray ones fit better than the black ones and they came in the same pack. They all run small though. Waist is to loose Good quality Not really breathable. It‚Äôs okay for when your sweating. They feel good, could be a little heavier weight material, but feel good & take care of business, don't trap heat. Nice and comfortable when no activity involved, but they did not offer a long leg version.  They rode up my leg when walking for exercise on a hot sweaty day. I had to keep pulling them down from in between my legs. I‚Äôm portly and walk for exercise during my lunch hour but not with these on. Finally, a good pair of boxers! ""Web"" material on outer flap rubs important body part raw. DO NOT BUY! Fits him well! Breathable and comfortable. They came in a clear plastic bag, inauthentic? Also, feels like the cheapest of materials. Instant return, don‚Äôt bother buying. The vent held up to light is no more porous than other areas of the briefs They are new right then why is a pair ripped already took out of package and ripped at leg opening Happy balls, happy life. Amiright?!? I‚Äôm a weight lifter and crossfitter, the way these fit over my thighs makes them continually ride up until it feels like I‚Äôm wearing briefs I was looking for some White boxer briefs for a decent price. These where the ones I found. They fit perfect and are true to size. The price is fairly decent for this type of quality boxer briefs. I‚Äôm very satisfied with my purchase!! They are very comfortable and fit my husband amazingly. These Fruit of the Loom boxer briefs are extremely comfortable, soft, and surprisingly affordable! 7 pairs of undies for $20 is a great deal! Ok i bought XXL(3X wasn't available)the waist felt adequate but the butt seemed too tightI assume a larger size might allow better fit in butt but I would question if male bits might not peek under if leg were bought as larger size The waist is bigger than expected and they tend to stretch and ride up after a couple hours working in the sun they are a little off and like to get tight in the groin area Purchase for my son They arrived without any elasticity in the waist. The cut of this underwear is good, so I was hopeful when I started wearing them. However, the material is not that soft, and they lose all structure within a few hours of wearing them. The material stretches and relies on the tight stitching on the legs to keep them in place. If you are active at all, you'll find yourself constantly readjusting to maintain comfort. I am not a person to be placing reviews but i not recommend them, when putting them on they are glued to my legs, but after a few minutes they stretch and are no longer comfortable it is unpleasant to be with them on Underwear fit pretty good but were kinda big around the butt, but the leg hems were a snugger fit. I would definitely buy more at this price and number of pieces. There very nice like I said fite just right Comfortable and breathable Only the crouch area is dry fit. The underwear was good but all pairs had holes in the waistband seams They are too big Assorted colors‚Ä¶ I got five gray one red and one blue‚Ä¶ I guess that‚Äôs assorted? These boxers run a little small around the waist and the leg compared to the ones I‚Äôve been buying at the store in the past. If I will ever buy these boxers again I will buy a size up. As far as been breathable I‚Äôm not sure there is much difference with the non-breathable ones. Also, maybe it‚Äôs my impression but the fabric seems to be a little thinner than usual.  I ordered the assorted colors package and didn‚Äôt get the colors I chose at the time of the purchase. So I guess ‚Äúassorted colors‚Äù means you get what they send you... Fits fair.gust a little short in the waist, although they are not uncomfortable. I love the extra long length of these boxers, no weggies EVER. Also they out dark fabric under your naughty bits to prevent staining which I like. However ive only had for a few wheels and my gf noticed a hole on the back of a pair already. After 2 washings the taint seams pulled apart on 2 pairs.  The others show poor sewing and stitching that will eventually fail. Price I bought this product over the others options because I was interested in the ‚Äúmesh‚Äù idea. If you want to buy a product that are the opposite as advertised then these are for you! The mesh section is the least breathable fabric on the boxers. They fit my body type just fine and feel good. I have no other complaints on their quality, but maybe just maybe a large company like this should do better at quality control at their R&D phase. Size was accurate. Very comfortable. Plenty of room but I still feel supported. They fit well, and are very comfortable.Very affordable! They don't seem to be cut right. They slide off and poor elastic in the waist. for me to small Cool & comfy Bought these hoping to get a good life out of them. They lasted three months before the waistband began to separate from the main body. So these fit weird. Really weird. Let me preface by saying I am 5'9, 140lbs, pretty average build. I have larger than average manhood so I don't like when boxers ride up too high. These, however, have the opposite problem. The crotch is so low, it looks like those sagging diaper pants that rappers were wearing a few years ago. It's honestly comical. No support unless you hike them up past your belly button like a grandpa. The excess material bunches up and you basically have the makings of that Louis CK bit. These are terrible quality, falling apart from day one. I did keep them and I am still using them but they've been falling apart from day one. These are either fake or the company does not care about their customers at all.I can't recommend these to anyone that wants to buy boxers that are not throw aways. if you are buying these and expecting them to keep that snug, looks good on you fit, they won't.  Obviously these are not the 10 dollar a pair shorts that fit snug and makes you feel good. They will do that the first time or two you put them on but after a couple of washings the honeymoon is over. But overall, for the price, they are ok with me as they make this u3 yr old feel like a champion body builder when you put them on the first time, yeah, look at me. LOL  They are a good buy, where else can you get that many pairs of feel good underwear for this price. I bought 21 pair. Item & its quality seems to be alright but reason of return is incorrect size. I don't like that get get loose after a bit, thought they would be snug. After I just wear for a few minutes. These are perfect, ever since BVD stopped making the best on the market. The briefs are nice. Unfortunately they ran small. The material used in these Fruit of the Loom Men's Coolzone Boxer Briefs is not moisture wicking or comfortable.  The material around the upper thighs rubs after a long run/walk irritates the inside of the crouch. Comfort and fit just right. I have been wearing fruit of the loom for what seems like forever. They have always been fine. Being a big guy, I buy accordingly. The waist band is fine but the elastic around the legs is way too small and is tight around my thigh. When I sit down, it's even worse. Don't get these. Less than 4 wears and they are already coming apart at the seams. Definitely a waste of my money. I would buy these if the whole pack was just ten bucks, but the price they're charging is a complete rip off. Elastic is Flimsy. Ripped off after only a few wears. Runs very small. Nut huggers for sure. These seem to be made well but are too small for my husband. He‚Äôs actually a large in clothing but prefers an xl in briefs. I think these will fit our 12 year old grandson. My waist is 34"".  That's how I buy my pants and that's been the size of my briefs for about 35 years.  In the past, I had the option of seeing sizes 32, 34, 36, 38, etc., so I was a little concerned to see the sizes available were ""32-34"", ""36-38"".  Any briefs that can fit a 38"" guy are definitely going to be swimming on me.  So I bought the M (32-34).  When I opened the package, the briefs looked like they were made for children.  I managed to get a pair on, but they were ludicrously tight.  I took them off and measured the waistband - 24"".  I mean, I know they're meant to be stretched, but TEN INCHES?I'll try the 36-38 just out of curiosity.  Maybe they're all just WAY too small and they'll fit.But the old undies that these are replacing feel thicker.  That's not a good sign. I have been buying fruit of the loom underwear since I can remember, these Mediums are way too tight. And I have not gotten that much fatter Works for me. Product was too small.. These arrived yesterday.  This morning I wore a pair of these for the first time, and noticed there was a hole near the seam, as if the fabric had been cut a bit short and was not large enough for the stitching to bring it all together.  When these arrived, they were not in a ""Fruit of the Loom"" package, so I'm wondering if they  had been returned previously.  Needless to say, I am not pleased, and I certainly am opposed to wearing briefs that had been returned, if indeed this is the case.  Quality control needs to do a better job. The 9 sets of briefs I ordered came in the right size, but instead of the multicolored option that was listed, I received 3 dark blue pairs and the rest are a navy camouflage... Don't let the price tag fool you into buying these. Overall, they run a little on the snug side - and the waistband for some reason has an even tighter feel to it. You'll find yourself adjusting yourself through out the day. It's really troublesome. You'll end up using them as house rags and picking up a different version of these boxer briefs. The shorts are great but me having a 35"" waist I had to choose a short that was a little big or a little tight. The quality is good. However, the fitting is not great. At least it did not work for me. You should order 1 size larger,they fit a little snug,otherwise ok. Really like them, sticker came off easily though its comfortable but poorly made. came apart after wearing once and washed it. not the product it use to be. wont buy again. They are not that supportive at all, better off to keep buying from Casual Male. At least I know their stuff fit great. But with that said I might try a different set from someone else on here. Any suggestions would be great Thanks Great fit excellent comfort. I like the way they did not stretch around the waistband or legs Always having to pull up, don't hold the waste. Not comfortable, average size guy and there isn't enough room in them, between in-seem and waste band. Just not a good design. Good product you get your money‚Äôs worth Personal purchase These looked fine but we just received them this month and they have only been worn once or twice and the seams are coming apart.  Poorly made - at least these are.  Otherwise they would have been okay. The elastic on these are a bit tight.  After a few wears the elastic is coming off of the underwear.  I've already had to throw 3 of them out. Don't fit right THEY SEEM TO FIT  FINE UNTIL YOU WEAR SHORTS ANS SEEMS THAT DISTANCE FROM CROTCH TO TOP OF WASTE BAND IS ABOUT 1 INCH SHORT. A 36 INCH WASTE AND BY BUTT SEEMS AS IF THEY ARE FALLING OFF SO MUST TUCK A T-SHIRT IN MY SHORTS OR MY BUTT SEEMS TO BE FALLING OUT.MY ""JOCKEY"" UNDERWEAR MEASURES ABOUT 1-1/2"" LONGER FROM CROTCH TO TOP OF WASTE BANDTHESE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE BUT THEY FEEL LIKE FALLING OFF The fit is a lot smaller than expected and the fabric feels stuff and uncomfortable at times. But I can wear them and the do the job. Cheap and deceitful product This new kind of boxer feels like a whole different world. Had I purchased a bigger side, though, they would've been suitable. Haven't noticed anything different compared to any other boxers I've wore over the years. Exactly what i expected Returned product due to length of leg being too long. Great fit and feel only issue being a pair of them came damaged. Large hole on seam Buenos Chaffing , doesn't fit, literally had to rip it for it to not chaf Great comfort and value These boxers did the exact opposite of what they claimed. They do not keep cool down there at all night n fact they made it more sweaty. DO NOT BIY THESE! Anyone who said they work are bot! These are garbage. It's cool, feels great until time to urinate. No slot to use. I've been had! Despite what the sizing chart indicated, I found this item to be sized smaller than comparable brands. These WERE great, until they shrank almost a whole size when they were machine dried. They are now fit for donation only. Good thing that I won‚Äôt allow my family to wear anything that‚Äôs not washed first. Well my honey loved them they were comfortable, and breathable, and they didnt tear all crazy and they fit perfectly, i washed them and they didn't shrink!! Okay where do I begin...My rating says it all They don't breath at ALL, in other words Hot AF !Didn't fit one bit, they cut into your thighs and so much they rub inside seam around you crotch area, Hey just saying it like it is guys!I'm afraid to say if you go up a size even 2 if that would even help because it cuts into your legs bad !Moisture wicking you can forget that as well, I sit in A/C and you will be burning up down below if not sweating !Hope this Helps ""WILL NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE, I WISHED I HADN'T BOUGHT THEM""!!!!! works as it should good price Worst boxers I have ever bought,  they fit good at first but as day goes by they start to get loose and loose Couldn't find this out in my city, but Amazon had it.  Good price, fit and quality. The fabric does not breathe or Wick as it is advertised. they are the best in men's underwear I suggest that all men purchase the fruit of the loom men's boxer briefs Fit great and feel great.. would definitely recommend to anyone Comfortable I may have gotten a bad bag of these. Two pairs have ripped after a few weeks. Last bunch I bought were more durable. I had to return them. They came in a plastic bag, not original packaging, and were way too big and too long. They fit liked they were for ""big and Tall size, not regular size mediums Their not good cheap I have already ordered a second time These are some good chonies. Good purchase. The quality is pretty good, it very comfortable and lightweight. It worth a buy in my opinion This item did not fit well I bought extra large XXXX and found it to not be made well at all. The fit was bad it was flat no no butt not a good product. Its ok! had fruit of loom breathables fit perfect, light comfortable, figured cool zone be as good if not better, they are just a little longer, live Florida we wear shorts all the time, these are just too long and not even close to being as comfortable, almost sent them back but figured just underwear so I kept them, but would not buy again A little tight but I think after few laundries and some time they will stretch out. Nice comfy not too loose, don‚Äôt even notice them.  They seem thin though. Hope they last. This product is very comfortable, but the waistband is very loose. The waistband, although comfortable, does not hold up the under shorts. I stay very tight Like the leg fit! The long size isn‚Äôt available any longer in size XL.  These are the regular length and they are ok, but I prefer the longs. Colors ran a little bit during washing, more than expected, but still a great product. Fall to pieces after 1 wash Poor material, horrible comfort, I  am only buying Haynes from now on Didn't give me the colors option that I ordered. Bag was ripped open. Not happy. They are very comfortable. Had to throw away a pair already because of holes Good fit and  comfortable to wear."
31,Furinno (99557LC/BK) Turn-N-Tube 4-Tier Multipurpose Shelf Display Rack - Light Cherry/Black,Home and Kitchen,"The shelf is cheap and very cheap looking  plastic tubes  Looks home made Product came and was damaged. I put the damaged piece on the bottom but still. Chips in the plywood shelving. It ok for what I am using it for ie storage in my studio.  It was easy to assemble. Product description on-line states 25lbs per shelf but instructions in box state 15lbs per shelf. The finish is terrible scratches and imperfections everywhere. Flimsy. AWFUL!!! I was desperate for shelves of this dimension, such a disappointment! I bought it for storage in the laundry room. Though it has space, it‚Äôs very wobbly, so don‚Äôt have kids around it if they are climbers. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much I tighten it, it‚Äôs still very flimsy and wobbly. it‚Äôs holding for now because there isn‚Äôt heavy stuff on it and my kids don‚Äôt play near it, but I would have gone with something a lot more sturdier. worst things that i've ever had Easy to put together I use this shelving to hold water, soda, etc. Now I'm not tripping over drinks on the floor that didn't fit in the frig. So happy with this purchase! Some of the pegs don't screw all the way in. Therefore it left the product very unsturdy.  I have purchased these shelves before and was very satisfied with them. So, I don't know what happened this time! It was good for the short notice of needing a shelf but its not sturdy and doesnt hold much. super disappointed. The shelf works great for us, and what we wanted for, however it isn't very sturdy.  Don't lean on or put things on it too quickly.  Be careful and remember you get what you pay for. Is it easy to put together? Yes. Does it look okay when put together? Sure. Is it sturdy? Hell no. If you've got carpet, or anything such as a collectable you want to put on this, don't bother! I poke it with one finger and it wiggles, instantly knocking over anything of value, especially if it's on a delicate stand.My advice? This is only good for a super cheap and super quick solution, but certainly not one for the long haul OR anything breakable/valuable. My advice is to spend a little more cash and get you something *STURDY*. This thing is damn near a joke. Looks nice, but very unsteady. Love the product although it had a small defect on it. Overall its a very nice storage piece for a small area. Very easy to assemble. Very very shaky. You really shouldn't pit anything on it at all. I love these! Assembles in a snap with a clean professional finish For thr price not bad Feels like it'll crumble or fall over at any second I only received the shelves and poles, but not the pieces to hold it together. So I‚Äôm pretty disappointed. I‚Äôm organizing one of our spaces and was waiting on this piece. I‚Äôve contacted the manufacturer to get the pieces-but we will see when they respond and how fast/if they send them out. If not I will be sending back. It‚Äôs a great price and it seems simple enough to place a few lightweight things on it-but if I would have known it was missing pieces, I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered. It fit perfectly in the small area we needed it for. My grandson put it together quickly. We look ve that no tools were needed. Looks nice!! I'm not sure what else I expected from a >$30 shelf.  Though I was expecting the vertical posts to be metal, but they are just hollow plastic.  When assembled it feels very uneven and not sturdy.  I guess its good for a back bedroom if you secure it to the wall.  Just not something you'd use as a display where people can see. Ordered this for my open pantry.  I can use it for my box items. I store my can goods on the bottom to keep it from tipping over.  It does come with a zip tie for the wall but I have beautiful shiplap and don't care to drill a hole for the screw.  I do recommend this shelf for lighter items.  It's very pretty. Cute shelves! As pictured and relatively undamaged. Not the sturdiest thing in the world, so I'd be careful placing anything fragile on them or loading it top-heavy, especially if you're placing it on (thick) carpet. I was planning to use it for stuffed animals, so no big deal there. Mine got knocked over right after assembly. Easy to knock over, but sturdy enough that it won the fight against my wall and left a dent in the wall, which is a point in its favor I guess??? Easy to assemble and made in such a way that you can choose the amount of shelves, even breaking it down into two shelving units, or buying a second set to assemble it taller, etc. The product quality is pretty cheap, but so is the price. I didn't expect a lot from it, and I got what what I expected. I kick myself for not paying attention to dimensions.  I thought this was like a previous tube shelf I bought for my sons room.  It was not.  Much shorter and not nearly as wide.  The shelves were chipped on the edges upon opening.  The tubes had several that I had to force together because the top opening was slightly smaller than the screw in end.  Once together and my figurines were on it, even touching the unit everything falls over.  I'll use it for now, but even for an inexpensive shelving unit I shouldn't have wasted my time.  If the sturdiness was better it wouldn't be so bad, but I have a 4 year old and a rambunctious puppy. Not what I thought would like a refund Cheaply made. Easy to assemble but not very sturdy. Has to lean against a wall. I would NOT place in a kids room or have around a kid learning to walk. It holds items and was exactly what I paid for in the price Super easy to assemble. Took me less than 10 minutes. Decent quality for what it is. Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I ordered 2 of these, one arrived fine. The other appears to have a lot of water damage and paint chipping off. A little disappointing. Very easy to put together except it‚Äôs wobbly and smaller than I thought. It doesn‚Äôt hold many items. I wanted it for blanket storage in my laundry room and can hardly get them all on it. Item arrived on time and packaged properly. The shelf was easy to assemble and sturdy enough for what we planned on using it for in the room.  I would purchase this item again if the need arose and the one we currently have still doing great. Very flimsy. I put some books and bottles of vitamin and mine collapsed. Can not hold much weight. I like the shelf but it came damaged on the left hand corner on bottom of it which is my only gripe but everything else was fine, it was easy to assemble and it only took like 8 minutes to put up and I didn't have to use any screws or drills, I would recommend this item to anybody who is looking for a shelf that's easy to put up and doesn't take hours to figure out how to put it up. cheap plastic tubing item came with cracks in the paint/wood, patches of what looks like stains, and scratches on the wood itself as well.guess i got what i paid for... It was easy to assemble but is not as sturdy as I was expecting and wobbles.  It has a nice look. buy it  broke after hold heavy thing Came with scratches and a chipped corner on the shelves. Glad it was less than $25 when I purchased it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth more than that. I also wouldn‚Äôt recommend putting anything heavy on the shelves. Storage capacity not good This thing is all sorts of wrong. First paint all chipped. Looks like they placed tape over sides then painted over again. Legs are made of plastic. Ok I have had this product for about 1month now. I have moved it several times and it had not fallen apart or become loose. It is very easy to dust/wipe. It says 15-20min to put together but it only took 3mins to do. I have 2 of them and my kids 5,7,9 put it together with no problem. (I timed them to see how quick they could do it).It can hold lots of items . We use them for legos (got tired ofPutting them together again after they broke)1 issue: not as appealing and definitely cheap material so 3stars for that. Well it‚Äôs working for what I need ... BUT it‚Äôs hard to screw the legs in and I couldn‚Äôt get them all the way in ... but it‚Äôs working for what‚Äôs I need it for so !!! Perfect Perfect Perfect I have been buying a lot of cheap shelving for my basement and garage recently.. This one is probably the least sturdy and cheapest made,but not the cheapest price. Shelf was missing parts and the plastic was cheap and would not fit together. Not sturdy at all! Not worth the money! Horrible shelf. Made out of really cheap materials. The plastic tubes that are supposed to hold the shelf up broke easily and the fitment of the shelf was all loose and wobbly. Price is a bit high for the cheap materials used. Assembly is pretty easy. Overall don‚Äôt recommend anyone to buy this. Perfectly functional 4 shelf unit. I had these about a year before they crapped out and that‚Äôs more my fault than a flaw of the product. Cheap materials but totally useful and useful. Just don‚Äôt put heavy items on the shelves or try to move it around. I was storing juice and soda cans. Something fell into the unit and it broke and cracked. The shelves bowed a bit under the weight. This would be perfect to holdLighter items in a small area. You get what you pay for... good in a pinch I normally read reviews thoroughly before purchasing so I guess I didn‚Äôt pay close enough attention to the size of this shelf set.  It was a little small for me, I was surprised but I decided to keep the item anyway and will consider potentially buying another one in the future.I will say it was really easy to assemble, though, and all the parts were included and packaged nicely so they were easy to find.  And while people handier than I am would have figured out assembly on their own, I found the instructions helpful and well written.It‚Äôs also sturdy and looks pretty nice. Got this affordable shelf to place my plants on in front of our sliding door. Looks great, quality, color the best. It looks bigger on site. It will do the job for now. We needed a utility shelf and this is a little smaller than expected. More of a livingroom or office shelf I thought this was a utility shelf. It is basically a small knickknack shelf. I'm really not sure what you would use it for. I guess I didn't look closely enough at the size and pictures. I use as a plant stand its perfect If you want to store clothes(or anything heavy) on this it wont work. Not sturdy at all. Shakes and wobbles. Decided to use it as my one year old clothes instead. This rack is perfect for what we needed it for.  I am using this in a small case to put my son's car cleaning materials in one place.  It holds all of his stuff neatly and what an improvement over it being all over the garage.It holds all of his polishes, cleaners, rags, buckets and everything else.  It took 10 minutes to put together.I wish it came with a better way to connect the unit to the wall so it doesn't tip.  I had another and used it instead.  I did not tie around one of the tube leg sections as shown in the instructions.  Instead I used a smaller screw and secured it in the back of the top shelf, then to the wall. This way it is centered. I purchased this for my office to clear space off my windowsills...This thing is worse than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Cheap plastic. Wobbles anytime I take a book off of it. ""Wood"" is already warping ***Revision****I have had this stand for about 2 weeks and have very light items on this on and it is done for. The other one that is in my living room that I have had for a couple of years that had a 19 inch tv, a playstation, etc. on it and now about 200 DVD's is still in perfect condition. This new one had miniature Halloween decorations on it and was very shaky to begin with. Must have been a dud.I have had this before and the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."" Well with this nifty little space saving shelf you actually get a little more. I have a 19 inch flat screen on top, a PlayStation, wii, saga, Bluetooth speaker, router, sub woofer speaker and a shelf full of games all on the entire unit. I do not anchor it to the wall. And I do not move it around. I dust and sweep under that's about it. It will last. I only threw out my old one because I wanted a larger unit. It‚Äôs ok It was very easy to assemble and it looks nice, but it's not that sturdy. Is not that I don't like the item, the problem is that when I took it out of the box, the shelves are all pealed and all damaged on the edges, like if the product has been used and mistreated. I bought this for my funko pops and it fits well. Very study and the craftwork is well. Perfect for my small plants. The columns are plastic. It looks very cheap. But it hasn't fallen apart yet. Just recently assemble this shelf up for my new house. I was a little disappoint. Because its not that stable.. Seems easy to shake when fan blows it... But i do love the color! it was easy to put it together thou Its just brown plastic for the legs and is cheaply made so they barely screw together if you don‚Äôt have all the excess plastic out of the holes. Buy a metal shelf instead this is not going to last a year. I ordered two of these for my teenage son as a Christmas gift for this year, as he wanted some shelving to display his legos and action figures. The boxes arrived today, beaten up and had the item itself printed on the box. Not happy about that! So much for a surprise! Durable but small. I received a product beyond damaged and used. It has major water staining and warping. This almost looks like someone had it in their shed for a year and decided to return it. Wobbles without securing to a wall. Wood shelving smells like a hamster cage. Does work but cheaply made. Only had 3 tiers not what is pictured Product came broken looks like it was tossed in and out of the truck This was a Christmas gift and it came with multiple shelves broken....will have to return. False advertising on weight capacity, assembly instructions clearly say 15lb limit per shelf This unit was meant to meet a temporary need.  It is easy to assemble and reasonably sturdy.  A fair value for a unit. Perfect for my bathroom! Accented the shelves with cloth baskets Had this item for a couple of months and it eventually collapsed and I had to throw it out. Held no more than 15 lbs of weight (no big appliances, just held laundry supplies). Cheap material and not reliable at all. Inexpensive and easy to put together.  It looks good.  I put an window A/C on it in front of the window screen.  Happy so far and grateful to this company. Low quality material that don‚Äôt hold on well I would give it a minus-star if I could. Junk! It's unbelievably huge, I only installed 3 boards ,but the board can't afford too much weight and it bend .But anyway save a lot of room. Had hard time installing bcz the parts are too rough. Received damaged product Got this for my screened in porch to put plants on, etc.  shelves are already bowing. Very humid where I live and shelves don‚Äôt seem to tolerate that. Easy assembly. It was very quick and easy to assemble, and it looks nice. Mine arrived with a dent on the side of one shelf, but I just put that one on the bottom and out of sight so it doesn't bother me. It does rock pretty easily from side to side. Rather than using the included screw to tie it to the wall (because I rent), I just used string and command hooks. The product is as described, for the most part, and it does what it's supposed to do. It's pretty solid for being inexpensive, and for what it's worth, it is practical budget shelving with enough of a touch, depending which style finish you choose I guess, that it doesn't look bare bones.What sucks is:The fact that it arrived with multiple places having very visible damage - nothing extreme - but very noticeable and also easily avoidable... and by that I mean, simple packaging would prevent most or all of the kinds of damages I noted when I received this product. Even though it's entirely cosmetic, it's kind of the whole point and it also boils down to shipping and handling which just makes it a really lame reason for any kind of dents and scuffs to be such an eyesore. I mean, I can promise you these shelves were not made to be sold on showroom floors in furniture stores, so packing them to ship should not be a total afterthought.If you have the time for surprises and unknowns and then possible returns or exchanges or living with whatever comes your way, OR if you're using this shelf somewhere that's not necessarily visible, and you get the shelf heavily discounted AND sold in ""used - like new"" condition - then I don't see why not. Especially since buying it brand new at any price just means that the product will not be inspected, so it could be more likely to have unnoticed damage... Then just hope it doesn't get dinged and dented shipping to you. This was super easy to assemble, but it is wobbly.  I don't plan on putting many things on it so I'm going to keep it, but if you are looking for something sturdy this is not it.  Maybe if I put some weight on the bottom it won't wiggle so much.  The look is definitely something you would want if you're a college student so it's not beautiful furniture, but then again it's not really meant to be.  You get what you pay for. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE. Got this item for like 23 dollars and so disappointed. One gentle poke with one finger sends it rocking. Contacted support 3 or 4 days ago and no response. Even if it sat steady very cheaply made materials and not worth $59 what ever. Got screwed in this purchase big time even at $23. 3 of the 4 shelves were damaged upon arrival.  Overall the shelving design is pretty good but poor packaging can leave you with a damaged product upon arrival. Smells weird for a while after you take it outta the box Very strong unit, attractive too! In the 15 years I have either purchased, sent to review or given as a gift I can with absolute certainty say this is the gold standard by which I will measure items that are (no other way to honestly say it) utter garbage.I discovered that not even a single piece can be considered ""not defective"". Every single leg is made of the cheapest molded plastic I have ever seen and of the 12 legs sent, do not under any circumstances expect it to look straight. It was as if the legs were intentionally designed to be unique in length and don't worry if you accidently crack any of the plastic. They will do that for you from the factory free of charge.It does in fact not contain any foul odors, but it is absolutely the most horrible item your eyes will hopefully never lay on. I believe a more accurate name should be ""Quintessentially Crap multi-tier self""  Somewhere Bob Vila sheds a tear and questions whether making This Old House was even worth it.The shelves are all bent, the plastic laminate around the surface comes partially peeled and the laminate on the ""finished"" side has bubbles you (another free of charge add-on). So you never have to worry about accidently damaging the shelves, the manufacturer. Measure the item yourself (hopefully you will never have to) and after measuring all for sides, highest point is 44 7/16"" and lowest is 41 3/8"" inches in height.I strongly recommend you don't purchase this item, to not accept it even as a gift, and politely decline the item if paid to take it.Why did I give it 2 stars? It does have one (and I can assure you nothing more) redeeming quality and that is disassembly. Disassembly simply requires a Louisville Slugger and the rest is self explanatory. I ordered 2 of these, one was perfect. The other box comes with missing parts. SMFH I am SO pissed off! Didn‚Äôt realizes it was literally plastic poles that screw into each other. They didn‚Äôt all screw in easily either. Also the top has black toppers that screw in the hole that are very hard to put in. I had to push with the heal of my hand to turn them in. Looks nice but wouldn‚Äôt buy again It's ironic that the package includes a piece of paper that says they recommend you build it on top of the cardboard packaging as to avoid scratching the pieces ....but the shelves were already scratched up and chipped upon arrival....I haven't decided if I will return/replace yet because it's such a hassle with heavy furniture pieces lugging them back and forth in an apartment complex.After I set it up, it's very wobbly so if you decided to keep it, I wouldn't put any valuables or fragile items on this shelf. cheap plastic, can't handle weight I‚Äôm disappointed in this product. The poles are hollow plastic and the dimensions are not as described.I feel that I didn‚Äôt get the value at all, for the amount spent. This is one sturdy unit. Yes if you over load shelf you might see a little sag , but I‚Äôve never had a problem. I have several of these and they are still standing. So simple and easy to assemble. This is junk. Plus, I was missing a long pole  so I couldn‚Äôt use the top shelf. The bars are plastic. Screwing each part into eachother is definitely harder to do than if it were metal parts. Not sturdy but does the job (i have it set up inside the corner of my closet with 3 supporting walls. I don't regret buying it- but now realizing that the parts are plastic I do think the current price is a bit much. I wouldn't recommend this product if you want a good quality shelf. But if you're crafty and need something cheap im sure with alterations you can make the structure less wobbly. Great for extra storage in a closet , laundry room , garagevery sturdy It‚Äôs okay for the price. They come with a little pouch that has a screw in hook and a shirt zip tie, to I guess secure it. But that defeats the purpose somewhat considering it‚Äôs a small light shelf you‚Äôd probably like to be able to move often. It‚Äôs low to the ground so you would need to move it in order to vacuum/clean under it. Otherwise it‚Äôs good. Could use as a tall nightstand. It‚Äôs not very big, so for example my cat jumping up in it, it will wobble. I think this kind of furniture is good for either some office use, shop use or college student or temporary apartment use. For longer term house use I would want something more sturdy and stable. But for an apartment it‚Äôs easy to move use assemble etc. I guess you can always put some heavy item or plant on a bottom of it or books and keep it more stable. Liked the structure but it is way smaller then I imagined. It is a little flimsy and doesn‚Äôt have the greatest storage capacity but it is worth its cost. I was looking for sturdy but lightweight shelves to use in my RV pantry. These fit the bill! With a very slight bit of alteration (peeling off the veneer from the edges), I was able to fit them two deep PERFECTLY in the space. It gave me an insane amount of storage space for all my shelf stable foods, the baskets to hold them in, and even a few larger pots and dishes like my instant pot. SO happy with them!! Easy to put together and lightweight Wobbly Sturdiness Not bad! Won‚Äôt support a ton of weight, and can have a slight wobble on carpet... but overall I‚Äôm super happy with the value & quality! Nice looking addition to any room It was good, the problem  was it was the wrong color..It was pink..Not the color I want.. Easy to put together pretty sturdy way smaller than you expect Was putting it together and I had a long pole snap on me while I was twisting it in. I don't like to leave bad reviews but I got the wrong thing. I bought a shelf and got an entertainment center. This shelf was so EASY to put together, in less than 5 minutes. It's strong and nice looking. Not what I expected but The top covers didn‚Äôt come in package to cover top shelf... if it did this is easily a 4 to 5 star book shelf for the price so it‚Äôs low on my score since four pieces to cover top were missing This shelf is very sturdy and looks good Perfect for my laundry room for a little stuff I wish the shelves were made out of plastic, not wood. A few of the shelves were damaged on the corners due to how this product is shipped, but I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it. Other then that it is a decent shelving system for the price. Assembly was simple.  Perfect for lightweight storage. Two of the shelves were cracked and chipped around the bored hole so I didn't dare tighten them.  Because of this it's not very sturdy. Very flimsy. Will not hold anything too heavy but I wanted it for knick knacks. So it works great for that Easy to assemble, took me maybe 5 minutes to put together. I use it as a toy shelf for my sons toy baskets and it holds it well. Pretty sturdy and aesthetically pleasing. This was easy to put together and amazingly sturdy for the price. Doesn't match the dimensions. Bought it thinking it was a tall sturdy shelf for food and dishes. Not happy, hopefully I can sell it instead of sending it back. Reason for the one star review is for the price.  This is not worth $50, more like $20.  It was easy enough to put together and the size I expected (please check the measurements as it looks a lot bigger in the pictures than it really is), but the quality is so so cheap. Product description says that capacity is 25 pounds per shelf,but directions that cone with the product state that capacity is ONLY 15 pounds per shelf.A little disappointing.I need to re-think how I will place items on the shelves. it wobble Fast, prompt service. Extremely easy to assemble! Perfect for what I needed! Sturdy. Fit perfectly where I needed it."
32,"Garmin 010-01689-00 Forerunner 35; Easy-to-Use GPS Running Watch, Black",Electronics,"Doesn‚Äôt accurately take my heart rate. Died in less than a year. After a year it no longer stays synced to my phone and it definitely does not track heart rate accurately during runs, rendering it pretty much useless- if I wanted mileage alone I could have stuck with using my phone. F35 is NOT compatible with Samsung Galaxy S21.  Messages, Incomings calls ETC are NOT displayed."
33,"Garmin 010-02064-00 Instinct, Rugged Outdoor Watch with GPS, Features Glonass and Galileo, Heart Rate Monitoring and 3-Axis Compass, Graphite",Electronics,"I returned this watch. After wearing for 4 days it burned my arm valuable  product, very good function. I bought this for the hubby before buying one myself.  I love the following:- answering cell phone or rejecting a call at the push of one button. This is wonderful while wearing your AirPods and have no idea where your phone is, or don‚Äôt want to dig it out of your bag.- female: mensural tracking! It‚Äôs absolutely accurate and gives you a day warning if you choose that setting on the app.-  weather, sleep, heart rate, steps, (and more)- lasts for days on one charge- has a fun ‚Äútrack me‚Äù option so you can reverse your activity. Very impressed with Battery life Great watch to learn from with respect to navigating and orientation. Disappointed on battery life. Three to four days vs the seven or longer they advertise. The Good:If you're active outdoors and just want to see some data this device is great (whether casual or serious training).  I use it for running, trail running, hiking, and walking.  Plan to test biking in the near future.  The GPS tracking is very accurate and I can clearly see on the mapping afterwards if I took any detours, even minor ones.The Bad:For the first 1.5 months of ownership I was thrilled with the product and wished I had owned it 10 years ago (or whenever it first became available).  The watch required a charge roughly every 2 weeks.  But all of a sudden the battery starting lasting 2-3 days tops - and I have not changed my routine or settings.  The charger interface is proprietary so buying more/carrying them around is very inconvenient.  Not only that but every time you charge you lose time on collecting statistics.  I have all these gaps in my records now compared to before where there was an occasional few hours outage.The Ugly:I've always been a fan of Garmin products going back to automobile GPS 15 years ago.  But the support I've received about the battery life issue is more than disappointing.  I really feel they couldn't care less about my issue.  Rather than recommending this product I now say proceed with caution.  I honestly would not have bought the product knowing I need to charge it every other day. This watch fits perfectly on my large wrist. Feels durable and sync easily to my Samsung phone. They make tempered glass screen protectors for this watch so, I'm not worried about scratches while hunting and fishing. Everything works great except temperature reading.  Bluetooth does not update the temp automatically.  I have to turn the watch off, then back on + Cycle Bluetooth on my iPhone. + manual update from the connect app on my iPhone,  Time between battery charges is very long.  Think I plug it in overnight about twice a month. Tried several times during my workout ro get the heart rate sensor to work but it just continues to frustrate.  Read all advise on how to fix. It tells time and does everything else. So there's that. Great battery life, works well with App that has some great motivating features for fitness.  Bought it for adventure and GPS tracking but now use it every day for fitness tracking.  Highly recommend. Use this for work and I‚Äôm not easy on it. Very durable. It's fine. Watch looks great, does everything it needs to, besides one BIG reason why I got this watch from the beginning. WILL NOT RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGE ALERTS! I‚Äôve done everything I found online, but literally nothing works. I read in a few places that it is because of the IOS 13 update. Ever since they updated their phones, they stopped receiving text notification. If I would‚Äôve known this before purchasing, I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased because I had already done the update. Other than that, I loved everything else about it. But will be returning. Long battery life, averaging 3weeks. Easy to use, and I like the styling. Pretty cool toy There is definitely a learning curve in using this type of watch.  Probably navigating the menus is the main issue but if you keep playing with it, you will eventually figure it out.I love that you can set up multiple alarms for particular days, the week, or just weekends.I love that you can set up multiple countdown timers.I love that you can configure the face.I love that you can set your quick menusIt tells you your location.You can set up a world of mapping during events but I have yet to explore this.I still have so much more to learn about this watch but it's battery time is CRAZY long!  I love that I can use it for the week or more without recharging and then completely charge it overnight.It tells you your level of sleep which I like as an added perk.While it does your steps and heart beat, it doesn't do your BP or oxygen use but it pretty much does everything else.I am giving it 5 stars as it does quite a bit of things that I need it for but it doesn't do blood pressure or oxygen use...which I would use.  I'm going to round up to 5 stars but I'm going to give it 4.5 stars since it doesn't do BP and Oxygen and it doesn't light up when you tilt your wrist.Overall a happy purchase. Received a quickly repacked used watch, unacceptable. Love this watch. I was a G-Shock watch guy for decades and this watch is my new favorite. Watch works very well and the battery lasts great.  User interface is difficult and a bit confusing but a great activity tracker/smart watch. First one I received had a defective battery. Second one has been an incredible watch. Love this! It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever wanted or could ask for in a watch, however, I do not get text notifications and have not been able to figure out what is wrong.. so that is my only complaint.. Great battery life Light weight,  does everything like it should The watch functions are great. The only thing I don't like about the watch is the color. When I seen it on the website it looked gray. When I browsed through other Garmin watches they were more expensive. So I am stuck with this color. I will call it my ugly watch. I ordered myself a different colored wrist band, slate is the color and it look lot better than the sea foam color. I am now quite satisfied with the watch. Excelente!! Got it for my son and he seems to like it a lot! Don‚Äôt waste your money. Heart rate isn‚Äôt  accurate, settings are hard to function.  I have had it just under a month and now the watch won‚Äôt charge.  Tried to get away from Apple....but maybe having to go back. I think this watch is great. If you are looking for a watch with a lot of features or graphics, this watch probably isn't for you.  It isn't touch screen so that takes a little while to get used to.  But I like this watch for 2 reasons.  First, you don't have to charge it every day. I can go a week sometimes without having to charge this watch. Second, I don't think you can break it. It is very strong and has withstood a lot of activity. Other than that it is pretty straightforward. Nothing fancy, but great if you are wanting to use it for telling time and checking messages so you don't have to pull out your phone every time it beeps. Also good for keeping track of your workouts. Bought it for tracking my windsurfing sessions. It does not have a special app for windsurfing like more expensive garmins, but I was able to add one manually using phone buttons and design my own watch face with current speed showing in largest part of screen, current time, total distance (all I needed). Can easily see speed when planing fast over waves (speeds ~25mph).GPS works great, but I wish it would have mode that measures every second, in normal mode it skips some when it thinks speed is not changing much.Pulse meter is pretty much useless when exercising, at least in my case. It works well if your hand is still, but when you shake it or just move around rate jumps by ~20 beats (checked with more reliable finger pulse meter). No matter how tight I have my watch. I guess it has some logic to filter out pulse signal, but since my normal resting pulse is lower than usual (just 45 bmp) perhaps it picks up noise. On the other hand I am not interested in this number at all. Fenix 6 is probably better, but at 3 times the price... Especially with windsurfing, I have already lost a couple of gopros :-) Very easy set up the Garmin appset everything up and it's nice to see all your watch functions on your phone Nice product.  Does the job. Great gift for person who flys aircraft or does lots of hiking and he does both. This perfect for my training and anything else I do outdoors. The apps are a perfect compliment to the watch as well. Tons of info that you can use. Great battery life.  Accurate on all counts.  Great watch.  I didn't give it 5 stars because twice I've started the app on my iphone 8 and found it didn't recognize that I'd already set it up.  Finding the app in install mode when trying to connect to the watch was pathetic.  But, great watch! Please do not buy this watch if measuring your heart rate during activities is important to you.  I take the same hike every week and the sensor on some days just fails to register the proper hr.  Sometimes the max is 155 and sometimes it's 90s for the same pace/hike/distance, etc.  When talking with Garmin customer service, they've repeatedly told me this is functioning as intended.  Which is to say, sometimes the hr monitor works properly, and sometimes it does not, and that is how Garmin sees this as functioning as intended. So.. the battery life is pretty fantastic. I'll give it that.But the functionality is junk.For starters, the button nav is confusing and unintuitive.But how it works is where everything really goes to hell.So for starters, the notification app that tells you you've received a notification is really dumb.  It just fires you the first bunch of characters from the notification itself.  Those first few characters are often your account name or the program that's firing off the notification, so until you grab your phone, you have absolutely no idea who messaged/texted/emailed/whatevered you or what the content might be.  Because the notification is just something like, Google Chat - <your account name>.Then, there's the fact that if you're busy doing something and ignoring your phone, notifications come in periodically, and if you ignore them, the watch will re-remind you over and over of the same notification you've already received.  The app makes no effort to remember which notifications it's sent to the watch already, so every time a new notification comes in, you get all of the old ones all over again. Awesome.But here's the one that *really* annoys me.  The watch has a, 'move monitor', which will tell you you need to move every hour if it thinks you haven't moved enough in the last hour.  This would be somewhat useful (maybe) if it weren't horribly broken.I've received move notifications while standing 20 feet in the air on a ladder installing siding.  I've received a move notification while actively moving 10s of thousands of points of heavy, muddy dirt in my back yard with a shovel.  It's laughably broken and thus useless. The only thing is that the altitude stopped to work properly in the first month. Is always showing the last altitude you ask.I will ask for warranty now. This watch I got is not Solar powered it was advertised as such. But just found out you need to buy the more expensive watch. I bought this over a month ago, really liked the reviews out there. From an overall fitness watch perspective, it is good, but unfortunately, I paid premium for the piece of junk which is Solar. It doesnt do anything for the watch. You charge it fully, it shows 24 days worth of charge, then use it one day and dont use it for like 2-3 days, everything drains out, like blank screen. I dont understand how can a charge worth 24 days leak in 2 days. If it was non-solar I am at least not paying addition 200 bucks for a piece of technology which is non-existent. If you must, go for the normal version, but burn your hard earned money on Solar Instinct. Straight out of the box it was broken and could not charge or connect to a pc through the charging port. Where I am from it is too expensive to send the item back so at my own cost I have to cover the repair for an item that was broken when I received it.BEWARE! Fantastic watch! This may be the best thing yet, but I am having a hard time figuring out how it works. There are videos on the web but they leave out most of the details. And for some unknown reason the watch tells me in the middle of the night that I have received spam on my smart phone! Give me a break. And what is it measuring? It tells me I am running low on energy. How can it tell? How does it distinguish deep sleep from light sleep and from REM sleep? I researched Garmin watches extensively and settled on the Instinct. I purchased it in October of 2020 and it lasted until May of 2021. The watch has all the features I needed and performed very well.Heart rate sensor was accurate.Barometric altimeter was accurate.GPS was accurate.Battery life is superb.Unfortunately after 7 months of owning it, the screen face cracked spontaneously why I was mowing my yard. Not sure what happened. I don't remember knocking my hand against anything that would have cracked the screen.So now the watch is no longer waterproof and the crack obscures the seconds counter and the small circular LCD on the top right of the face.If you buy one, get Amazon's accidental breakage warranty and be sure to purchase a screen protector. I don‚Äôt see the use of this GPS watch for a serious athletes. Maybe for someone who wants to see stats. Night visibility while running is subpar and screen is hard to read. After 4-5 months of use, the battery last less than 24 hours. Very dissapointed of this brand. So works fine as a watch and recharges quickly but heart rate monitor barely works half the time, super inaccurate when recording distance on my hikes and the gps hasn't been useful once. Definitely regret the purchase Not user friendly, random screen changes, command sequence random.Would not rebuy. Altitude and barometer are horrible Too complicated to use. The manual is confusing and almost worthless. I intend on selling it and going back to a FitBit. Very disappointed. Bought this as a gift and This watch was returned because it was way to complicated to use. Too many things to turn on and off solar part could not keep up with the watch charging. Watch looks nice, seems durable. Doesn‚Äôt update fast enough: eg ( temp on phone says 65 degrees out, I know it‚Äôs actually 80; watch hasn‚Äôt caught up) now a few months in only partially connects to my phone, gives messages but says not connected for everything else and won‚Äôt show up in the app. For a $400 watch I expected much more Great watch and a great look!  Difficult to get used to if you‚Äôve never had one, but once you figure it out it gets easier. Definitely worth it.  Wish it had VO2 max. This thing has plenty of battery. Love it!!! Where is daily and love it. Excellent watch. Everything I wanted in a smart watch including long battery life, great workout features, precision gps. I only wish Garmin would make it out of another material as I am allergic to the current material being used. i love this watch , its durable and simple the only downside in my case i have an i phone 12 pro max and when i walk out side and leave my phone in my house the watch does not pair back up with my phone when i come back in i have to go to setting on my phone turn off bluetooth then turn it back on so my watch can get notifications again other than that its an great watch!! The lower price of this item is evidently because it is the Asia Pacific version. This is not necessarily a deal-breaker because it has an English menu as well as Thai, Bahasa, Vietnamese, etc, and it seems to work well. But it came with firmware v2.90 when the latest release is v8.60. Using the Garmin Express app, I updated to the latest available version for this APAC model - v7.10. So I'm still behind the latest. I fault the vendor for not making clear that this is not a ROW model, and may decide to return it. The box was open and the sensor was running, battery last mere 14 hours after full recharge. Disappointed with the purchase. Ordered a replacement and will update my review on this again. Pathetic has just powered off after 3 months I have had a number of Garmin watches and Baught this one as all I needed was1) Location Co ordinates2) Distance3) Av Walking Speed .4) Battery LifeThe price looked great but the confusion of getting into the GPS and stopping has driven me crazy .I will in future prob try another manufacturer Awesome product, super durable, great battery and I love the design. The GPS elevation reader was a bit off when I took it on a 14er but besides that it‚Äôs awesome Watch out for APAC models (Asia Pacific).  I noticed mine was an APAC when I plugged it into Garmin Express to sync/charge.  I believe this affects future firmware updates from Garmin and possibly satellite connection times.  Returned it since I'm in US.Other than that it's a great device.  Very light.  Very easy to read the display.  Snappy and responsive.  Quick to connect to phone app.  Wrist HRM is so so but on par with other devices I've had. I have only had it for 3 months. But I moved to Africa with it and put it through the ringer and it works great. It has a longer battery life than an Apple Watch and doesn‚Äôt over heat when you have it in the sun like an Apple Watch. It looks rugged and over all I think it‚Äôs great for the price Worked Great first time, but it  is hard to reset to the same settings. I think I just need to play with watch more and figur√® it out. This is my second Garmin Instinct as the first one was stolen. I have watched several videos and printed out the full users manual as it‚Äôs got a lot of features I would never have figured out otherwise!  I love it for some safety features, such as track back, compass, weather alerts, that work even outside of cell service.  It is rugged and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it if I get caught in the rain. With my first one, I disabled the cell phone/text notifications, but this time, I just limited it to texts and calls and find that it is really nice to get a silent alert and read a text without having to dig out my phone. It also helps on a hike where I might not have cell service most of the way to get an alert when I do get service so that if I want to send a status update I can.  I don‚Äôt have to check my phone for service periodically. Little things and big. Battery life is good and am be extended by limiting certain functions. I used all functions on a 12 hour trip and it drained about half the battery. I‚Äôd recommend getting a second charging cord as it does not use any of the common ends. The idiot who stole my first one left the cord, so I have two. Watch would not charge after second charge. Terrible navigation features on watch. I‚Äôve taken this on a few hiking trips now and it‚Äôs as good as a Fitbit when they first came out. The weather only works when you have your phone app open and connected, and other functions are either off or won‚Äôt work unless you have the phone app open. I‚Äôm disappointed that I bought this. Best watch I have ever own, keeps heart rate, GPS coordinates, solar power..what else can I ask for,  incredible watch for the outdoor person I wouldn't call it a smart watch without the touch screen. its heart rate sensor is very reliable and accurate. A bit complicated My husband loves this watch! The charge last for days. It is a little difficult to learn how to use but he's working on it. I must say that I am quite disappointed with the GPS accuracy. On a measured 10 mile run it is always off by about a mile. Other than that, the watch is comfortable, looks good, and the heart rate monitor is very precise. Like this better than my previous Garmin vivioactive 3. The Instinct is less stylish but that matters little. The touch screen on the vivo turned out to be annoying, not usable if you're not sitting still... and I want to track activities. Extra buttons on Instinct are much more practical.. Finally and most importantly the Instinct has almost 10x the charge life. I've had several Garmins over the years.  From the Forerunner 305, 410, 220, 235, Vivoactive and now the Instinct.  I even bought a Garmin 25 for my bike.  I love Garmin and have only had one bad experience with one of their products, the FR410.  It was by far the worst product they ever had and they discontinued it pretty quickly after seeing how bad it was.  Since then they have redeemed themselves.  The 305 had to by my favorite followed by the 220 and 235.  The only reason I like the newer products now is for the smart features and being able to see notifications from my phone.  I've always wanted a Fenix but after some of the reviews said it doesn't track steps very well and some of the earlier versions didn't have an auto upload to your phone.  I have an incentive program through my insurance at work and step tracking and work out uploads are useful.  As I said when I got the 220 it was the last thing I need to stop using my computer to upload runs.So why the Instinct?  Well like I said I always wanted a Fenix but didn't like the high price.  This was available at a discount and I used those incentive points from my program to buy this.  I also work in a factory and wanted something a little more durable.  The 235 was fine with a tempered screen glass and a rubber surround but I would sometimes break the glass.  This will be more durable than any other watch because of the lip surrounding the face.  You can buy a rubber surround for that lip but I'm going to hold off for now.  I did buy a tempered screen protector for it.As far as the functions go this is the same as any other Garmin.  I set the screens when I run to the same settings, it seems to measure distance the same, I don't use the heart rate monitor to save on battery life.  If you've ever owned a Garmin watch they are pretty much the same.  I've always loved what this watch does in it's purest form, give time, distance and pace.  That's all the 305 did and that all you really need.Now for the things that are difference with this watch that the others I've owned.  First the good.  Like I said it seems more rugged, looking like a old Casio or G-Shock watch with a fat lip.  The band it really comfortable and seem better than the 235 band that I replaced eventually with some more durable than the original.  The band also had a curve to it which makes it a little easier to put on.  It's nice looking and easy to see.  I always change the look to a black on white background but that's my preference, it does come with black on white.  I like the gray color.  It has a stronger vibration than watches past.  The back light is good.  The way your can customize the widgets is pretty cool.  I normally don't flip between then very often but it's nice to know what the weather is doing or check notifications and such.  I like the compass feature and can't wait to use it in the woods.  I like the barameter feature and have that at the upper left corner of the home screen.  If you know the higher the pressure the better the weather the lower the pressure the chance of rain etc.  Overall just a sold watch.Now the bad and by no means are these major issues it's just preference.  I'm not a fan of the front screen layout.  Especially with the small round screen at the upper right corner. On the 235 I had an analog type watch display that was great and this has similar options but it's not that useable because of that smaller display on that corner.  So your pretty much going to use the digital which is just fine but I would have like to use the analog.  The settings are okay to getting around and there are a lot features you probably won't use much if at all.  It takes some getting used to navigate and can be a little cumbersome.  I would suggest using the button lock feature.  I noticed that more often that previous watches I'll look down and it's searching for a GPS signal when I accidently hit the button to do so.  As one person has said the buttons are good but the two the right side don't stick out as much as the ones on the left side of the watch.  Since you use the upper right button the most I could see it getting worn out but time will tell.Overall if you are wanting more GPS features like a compass and tracking abilities and don't want to spend the extra on the Fenix this is for you.  If you just want a normal running or biking watch I would recommend any of the Forerunner models of Garmin watches.Update 5-3-21:So far it's been a good watch.  I typically only use the running feature but I do own a bike and some day might use it instead of using my Garmin Edge 25.  Seems to record steps okay.  All I need a Garmin for us running and step count and it does those well.  As for the other features I like smart notifications while I'm working.  Other than all those features the rest are extra.  I used the track me feature one time when I went hiking with our youth group.  Haven't really had the need to use any other feature.  It's held up well to the abuse that I can give it at work.  I work in manufacturing so it sometimes get a little dirty but so far nothing major.The one problem I have that made me almost send it back.  I had an issue with it freezing.  I noticed one day that the time was frozen and while hitting buttons would not switch screens or do anything.  I then turned off the watch and turned it back on and all was good.  It's done this maybe once a month since I've owned it.  Not a big deal but annoying to say the least.  I know two guys at work that have the same watch and don't have this issue.  Might be a defect should have sent it back but didn't.  If any of ya'll have the same issue please let me know.  Other than that it's been a great watch. The band is so soft and comfortable and there are so many different excerise options. I bought it for my 15 year old grandson . He picked it out for his birthday and he loves it. That's all I need. Working in construction I basically just needed a rugged watch that could stand the abuse, elements and have good battery life while feeding me important info without taking my phone out as much.. This watch does all of these tasks very well.. Its also very light and comfortable. HOWEVER, while driving commercial trucks/heavy equipment, itll register as not only walking, but climbing flights of stairs.. So I'm smashing fitness goals without actually doing any fitness! the same goes for the heart rate sensor. I dont honestly use much else and my old Samsung watch had these similar draw backs. Little disappointed in this watch.  I bought it mostly for the heart rate monitor and now this seems like a mistake.  It is wildly inaccurate.  I‚Äôve tried different tightnesses on the wristband and different locations on my wrist.  I get all sorts of inaccurate readings.  I like the display options, the comfortable wristband and the style of the watch.  The battery life is excellent too.  I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm going to keep it due to the extreme heart rate inaccuracies though. A few things I had issues with, one if the watch is tight on my wrist and I move my wrist it can hit the buttons and put the watch in different modes. I found it difficult to navigate the watch. I needed to watch a few videos. I still forget some of the modes. Regular use of features gives you about 5 days worth of battery life. Fairly accurate with tracking Heart Rate Variability, sleep, swimming laps, GPS. Its comfortable to wear and extremely customizable to your liking. Works amazing in the pool. It did not last two weeks!! Given its price point, this has generally been a reliable device, but for its relatively unreliable wrist-based HR reading.  After carefully cleaning and shaving my wrist -- and thoroughly cleaning the back of the device -- HR readings seem to be reliable about 50% of the time (when not reliable, reading is at about 50% of actual HR).  I also use a Polar chest strap paired with my Android phone -- this seems relatively accurate about 99% of the time.  I have experimented with band tightness -- with no apparent variation in the extent to which, or frequency with which readings are generally inaccurate.  I have  accepted the likelihood that my physiology is probably responsible for this lack of reliability and will probably add a Garmin chest strap to this device in order to boost reliability.  Otherwise, GPS is more consistently reliable than location by simple cell tower triangulation.  Also, battery life is solid, lasting about 4-5  days if not used in GPS mode. Owned a Fitbit Surge for a number of years which worked remarkably well, including wrist-based HR that seemed to be consistently accurate within about 5%.  Regrettably, the Surge band was not replaceable, and I ultimately took to repairing the band with rubber cement, old inner tubes, bicycle spokes and zip ties.  The Instinct's replaceable band is a welcome change.  The take-home is that, as expected, there's really no substitute for a monitor that reads an electrical signal through the skin. Very nice watch, just very disappointing battery life. I have reset to factory default settings and still need to charge daily. Two months and no problems, all functions work great. -The watch had significant facial defects-Poor communication with seller-Lengthy return/reimbursement Worked great & highly enjoyed, but after only 5 months it won't charge. Replacement for a Forerunner 35, looking for better cycling distance accuracy. Didn't get it. Decent watch though I had to purchase the Speed Sensor 2 to get the distance cycling accuracy where it should be. Given it can read 2 different GPS signals at the same time thought it would be more accurate than it is mountain biking as is but it's not. REGRET not getting the Sunburst or red or anything other than black, you can't read the bezel info or face printing except in strong light. The colored watches have great looking contrast but the black on black bezel, and gray on black face printing are too hard to see in real life. White or a bright color would have made this one more useful. Sleep tracking is not very good but it isn't on most smart watches. Temperature is useless. Time & date are easy to see. Battery life is outstanding though again, Garmin's own proprietary charging plug on this one, don't lose it if you get one. Having sunset time displayed is kinda handy. Counting the flights of stairs you climb each day is handy for me, I average 15+ a day. Heart rate sensor is probably the best of all Garmin products I've used. I had a Garmin heart rate chest strap I used with my Edge 500 and 3 times with my Forerunner, it was all over the place around industrial areas & power lines. I really don't think my heart rate hit 285. The Forerunner 35 HR was good, this one seems more accurate and I have yet to have any HR readings that look out of place. Given the price, features, Garmin Connect app, battery life, it is a really good value. Just hard to read. I work graveyard in a warehouse so I don't see to much sunlight for the solar charging of the battery. But with heart monitor and the activity tracker on 24-7, I get a little over a week with a single charge. Love this watch! Takes a beating in a warehouse and still looks great after 3 months of use. Battery life is way underestimated! US military goes Garmin. I wear it every day. Thought about the Solar Tactical, but outside of stealth mode being a cool feature, I wasn‚Äôt planning on jumping out of a lot of planes, so the Instinct Solar it was. Light weight, extremely durable, comfortable, synced to my iPhone with zero issues. Lots of great YouTube tutorials for all its functions. The only con is it doesn‚Äôt go well with a suit, but hey, not why I bought it. Connect App has run smoothly for me. Only addition I made was a screen protector, for the oh crap moments, and it‚Äôs practically invisible. Very inaccurate in terms of heart rate and altimeter. Don't recommend it. The product is nice. Good quality Garmin product. Got this to track my triathalon and Ironman trainings. It works with solar chargingand the battery is good. I have been gettin around 2 weeks of battery with heavy use and pretty much all notifications and battery using apps. Still to go on an expedition,will try that mode soon. I wanted something different than the Apple that everyone has. I realize the Instinct doesn‚Äôt do half of what the Apple does but I mainly wanted a rugged watch that I could get messages and GPS.  Although it only takes 20 min or less to charge I would have like to have gotten the solar but I‚Äôm a cheap skate and didn‚Äôt want to spend the extra $100 for that feature.  I would recommend and would buy the Instinct again in a second. The reps and weights app. Can be a pain. Very difficult to navigate, no easy to get from menu to menu. Can be very frustrating. I bought the Solar version thinking it would be best for the battery life in October. In January the battery went completely to dead in about 5 hours from fully charged. I did all of the resets and nothing helped. I did contact Garmin and they are replacing but I am wary of spending this much and having such a poor product. If you want the full use of the watch without having to charge constantly then the solar seems like a necessity but if the battery life isn't good like mine was, you'll be highly disappointed. No Chinese. The map input can not work accuracy. When I run, I found the route shown was not right. Maybe the Gps need update. Kept disconnecting and kept having to delete the app and reinstall for it to work with iPhone 7 properly after 16th time I gave up and returned it. Garmin watches are not very friendly for third party programmers. What is monkey c lol? Also api terms are confusing just make it open source and coding for your product will be easier. Watch works fine. Great watch for tracking biometrics, it's software can be kind of a pain sometimes but it's battery life and biometric tracking are unbelievable. As a runner I enjoy looking over my statistics and it goes pretty in-depth. I wanted to be reminded to get up and move around.This watch does that.It is supposed to remind you every fifteen minutes.It does not.it will remind you in another hour.The altimeter is a disgrace. It works off air pressure. My driveway has maybe +/- 12 feet. This watch shows hundreds of feet in elevation change due to wind.We have a two story home. My iPhone does a good job recording stairs. The Garmin does not. Manual suggests, don't carry anything, don't use the handrail. Seriously? Don't use the handrail?I have a real GPS. The location is good.To sync to your smartphone you have to go to the server. Garmin recently got hacked by malware. Seriously bad IT security, they should be ashamed of themselves. During the 5 or six days they were down there was no ability to sync your watch.Syncing with the server drains my iPhone liked I used it to start my car. I was goofing around with the app when the watch was new and drained the phone from 70% to 34% before I knew what had happened. The battery drain is on the order of 1%/minute while you are in the app. I found out the Garmin app pushes the data to the apple health app. The Garmin app has some nice features, but it will suck your battery down.Sometimes the phone shows I'm asleep when I watch a movie and awake when I'm in bed. If you fall asleep and get up, it does not show the first couple of hours. It works well if you go to bed and go to sleep. Short interruptions for bathroom breaks don't confuse it. Much more than that and it gets confused. You can go back and manually enter the time. I took a two hour nap yesterday. It didn't record that as sleep.Heart rate monitor seems to be very good. I like that feature.The watch was off nine seconds yesterday from the national time standard. I had not checked GPS location in about two weeks. That's how the time gets reset. That's not too bad either.Battery life seems to be great. It's supposed to last two weeks the way I use it. I don't use the GPS except to set the time. I take the watch off to shower and it's fully charged when I'm done. That's probably not good for the battery, but it's convenient for me.Garmin has their own system of icons. They appear to be secrets. I have been unable to find a coherent list of icon to English. The standard watch face has four hours of heart rate, day and date, time (seconds display for a while when you roll the watch to look at it) battery status and some weird three benches stacked in a triangle. It took me several hours to find out that was the time for local sunrise and sunset. Great feature, seriously poor documentation, how hard is it to include in the damn tech manual? IT'S AN ON LINE MANUAL!Like I started with it does a good job of reminding me to get up. Great would be doing what it claimed. I found the watch disappointing after 8 months of daily use--- plus also used for hiking PCT section A  CA.FITBIT was more user friendlyAlso  disappointing as GPS watch.I purchased this watch to use for hiking and section hiking.I also purchased the TEMPE also thinking I could use that also to tell me what the temperature was with out taking the watch off for 20 mins.The Tempe only works when your are in a activity tracking mode.  So no quick checking of how warm or cold it is on the fly. Also drains the battery when out on a hike and checking progress.The sleep tracking was not as good as fitbit --IMHOIt has a built in compass which was great, and the storm alert feature also good.The sunrise sunset feature is also great if you‚Äôre are planning to be up hiking at dawn or getting to a tent site before dark.Extra handy that you can pair it with your Garmin mini and use the watch to trigger SOS beacon.All changes to the watch must be made via the watch face using the control buttons not using the Garmin Connect app.  Connect app needs a serious update.  PHD in  watch control would be helpful also. Garmin needs to update user interface. The buttons are mounted such that there is no way to avoid pressing them with a shirt sleeve, glove edge, or just moving the wrist its on. This leads to turning the GPS on which drains the batteries in a few hours.I don't recommend this watch and I would not buy it again. Won‚Äôt even power on when brand new.  After being supposedly charged.....A gift that has to be returned.  Super bummed. Doesn't have all the extra bells and whistles of other phones but makes up for it with battery life.If you are like me and looking for a long lasting watch to record athletic activities and sleep patterns but don't need a lot of custom faces and/or apps then it is probably exactly what you are looking for I was looking for a GPS watch and it was a toss up between this, the Garmin Fenix 5 or the Suunto Traverse. I chose this due to the price and some of the great reviews it‚Äôs been receiving on YouTube. I think I made the right choice. Imagine the Garmin Fenix with all the flashy bits stripped back and just the essential functions left in.This is a product that does most things really well and some things pretty badly. The things it does well are the elements that revolve around hiking and walking outdoors. It has some advanced features that are genuinely helpful when out on the trail or up a mountain.GPS Functionality-Amazingly this watch has virtually replaced my handheld GPS device. Even though it doesn‚Äôt have maps, the route can be clearly seen on the screen in bright sunlight or dark cloud and you will feel a buzz as soon as you veer off course. The arrow will point you in the right direction and you will feel a buzz as soon as you‚Äôre back on course. We are only talking less than 10meters off course, so it‚Äôs really accurate. Furthermore when you are following a route you get lots of very important and life-saving information, like End of route ETA and sunset time. Essential when hiking in winter. The only time I‚Äôve had to refer back to my handheld is when a route double backs on itself, as it can be confusing to work out on the watch. I recommend planning routes using OS MAPS amazing mobile or online apps and then imported into Garmin Basecamp. Avoid Garmin's Explore app as it‚Äôs glitchy and sadly lacking in functionality.Sensors -Most of the information the watch gives you from the sensors seems accurate apart from the step count. Altitude, barometer, temperature all seem okay.User interface and experience-If you like flashy graphics then you‚Äôll be disappointed, but if you like simplicity and functionality then the  user interface is perfect. It‚Äôs easy to work with and the fact that the watch has buttons means you can navigate through the functions with gloves on, which is a huge advantage over a touchscreen. The watch itself is very light so you forget you‚Äôre even wearing it most of the time.Battery lifeThe battery life is good. If you just use it as a watch it‚Äôll go a week or two without needing a charge. With the GPS on expect the watch to last a day of hiking, charging is also very fast, so even if it runs out of juice you can easily replenish using a small power pack when taking a coffee break.Now for the negatives...Most of the negatives surround Garmin's software which is why I have given this watch 3 stars. Garmin really needs to simplify and update their accompanying software for their devices as the whole ecosystem is a mess.For the instinct you have 3 pieces of software, yes 3 that you need to get your head around if you want to use the watch to it‚Äôs full potential. Furthermore the mapping apps -Explore and Basecamp are just awful and take a lot of trial and error before you can be sure to trust that your watch has the correct maps loaded and they actually work.Garmin‚Äôs accompanying Explore App is sadly missing some essential features that Hikers tend to rely upon, namely GPX import/export and the ability to send your planned routes to friends and family via text or email. The app is also be a bit glitchy, I‚Äôve spent ages planning routes only to find that they can‚Äôt sync with the watch so I tend to use Garmin‚Äôs antiquated Basecamp app on the PC as it‚Äôs more reliable and has all the functionality I need, but it looks and feels like it was designed in the 1990‚Äôs.Sadly Garmin don‚Äôt seem to want to deal with the sorry state of their Apps so that significantly lowers the score on this watch as there are apps for the Apple Watch like WorkOutDoors that actually works so much better than anything Garmin have. That‚Äôs crazy considering Garmin manufacture hardware.Tracks not RoutesGarmin has 3 ways of creating and saving routes - You have a ‚Äòtrack‚Äô and a ‚Äòroute‚Äô, you also have an ‚ÄòActivity‚Äô this is really confusing and compounded by the fact that the Instinct watch can handle tracks but not routes, though it won‚Äôt tell you until you get to your hole location and the watch just doesn‚Äôt load your Map/Course/Activity/track (whatever they want to call it) This is infuriating as there really is no explanation as to why there is a difference and sometimes their own software gets confused and makes a total mess of things when you try to work with routes. My advice, just work with tracks, not routes. Garmin are seriously letting their product down by producing such bad software.Final verdict -Now I‚Äôve lived with the watch for few months and I‚Äôve worked out how to use the apps and software, I can honestly say that it has become an essential piece of hiking kit. I wear it every day and really enjoy owning and using it. Bought this watch for my husband. He's a hunter and does a lot of fishing. He loves it and has been using it during his workouts as well. He says the GPS feature will come in handy this fall if he has to track any deer in the woods! I love the Garmin watches, fitbits kept breaking on me so i got a vivoactive 4 which was great but it broke too but lasted a lot longer. So now this watch I spent extra for the solar in it and after a few months yeah you don't really need the solar part its pretty cool though and does help last longer just a little.Now the reason i got this because it's thermal, shock and water resistant up to 100m. I was debating over this and a smart g-shock I stuck with Garmin for the features I don't go to the gym often but it does work well as a sports tracker the altimeter in it was a bit weird at first but they fixed most of that issue in an update but the little hole for it is right on your wrist so it can get covered up easily but dont really care about that. The gps works well and it runs a bit slow but it works it just takes a minute.I beat up my watches a lot so this was good for me I mixed cement on a roof of a city buildings this summer and this thing has taken the abuse like a champ its been hit with a power washer too the guys at work were having fun it sucks with 100¬∫F. Oh and the battery is fanatic I wanted a basic smart watch but this does everything and has all the tracking of the vivo active its even alerted me of storms coming in and it saved our buts on the roof to dodge the rain. The way i have mine set it lasts 23 days and yep it sure does. Even wore it to a water park.  I was worried about it not being touch screen but i quickly forgot about that. I pretty much never take it off except to charge itIf you need a smart watch that can take abuse with a very customize able look, tracking for your workouts, phone connected, this is a solid watch I love it. You can skip the solar part save some yourself some money there Overall great product! I feel like there are a lot of bells and whistles that your average user will never take advantage of, but really not a fault. It does occasionally take a bit to connect to my phone but as far the watch itself goes. I‚Äôve been very happy. I haven‚Äôt used it but seems to work for my husband and so far doing well with the roughness he puts it through! Had loads of problems with the watch freezing so sent it back really disappointing When I purchased this watch 5 months ago, I had high hopes this watch would exceed my expectations. Unfortunately, the product did not live up to the reviews I read or videos I watch.  I am an avid hiker, biker and swimmer and was hoping I would have directionally accurate data from the watch and a reasonable time between charges.  Accuracy - the heart rate can be directionally accurate at times and then other times completely in accurate.  I can go out for a hike and start up mountain gaining elevation my heart is pumping and look at the heart rate (on the watch) and see it is reading 68 which isn't possible.  I stop and count my rate and find it over 100.  Also, it rarely reports the high number to the ap correctly.  I will be hiking and see a high of 150 and at the end when I review the data on the app the says my high was 138.  The elevation gain always reads way higher than it is.  I have another app on my phone (All Trails) that I compare to the watch and the phone will tell me I gained 2000 feet and the watch will say 3800 feet (not possible).  There are times when the watch time gets stuck at moment; I will look at the time and it says 9:32 and I realize that is not possible I look at my phone and sure enough its actually 10:30.  Once I push a couple of buttons on the watch it corrects itself.  If you want to have an accurate elevation from the compose you have to remember to always click ‚Äúfind GPS‚Äù it won‚Äôt do it on its own‚Ä¶no matter what setting you use.  Battery life ‚Äì forget what the reviews say or what Garmin promotes as long battery.  The life is all based on how long and how many activities you track in a given period.  The only way you can get 14 days is if you have no activities.  The battery last about 6 to 8 hours of activity.  There is a meter on the watch that shows you bars but don‚Äôt trust the bars it can show 3 bars and within a couple of hours I am running out of power.  What they should do is tell you how much time remains based on activities (they could do this in the app).  After 5 months I have started having the watch regularly stop tracking my heart rate in the app and in the watch.  It will report a number but the graph is gone and it does not report it to the phone.  I must reboot it two or three times to get it to work.  I have tried the cleaning instructions, but it hasn't helped at all.  If you are looking for a watch that is cool looking then this is it otherwise forget this watch. This took some getting used to but I'm better with it each day. I had a very cheap fitness tracker before that worked well for keeping track of steps and heart rate but was horrible at accurate sleep. This has many features, many I may never use but it keeps very good and accurate track of sleep, steps, heart rate and other things. I am now using it on  walks and hikes. It is nice that it gives you all the details such as a map of your actual route, elevation, miles traveled, heart rate etc...I am averaging about 15 days of battery life before recharging. It being winter and it is is always covered when I'm outside, I have not been able to take advantage of the solar charging yet. I could not get this watch to work properly! Yes, it kept time, and logged my steps. But, whenever I tried to use it to track my walking or hiking, it wasn‚Äôt accurate. I‚Äôm returning it. If i spend $300 on a product, I expect it to not break down and force me to spend multiple afternoons waiting on technical support within a year. Garmin support is call, leave a number and wait for a callback and you have to be close to a computer white the watch. It worked great for the first 10 months, great battery life although that did begin to slip but then one day refused to acquire satellites. Did not even last a year, pathetic. Wide range of features and will track sleep as well. Once you fumble your way thru programming ‚Äújust like every Garmin‚Äù it does work great! Love the watch.  Only gripe really is, why couldn't this watch have any diving features or programs?  It's rated for up to 100m depth like most watches.  Excellent battery life.  Pretty much 15 days with no GPS use.  Barometric pressure is usually within +-.02 inHg which is nice but needs sometime manual calibration every month or two.  Love the vibration alarm functions.  Haven't had any issues with the watch band like irritation or anything.  I washed it in dish soap before wearing.  Charging usb is interesting which is proprietary and also probably due to the depth rating for the watch.Overall really cool watch with some interesting features with the phone app.  One thing that is bad with it is that if the servers go down you won't be able to save any activities or review daily goals. I love this watch.  Easy to use.  Great app. Comfortable.  Great battery life.  Intuitive controls.  Looks good with any outfit.  Tough and durable.Can't say enough good things. Overall, it a good tracker for someone like me who does multi-sports and hikes. Battery life is good, watch is sturdy, and it has breadcrumbs mode which is cool if you hike in unfamiliar terrain and want a bit of preventive measures, i.e. knowing how to get back if you're lost.The problems I've noticed so far:- Heart rate monitor (when running) was dropping heart rate from around 140 to 80 and then slowly getting back to the right number, in about 10 min of running. That happened several times now, maybe every 10-15th run.- GPS over or under reports altitude. I had an activity where it thought I was 200+ meters under the sea level, or, in other activities, it gave me around 200-300+ meters more that comparing to Strava stats. This happens quite often to different degree of error.- This watch does not have VO2 sensor which I did not noticed when buying it, but many others Garmin trackers, including cheaper ones do have.- Storm Alert is useless. Had this feature on for many months, and according to it was very stormy (not really). I would say it was wrong in around 95% of times (or more).I'm not planning to change the watch though, since I can leave with its issues. Yes, this watch is more ruggedized but it would have been nice if it had all the features of the Forerunner 235. Since it was a more expensive watch, it should of had more of the same features as the Forerunner. If you want to flush over $300 down the toilet, buy this watch!  Since purchasing, I've taken the watch out on several hikes.  Before setting out, I draw out all of my routes in CalTopo and import into Gaia, so my mileage and cumulative elevation gain are known prior/after.  The watch is pretty worthless - reporting I did 7500' of gain when I only did 4400' of cumulative gain, reporting a total hiking distance of 0.07 miles when I did 9 miles, and reporting calorie burns that are a few thousand calories over what the norm would be.  Every single hike reports some value that's completely absurd, and it doesn't seem to matter whether I use GPS or no GPS.  The results are the same.  Altimeter seems to function at about +/- 300', although I have seen it off as much as 1000'.  Battery life, as others mention, is amazing, but who really cares given how poorly it performs in every other area.  Sadly, there's no return option through Amazon. The watch itself just feels cheap for the price you pay. Got water in it Bought as a gift for my boyfriend who destroyed his first two FitBits (that had rugged cases and screen protectors). It gets wet, dirty, scraped and nearly crushed daily but has held up remarkably well and he loves it! It works just like the day I bought it and he barely takes it off. I definitely recommend this watch!"
34,"Garmin DriveSmart 65, Built-In Voice-Controlled GPS Navigator with 6.95‚Äù High-Res Display",Electronics,"So far I have attempted to enter existing address from my Magellan GPS.  Out of four it says three can't be found, this is not a good start for transferring addresses.  What's wrong?  I thought today I would take the GPS out on a trial run, went to turn it on and it will not power up.  I think I will send it back.  How do I send this back. it will not turn on! I thought this would be a great replacement for having to use my phone while navigating a new area. However, yesterday we could not even use it to get us from one city to another let alone to an address. So very disappointed. It never acknowledges your voice on the first try.. Always have to repeat myself two, three, four times... It can be frustrating at times.. Sometimes I find myself having to yell and that doesn't work sometimes.... I am not a fan of Garmin but I could not find another Tom Tom like my old one.  This piece of junk, like my last Garmin has the wonderful feature of occasionally telling me that I cannot get to my destination without using a toll road.  Say what?  I got here without a toll, why can't I go back without a toll??  Literally, this unit and the last one (a gift from my wife) both told me I could not reach my destination without using a toll road on a few different occasions.  Absurd!  What kind of technology does that?  It totally defeats the purpose of using a GPS if it will not find a path without a toll road.  Does Garmin have a business relationship with the state DOT's to generate revenue? This does not pick the best routes, at least not in my area.  The GPS on my phone is far superior,  I purchased this for areas where I don't have phone service.  Those areas also don't have multiple road choices, so it does a  better job of not sending you on inconvenient and slower routes.  Overall, I'm disappointed with it.  The interface is not user friendly either. My reasoon for my purchase of this GPS was voice command,  This voice command does not respond to anythiing close to what I request.  As such I will be returning it to Amazon. Can‚Äôt program another route.  Would like to put in shortest distance but does not seem to be available .  At times gives incorrect directions .  Difficult to use even our son had a hard time figuring it out.  A waste of money and would not buy again. The Garmins were used or refurbished. I returned them."
35,"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts, Multipack",Computers,"You get what you pay for. Shirts already falling apart at the seams after only a couple wears & washes. The shirts are too short in the waist. Too short to tuck in your pants. I should return all of them. Shrunk after first wash but still wearable I feel that theses (XXL) are a touch small, but I feel that most Gildan products run a little small. It is almost fit perfectly, but length is tooooo long. Great price!Good Brand Name.Good quality tees for summer. Not too thick and are cool to wear on hot days.Liked so much, bought 4 more packs for backup purposes for next year.Just cant beat the price!!!!!! Shirt package was opened and missing 1 tee shirt. They fit very well easy to clean and don't fade when wash This is a terrific product. Very comfortable and excellent fit. Definitely a great value Cheap. Do not hold shape. Curl up at sleeves and bottom hem. wasn‚Äôt soft or fitted and basically ruined after one wash in the machine They fit well, comfortable, This shirt is just weird, neck is tight and seems off center. The fit is perfect, but the quality is not what I expected for a product with such good reviews. The fabric is thin, the collar gets bent easily.I don't know how durable they are, but I will be surprised if they last more than a season. I bought these to casually wear around the house, and they serve their purpose. My wife also used a few for crafting and said they work well. They came a little large, but overall a good product will be buying again when I need more Good. Great value for money.  I bought over sized, for comfort lounging.  Seems to hold up in wash. they do shrink, so keep that in mind when you order. Got screwed bought 12 shirts and dried them once and they shrunk atleast a full size or 2.If you are L buy XLIf you are XL buy XXL Was a little snug , nice and soft Son liked these t-shirts worth the price, however material is a bit thin. Not sure how they will look after washing. These fit well, but they come out of the dryer extremely wrinkled. Casual wear. What a quality find. Perfect fit! Be prepared...these shrink quite a bit after washing and drying. Liked the shirts fit as a large should a little loose like I like.After washing one shirt it had shrunk to about a tight medium. Shrink after wash. Fits well at first but shrunk pretty fast Well, I have no issues with the overall comfort of the tshirts, however the tshirts come in different sizes even though they all have the same size sticker on the back. Great tee's ! my son really them nice shirt They‚Äôre shirts in a pack, can‚Äôt go wrong The 4 star review attracted me to them Arrived quickly. Very rich feeling material. Nice necks. Good looking t-shirts Thin material Sleeves very short. I bought these in October of last year, so I've given them more than their fair share of tries. The neck feels like it's higher on my throat than it is on the back of my neck and the sleeves (although cut the same exact length as my other shirts) sit way too high up my arm.I finally threw them all in the donation basket today because every time I put one in, I take it back off and put on a shirt that fits properly. Washed them when received and every one shrank. These run a size smaller than you would usually order. I normally fit Large and it‚Äôs a good oversize or the right size but these fit a bit tight I had to stretch out but besides that I love them I will get do next time. Great quality Exactly what I was expecting to get Two shirts had small to medium white spots on them, bleach? At first the shirts fit perfectly, then after one wash they shrunk drastically. Very dissatisfied and will not buy these agin, too good to be true for the price. THEY WERE THINNER THAN I LIKE Washed once and the seams are coming undone do not buy this product poorly made I bought a pack of these a couple years ago and they were awesome. They succumbed to the dreaded antipersperant stains so I decided to buy them again.Waste of money. Thickness is about half of the old ones. They've pretty much completely redesigned these. They also fit my shoulders like they're made for a 12 year old. Guess they decided to cheap out and ride out the benefit of the older positive reviews. This is one of the reasons I don't shop as much on Amazon anymore. You cant win. I ordered these for a friend because they liked the ones I bought before. Those fit perfect but these were way off and not even close. Buyer BEWARE Also not the price of Russell.  Good lightweight t for summer wear.  Recommend hanging to dry to maintain color and shape. My son broke out in a rash. Maybe wash them first. But this has never happened with new shirts before. I have ordered 2 sizes M&L but had same problem with the tightness thru the shoulders and arms they are a great value just not a great fit for me I am 6'3"" 185lbs 70 plus years old and wish they fit better thanks for your time These are really good shirts, ESPECIALLY considering the price. They are the perfect thickness and are made of very durable material. You can use them as undershirts or wear them as t-shirts just as well. They aren‚Äôt as flattering as they look in the photos (or maybe I‚Äôm not as muscular as I believe I am) but all things considered these were definitely a great purchase. Super comfortable, I could wear these everyday. I do wish they were just a tad bit bigger. Surprisingly I washed them a couple times and one of them has a hole on the back below the neck. Definitely not Hanes. very cheap fabric Not worth the money. IMO they‚Äôre the same quality as Hanes, Fruit of the loom, etc. Thinner shirt with cheap/thin neck. For some reason I‚Äôve bought shirt with logos on them before that were Gildan and they were great....these however are cheaply made. perfect fit for big dudes Looser fit than expected for that size, good price and the fabric does not feel thin as other reviews have stated but it's also not premium fabric either. Extremely wrinkled and they do not look or fit like the picture shown on the website. One of the shirts was ripped. I usually wear a large but the large is more like a medium and much too small. Shirts run small The shirts were awesome till I put them to dry. Then they became size large from a 2x. Waste of money. I like these shirts but keep in mind they will shrink a little. These t-shirts are comfortable to wear and pretty well made but they shrink after one wash. Whatver your built, it might be best to buy one size up. TOO THIN & CHEESY 6/pack/Black/MThe black color is faded or dull, not a deep rich black. I commonly notice this with t shirts or undershirts. I dislike it, but, It's not enough to jeopardize my decision. It matches the Gildan boxer brief.The fit is okay. It was difficult knowing if they were considered undershirts or t shirts. Undershirts usually fit smaller and have smaller sleeves that I dislike. I consider this to be undershirts, however, versatile enough as a t shirt. So, I am satisfied.I can wear a S or M for most shirts. I chose M for these to avoid a possible return. Because I had a feeling they fit more of a undershirt. That was a good decision so far. I have not washed them, though. So, I can't comment about shrinkage. There is enough length to tuck into pants and not show stomach.  The sleeves are shorter than I like. However, getting a larger size for a chance of longer sleeves risks the overall size. So, I will cooperate.The neck is not favorable. But, I dislike crew necks. I prefer v neck, polo or button. Although there is a v neck available, lots of v neck undershirts have very deep ""v's"" exposing too much chest and the sleeves are short. So, I did not want to risk trying the v neck.So far I am satisfied. I have had better, but, these are good value. Bought these in 3xl for my dad. He's a big dude. The fit was okay but they are ridiculously short. He ended donating them. Thin material but comfy. Fits as expected but threads come loose after first wash. The shirt shrunk as soon as I wash them now they don‚Äôt even fit Lite and soft. Shrinks I've ordered these shirts a few times, and I love the look and feel of them. If you're looking for t-shirts that are comfortable, keep their shape and look good by themselves or serve as an undershirt, look no further.They are affordable, good quality and something that can be taken care of easily. Not preshrunk, order a size larger They run much larger than true size. 4/5 softShirts fit fine and are worth the little money. ok Fit's good and nice material:) They shrink terribly.  One wash and cannot wear them now. Overall nice shirts however I am not a hipster I prefer longer sleeves to cover the upper arm to look professional these are a little short for me Love the comfort and fit. Comfort and length The t shirts are really good and affordable. The cloth quality is fine. Bought it twice. Item received was 100% cotton. Okay the size runs two too short. Washed before trying on with warm water. Material is thinner then normal but okay for under a shirt. It seems to be short but again it is not ‚Äútrue to fit‚Äù. If you want a light T-shirt this is it. I ordered a X-large when I would usually wear a large...In this case an XX-Large would be more comfortable Good fit. Not too hot. Comfy Perfect for yet shirts came with dirt on them. Not sure if they had fallen on the floor during the packaging phase but there were black marks on each except one. These tee shirts are just horrible.  It‚Äôs my second purchase of this brand, same size and color.  My first purchase was spot on comfortable.  My recent order are tight fitting, especially the arm sleeves.  Almost like extra small sleeves were sewn on a medium size shirt.  This isn‚Äôt anything like the Gildan tees of the past. These shirts start out at 2x then when you wash them they fit like a women‚Äôs medium terrible shirts They fit fine feel good and great to sleep in Bought for my husband who normally wears XL in men‚Äôs.  These were extremely small, and as a woman that wears medium, they were only a little large on me.  So probably fits more like a large than XL. Size up! Runs small, very very thin. Stitches aren‚Äôt even.  Not the Gildan quality I‚Äôm used too. Not one shirt fits the same as the other.  Go to the store! Comfortable and fits just right. I'm glad I got a bunch of them. Nicely priced,  felt good Same old story as all the others. Basic t-shirt that shrinks a ton and has a saggy collar. Why doesn't someone make a pre-shrunk t-shirt with a collar that looks neat? The shirts are very nice, but damm Amazon listings. I typed in POCKET TEES, and thought these looked good, unfortunately they are not pocket tees.  My fault for thinking I was specific in my desires, fooled me.  The shirts are really great but Amazon cannot be trusted to show what you ask for. The shirts shrink about a size however I was eclectic this and bought them a size larger than I needed. After washing, they fit like a boys small. Keep in mind, I bought men‚Äôs large. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Waste of money for me. These shirts were too small with uncomfortable fabric. The medium gray we‚Äôre ok soft, but the black ones were very rough.I highly recommend you don‚Äôt buy these. buy NEXT LEVEL brand instead. Really like the quality of the fabric for its price. Will buy again My husband and my son both love these shirts.  Definitely buying more.  The fit and quality of these shirts are perfect. The first thing that I noticed was the thinness of the material so I held the fabric up to the window light along with a 5 yr old worn Jockey t shirt.  The older t shirt was twice as thick and the new ones from Gildan looked half the weight almost reminding me of cheesecloth. Great Shrinks significant amount after wash. Lightweight T-shirt Maybe I've gained weight, but these are pretty snug in the xl size.  Under armour and nike xl usually fit me well. My son-in-law loves these Tee's for work.  He's a construction contractor and works in ALL weather conditions.  The Tee shirts help with his body's sweat and perspiration control. Shrinks a lot after washing but fabric is very light and soft Ordered it for my boyfriend who needed it for work, and fits just perfect! Thanks Fits as expected and color match is spot on to that seen online. Just beware the shirts are on the thin side which makes them very breathable. brought these for my husband to work in for the summer. first wash and they started to shrink.  The color was great but they will shrink on you so order a size or 2 up if you want to get a seasons wear out of them. They are nice plan Jane tshirts that is good quality. Sleeves are too short Nice but the shirts were a little smaller than expected Of course, price is at times the best guide to buying items, but these T-shirts are a good buy. The softness is nice, but the fit is a bit snug. Perhaps they'll stretch with continued use. The color choice could be expanded for better personal selection. Came a little small. Should by a size bigger Way smaller than average clothing the same size. Comfortable undershirt It‚Äôs it true to size at all. Idk what those other reviews are on but the 5pack of navy, charcoal, red shirts is at least a full size too small and made of very thin material. Buy a size up these shrink a bit more than normal Material is horrendous. Better quality than F of TL and should equate to longer wear. Not super high quality but they are t shirts. All shrunk within a few months of normal washing so get 2 sizes bigger than you normally wear. Too big before washing and drying cycle Good shirts for a person working in a restaurant kitchen.  But, beware they shrink when washed/dried as they're 100% cotton.  I'm going to look for a poly/cotton blend. Material thin The material in these shirts are much thinner than the ones I previously purchased. They don't even fit the same. Quality has gone down."
36,"Goorin Bros. Men's Animal Farm Snap Back Trucker Hat, Black Horse, One Size",Computers,"Hat was nice but way too small. Could only fit my 6 year old daughter. I like the look and design, but the hat is way too small for my head, just as another reviewer stated. Yup, you read the title right, long head. While I like the hat, nice circumference fit since it's adjustable, it's a bit deep. It sort of rests uncomfortably on my ears with plenty of space on top. That's the only drawback; otherwise, it's all good. FAKE! Cute hat, but when worn, it bulges out a little on the sides. It's not b/c it didn't fit, but because it's just bulky with material. It looked too weird so I returned it. A little bit small, whoever designed this is kind a cock. Came mishaped in the box. im not sure if this is an original or not but either way for $35 i would expect to get a better quality and fitnot a great buy It's just far too large. IF you wear hat size 7 1/2 or larger, this hat is too small.  I usually wear a 7 1/2 or 7 3/4 depending on the hat.  This hat was a tight fit on the very last peg which I don't like wearing them that way anyways.  I returned it.  The quality was very nice, but its not for big heads. The hat is perfect, I love it! Said it would fit large heads-it did not üòû Bought for a friend.Ordered ""Buck Fever.""Paid the Price for ""Buck Fever.""WANTED ""Buck Fever""Got: ""Grizzly""Hmmm I love these hats however, the ""Bass"" blue cap coloring faded pretty quickly after purchase. I still love it though! I want the ""Beast"" Lion cap however, it's been out of stock for the longest. It's a fake productüò° I got a big head but trucker hats are normally one size fits all sucks it wont fit I honestly liked the hat but this is for kids. I am very disappointed as i am returning this product due to the fact that it wont fit.."" Yea right for one size fits all"" This is the second Goorin Bros hat I've purchased. This one's patch did no sit flat and has ripples which is quite disappointing. Still a good hat and of decent quality. husband liked the design but it was too small and looked silly on his head. Great hats but too small Hat come without its animal badge on it. I will need to return. Nice !!! Quality product tc, quality materials. This cap is not as the original. The headtop piece is much higher than the originale cougar cap, making this one more or less useless. I took of the cougar piece and sewed it on an other cap Nice ü§ó I love the subdued colors, and the embroidery is both quality and hilarious (it's a bear making a bear face labelled ""bear"" what's not to love), but even with the strap undone, it just doesn't fit my head! I don't wear hats usually, but for some perspective, I have a size 7 3/4 boonie hat that fits snugly. Others may not have this problem.The only other gripe I have is that the mesh can be very abrasive behind the ears, so you may need to either modify it or wear it high. I got it for the funny patch, but the hat itself is of poor quality. The brim is stitched in crooked and the hats 1 notch too tight or 1 notch too lose. It‚Äôs more of a $10 hat at best and would have rather bought the iron on patch to place on a better quality cap. Says one size fits most. If you have a head bigger than 7 1/2 cap size go ahead and pass on this. At 7 1/2 you‚Äôll only be able to use 2 snaps and that to me isn‚Äôt secure enough. I wear a size 7 5/8 and so do a lot of my friends and it does not fit at all. Unless i keep it on 1 snap which is ridiculous. Worst hat I‚Äôve bought this far. Probably the cheapest, crappiest made hat I have ever purchased (including trucker-style hats).  The quality and stitching was terrible.The patch, which was the whole reason I bought this, actually came off the hat easily and so I transferred and hand stitched it onto a $5.00 hat I bought from the dollar store that fits way better than this joke of a product. Will never buy this brand again. I have a lot of Goorin caps - but this one is smaller in the height as the others, making it a odd fit at least on my head. Too small. I bought 7 different hats and this one for whatever reason did not fit like the rest.  Such a shame. I loved the quality of them but this hat just doesn't fit like the rest. The cap looks better in pictures than in real life. It is too big and the materials are not top quality. The design in cool though. The shape is not like original or for damaged with shipping Would have preferred this be shipped in a box to protect the bill rather than an envelope. Well made Great cap had to take clean up long strings and threads left hanging . NICE"

I wanted a non skid bathroom rug. This product definitely is non skid. It is soft, but it is not plush as the company states.  I have not washed these rugs yet, so I did not comment on that category. The color of the mat I ordered (Emerald) is not the same color as the Emerald mat displayed in the pictures. The mat I received is quite a bit greener and brighter. I don't see a corresponding mat color on their store page, so I just have to assume their pictures are bad or the mat I got is somehow defective.I'm a little annoyed, because it's too bright and doesn't match my bathroom. Washed and dried perfectly the first few times.  About the 5th or 6th wash, the backing started to peel away and break off.  The item was washed per the directions.  Very disappointed. This bath mat is extremely slippery on the floor. Fell twice already in first 3 days of owning. There is absolutely no traction on the floor. Not great to step on with bare feet, very uncomfortable. Water gets trapped under the rug and is never absorbed nor dried. The color was exactly what I have been looking for. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a five star was because the smaller mats don‚Äôt ‚Äúgorilla stick‚Äù to floor like it says it does. The larger mats stay in place. Overall, I do like them. Okay, here's what you need to know: Yes, these rugs stay put and don't slip. But the little floofs are woven into the matting with little individual knots (I assume), so when you stand on it, what you feel on the bottoms of your feet is all those hard little knots.I don't know, maybe it's just me and my little princess feet or something. I actually bought these for my very old dog who has arthritis. He likes to lie about in the bathroom, but the old rugs would slip when he tried to get up. (Not good for an old dog with arthritis.) So I looked for something that would be both soft and stable for him. So yes, they are stable. And the material itself is... squishy. (I wouldn't characterize it as ""soft."") But I have to wonder if every time he plops himself down he doesn't think, ""Geez, this is lumpy."" Soft and absorbs but does not stick well to the floor. Pretty slippery Rubber backing disintegrated after 3 washes. I love how soft it is and the color is perfect. Rubber back peels away after couple washes The size is great. Feels nice when getting out of the shower Emerald doesn't match color at all. I was extremely disappointed that after only a few wash & dries - the back peeled off, and the rug lost its shape. Great Product. Looking forward to buy one more piece when it is on sale. Seems like I had one of these rugs a few years back and loved it.This rug (20x30) is great as far as being non-slip and absorbent. That said, I wish the density of the chenille columns was greater. They are far enough apart from each other that I constantly see the backing whether or not the rug is in use. It's not very cushy underfoot. Haven't washed it yet, so have nothing to report on that score.Not sending it back, but hoping maybe the mfr. will update the design to make the rug design more comfortable underfoot. I washed it once and the backing fell off - made a mess - I will not purchase them again Ugly duckling bath mats.  Maybe for a college dorm.  Not for nice bathroom. One gentle cycle cleaning and the backing completely disintegrated. And no response from seller. Rug shed a lot We ordered this towel because of the absorbency, washing machine safe, and gripper on the bottom. It was to help ensure the safety for my grandmother to get around in her bathroom. I really liked this bath mat - soft and safe. The rubber backing did an excellent job of preventing slips. And it washed well in a washer. However, after about 2 1/2 years of use, and being washed probably every week, I realized the back was shredding. A couple more washes and it fell apart completely. Not just one tear - the whole area of rubber was fragmenting. Washing was on the medium setting with cold water, typically with a bunch of towels. 80% of the time it was dried outside on a clothes line (in the CA sunshine). Other times it went through the clothes drier with other laundry. I suppose 2 1/2 years isn't too bad but I admit to being disappointed. A pity. The pile on the top of the mat is still fine, but now it skates dangerously around all over the bathroom floor and is thus useless.. I'll probably get another one but this time keep it out of the sunshine and maybe dry it indoors on a rack instead of the tumble dryer, and see it it lasts longer. No grip on this rug, nearly slipped getting out of the shower several times. I would not recommend. The color (Dk Brown) is exactly what I thought it would and should be. The rug is extremely soft and well made. It is not absorbent enough to soak up the water/mud from the dogs feet as quickly as they step on and off, which was probably unrealistic on my part. I would buy it again, just not for that purpose. Ditto to headline The appearance of the rug gives it a thick look when in actuality, it is thin.  The bottom of the rug moves as soon as it is stepped on.  This type of rug should not be used on a smooth surface such as tiles or wooden flooring.  It can be dangerous on those two surfaces. Gorilla grip more like gorilla slip, have fun falling on this mat every time you step on it Some of the shag parts are coming outNot as thick as my last ones I boughtI‚Äôm think my first set came from a different company Works great in front of my husband's shower.  The rug is soft and absorbent and the color is just right. I washed this in my washing machine and it wouldn't spin properly. So I had to let it drain in my washer and then move it to my shower to drip-dry it weighed a ton when I tell you. Not easy to clean if you do do not put it in your washer because you'll never get it out I thought the rug was thin  Felt like I was standing on floor with no rug. I purchased 2 other gorilla rugs and loved them Bottom liner for grip came apart. Still love the soft design. Might just add my own grip to the bottom. Use it and works great as a dog food mat! originally decided on purchasing this rug ... Due to the fact the name caught  my name you see im disabled (Club foot) so i definetly need something that will stay in place otherwise. I am risking hurting myself really bad... tooo make a long story short this rug ... if u can even call it a rug ... due to it being so small... Well in my honest opinion it should be called the banana peel Lol Sadly this rug looks better in the ad.  As soon as you walk on it, it flattens out. Not what I expected.  I have another brand that is very fluffy. I have had this bathmat for about a month and, so far, so good. It is soft and doesn't slip. I have washed it twice and it held up very well. There is an excellent choice of colors, and the price is very reasonable. The rugs snag easily and out of the 7 or 8 I've received not a single one of them is uniform on all 4 sides. In other words, they all look crooked visually when looking down. I used this for my bathroom. It gets the job done. I am happy. Doesn‚Äôt slip around. Absorbs water very well. It says it is gorilla grip but mine slides all the time. It does not grip the floor at all. Value for the money Easily is moved, doesn‚Äôt stick well to floor and stay out I have these rugs in all of my bathrooms. The colors are great. The last purchase was the royal blue and it was a beautiful shade of blue. They hold up pretty well after washing - you do not get a ton of lint in the dryer filter. I don't know if the gorilla grip backing is any more powerful than other backing. The cost is more than other rugs so I guess you pay for the name. I put in the washing machine n the whole bottom started to tear up. I was looking for puffy luxurious bathroom rug and nope you don't get that. It's really skinny and I even feel my concrete ground! It's winter and this rug not puffy or luxurious. I would of bought something much better at bed bath and beyond. Bought this rug for a tiled floor outside the tub. When I first place the rug down and stepped on it it was like I was on an ice-skating rink, rug slide all over the place. Would definitely not use outside a tub on a tiled floor!!!!!! Has no grip. When you step on its slides. I‚Äôve slipped many times. You will slip less if you didn‚Äôt have the mat. I wish I could return it. Great mat but after 3 washes, on delicate, the backing pulled off and ripped into pieces. i like this rug and fits nicely in my bathroom. It seems to hold in the water nicely. My only concern is that when stepping on it I did feel the water soaking in. but i would recommend the product bec it does hold the water and does not smell like mildew Not at a what is described.  Came rolled up now u can see the backing.  Won't let me submit a photo Looks fine but not particularly soft and definitely not plush. Exactly what I was looking for.  I messed up and ordered a size smaller than I wanted but the mat itself is very good quality and feels great under your feet. Highly absorbent and plush.  I haven't washed it yet, so we'll see how well it holds up when washed, but so far I love the product. Ordered three of these rugs on the glowing reviews and the product does not live up to reviews at all. Feels cheap and pile of the rug is not thick at all. Blurbs in product description use words like plushness and density. I would say these products are neither. Very disappointed. We bought a cheaper basic Target rug and it was much much nicer. Maybe they will last longer than other rugs but there is barely any cushion to it from day one. Don't waste your money. Not very soft or thick, moves all over my floor does not grip as described. Smaller than I anticipated though the measurements were listed.  It dies tend to more more than I would like and there have been moments where it prickly, like sharp fibers poke through.  Does the job though. Have used for 5 months now and it's surprising how uncomfortable a rug can be. It's not soft at all. I find myself standing on the tile because it is do tough on my feet. It's like standing on gravel. I will be shopping for new ones They look cheap. They feel cheap (not thick or cushy at all). Price was not-so-cheap. I returned them. I haven't used this product yet, so can evaluate it based on its effectiveness, but the color as portrayed on the Amazon site isn't accurate.  I need a deep burgundy rug.  This one looks right in the the Amazon picture, but is really much brighter maroon red. Doesn't work with deep burgundy accessories at all. Loved the color (bought Eggplant) and super soft.... Gorilla grip bottom tends to slide a bit on my tile bathroom floor but I still really like look/feel It works and it looks alright but its not something i would call plush or comfortable to walk on. But other than the color, I'm not impressed.It's not soft or floofy like I was expecting. It feels like an old towel, nowhere near ""extra soft"", and very thin.I guess it's absorbent, and it doesn't slip out from under you.But, it does ""walk"". As you stand or walk across it, it inches itself across the room. Very annoying.The best I can say is it keeps the water off the floor when you step out of the shower.I would not buy again. Matt‚Äôs were a little thin.Seem absorbent.Mostly cotton so cleans easily. I fell when I stepped out of the shower grip is no good had to put a towel underneath it. Not full at all, making it not very soft. You can find better. I really like this mat however if it gets even remotely wet on the floor it will not grip! Frustrating as that often happens in a bathroom especially with kids. After reading many reviews that said this bathmat did not stay put, I was hesitant to buy it but I'm glad I did.It is plushy and absorbent.  The instructions state that if there is ANY moisture on the back after washing and drying it, it will slip -- but that this can be avoided by giving it more drying time.  I haven't washed it yet, so if this turns out to be untrue I will update the review. Does not grip to the floor AT ALL. Very thin. Our new Bathroom rug  when stepping on it with bare feet feels different,  kinda  rough otherwise  it is as advertised . I purchased this after seeing it listed under ""best bath mats"" and reading the reviews. I can't speak to absorbency as we put it down, stood on it, and promptly decided to return it. The fibers are soft which is nice but it is so thin it feels like you're standing on nothing. If you're looking for something just to dry, this may work. If you want it to feel luxurious and to keep your feet from hurting if you're not wearing shoes (as we don't in the bathroom), don't get this. I really wanted to like it. I don't. There is absolutely no grip. Rug slides all over the place. Learned an expensive lesson the hard way.  I bought 4 of these in brown. Loved them!  Very plush and absorbent.  Unfortunately, the very first time I washed them, I was in a hurry to get my laundry done and, not thinking, put them on ""Rapid Dry.""  Oh, brother!  I've been kicking myself ever since!  The entire backing fell apart into pieces!  I literally have to wash them by themselves now, so I can collect up all the pieces that come off every time I wash them, even in ""Delicate.""  My bad . . . just a warning. Don't do what I did. Now I have to buy another 4.  Not cheap!  My fault totally.  Live and learn.. Even though it has a rubber backing there rug shifts on the floor. It's kind of scary when your foot catches in the rug that's not in there floor. Needs to be straightened multiple times a day. Get two smaller rugs instead. Nice, small sized rug bought for an apartment bathroom. Very comfortable I was expecting it to be softer on the feet like a different set (brand) I purchased earlier. Otherwise, it performs as expected. Super soft, but it is not Gorilla Grip. It slips if the floor is wet. Ask me how I know. Very soft, does not move or slide, the color adds brightness to the room. It appears to be excellent quality. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs absorbent or easy to clean since it was not very soft.  Sent it back. Does not grip my tile floor very well, it slips slightly almost every time i step out of the shower. The fabric is very thin and soaks very easily. The rubber layer is also thin, I haven't tried washing it yet but does not seem like it will survive very many washes. I love the way these rugs look, and the rubber backing keeps them in place on my floor. I only wish they were thicker. takes too long to dry. good color Love these rugs!  They are very absorbent and soft.  Light weight, not bulky.  Also they do not slip!  They wash nicely as well.  I am very pleased with my purchase. this product slipped on the floor even when dry  will put on porch for cat to lay  not worth my time to return Was not the quality that I expected. For a room without a lot of traffic it would be ok. Works grest Ok.  So I gave this a good ole college try.  But, no matter what I do, this rug causes us to slip.  I bought it for a high traffic bathroom, my master (2 people), and we about killed ourselves stepping on it from the shower.  Then I tried it in a low traffic bathroom (guest) and my kid took one bath (not even a shower with the spray) and he fell  I'm not sure what the deal is.  It is super soft, but I would NOT recommend this at all. So far, so good. Color is as described. Super soft and perfect for space. It keeps moving It's a bath mat that doesn't absorb water.  You can move the mat 24 hours after you get out of the shower and the area under it is STILL WET!! Kind of defeats the whole purpose of a BATH MAT!!!!!!! NOT comfortable!!!!  Cheap!  Never used! No slippage , color great, feels great on bare feet .. great product They are soft and absorbent, but they slide. I adjust them 7,000 times a day. If you‚Äôre looking for a non slip rug, this is NOT it. Definitely not worth the money. Looks cheap, is ugly, and very thin, no padding to it. I love these bath mats as they look great, dry fast and wash perfectly. Came apart after washing. I NEED to be able to wash my bath mats. And since I have a toddler, i need it to be more absorbent than it is. Does not grip on floor Absorbent and dries quickly The bad: The color was supposed to be beige, but looks like grey mud. The surface of the rug is soft, but it offers minimal cushioning. The rug flattens after you stand on it. The good: It doesn't slide and it washes okay. It slides easily.  The name would imply otherwise, but it slides on our tile. Terrible! Super, super thin. Huge disappointment. The best for dogs and kids bar none. Great rugs at a great price! Fun color and great value These rugs are thick and a great foot comfort This rug is soft and the colors have never faded, even after washing. The problem is that it absorbs so well that it doesn‚Äôt dry out all the way and now smells musty, even after washing. I have this rug right outside the shower. I won‚Äôt purchase this again. The color and size were nice but the tufts were spaced so widely that you could see the backing. The backing of the rug is extremely slippery on a wet floor. One of the kids left some water on the floor that got under the rug. I walked in bathroom and went down on my but like walking on ice. I love my pink bathroom rugs. They are so soft and absorbent. These are exactly what the seller described. They are beautiful. Excellent quality. Highly recommend. Remember, you only get what you pay for. The rugs stay in place and do not slide, which is what we were looking for! The absorbency and quality are great! looks good, works just Fine This bath mat is a much different shade than pictured, it‚Äôs much more neon blue-green and cheap looking than the muted neutral tones in the image.Material feels weird and cheap beneath your feet, overall just much worse than a comparably priced product from something like Trgt Threshold series (which I replaced it with within a day of receiving this one).Would not recommend even if you like the color The color is great and they feel good on your feet. I boughtone in purple and one in teal. They stay put. Absorbency is good and is easy to clean. Not as soft as we thought but not too bad. Does not slide on tiles! Good value Doesn't stay in place and isn't very thick Great! Soft and absorbs perfect I like these mats just fine, but I‚Äôm not 100% impressed. They are OK. The mat around the toilet is smaller than I‚Äôd like. Also, the prices were a tad steep. I like this rug, BUT...... it does not stay snug on my tile floor.  This rug slides all over my floor without being a slip hazard.  It doesn‚Äôt slide when I step out of the shower.  The rug just doesn‚Äôt stay where I put it.  I am constantly adjusting it back to where I want it. exactly what I wanted.. a soft, durable and SECURE bathroom rug mat.  getting out the shower barefoot, this mat feels great under my feet.  Very soft, highly absorbing and it doesn't budge.  Been using it for 3 weeks showering daily and it hasnt moved an inch.  it absorbs every drop of water that hits it while I towel off.  couldn't ask for anything more.  for the price, this is a great bathroom rug mat.  buy it, you wont be disappointed. Size and color was most important Will not stick to my tile floor moves all over the place The quality of this mat is not what I expected.  Light weight, backing does not hold to the floor well. Very nice composition of fabric with nice rubber backing Pretty soft and worked well for a college apartment. Would be a little difficult to clean and did not do the best job absorbing. The item was too expensive! The size was not worth the price! Could got the same item for $10 less at Family Dollar! Don‚Äôt waste your time or money! The bath rug is extremely soft, very absorbent and dries quickly. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the rug does slip a bit. Not badly, but enough to be cautious when elderly of less steady people are using it. I would buy this again. But, if more than 10$ I would just spend more and buy better. The puffs that are sticking out are minimal, so there is less soft material under your feet. They need to be more dense.  tTese are just enough for one bathroom sink vanity.When they arrive they are bent out of shape, but that settles and fixes over a few days. Warmer temps or heated floors will help this. Was happy until backing shredded after only second time washing. Bought 2. Both Arrived with the band around the edges detaching from the rest of the rug. Absorbs well toss in washing machine These mats slide more than the Jamaican Bobsled team. They are cute but useless for grip.  Wish I could give 1/2 star. Very thin, no Cush! I‚Äôve bought cheap bath rugs from target for years and they always tore or lost it‚Äôs shape or color and the bottom would tear (I don‚Äôt put these in the dryer) but first impression of this bath mat is ADORABLE! The light pink perfectly matched a toilet lid cover I got from another seller, the rug is so soft, and when I got out of the shower you didn‚Äôt see a wet spot and it didn‚Äôt feel soaked like it usually is. It comes in several sizes, and I ordered two rugs that fit perfectly in front of my shower and I‚Äôm front of my sink/counter. My bathroom is cute and these rugs seem like they would be long lasting. I‚Äôm so excited to have these for a long time! Bought two .  I don't recommend . Has feeble grip on tile . Not comfortable on bare feet . Terrible quality. It looks like I‚Äôve had it for 10 years after only some uses. it is not soft the fabric is knobby not fluffy.  very disappointed After 4-5 washes, gentle cycle, the backing is split in multiple areas!  Poor quality. The only thing i really like about this rug is the color. It is not as plush as it appears, definitely not ""extra soft."" If water escapes your shower as it sometimes does, the rug is slippery on a wet floor. I feel like this is a rug I could have gotten at a dollar store for maybe 10 bucks. For our bathroom.  So far holding up.  Curious when it gets washed. Very ABSORBENT, gets dirty quick and its hard to vacuum..great rug dont suggest the black one like I got..stays crumby.."
38,"HP Chromebook 14-inch FHD Laptop, Intel Celeron N4000, 4 GB RAM, 32 GB eMMC, Chrome (14a-na0050nr, Mineral Silver)",Computers,"The computer arrived THREE DAYS before it was scheduled! That was a great help, as it meant that my computer could be synced with my school's computer network, before school started. I'm still working on understanding the capabilities and limitations of Chromebook, but so far I like it. I WANTED TO DO ONLINE WORK AND IT HAS GREAT SWIDE SCREEN AND KEYPAD Not enough storage Chrome OS doesn‚Äôt work for many software apps etc.  could not connect to many programs. Going back to a PC. Probably works for kids but not for ‚Äúgrown up ‚Äú who needs more than YouTube or social media. Highest quality at a very reasonable price.  This Chromebook does it all and the support is a pleasure to use. It's worth the price and it performs like a regular computer. Google helps a lot so that you don't have to wish you had Window's OS. I purchased July 2020, worked fine but now it wont turn on. It's been charging overnignt and still wont turn on. Good laptop for the money. Need a easy to use economical laptop. Still getting used to the operating system but the computer itself works well I bought this for my 15 year old she does remote high school because of the pandemic and her old laptop broke  I‚Äôll admit was a little nervous with all the bad reviews but I love this hell might buy myself one too & I didn‚Äôt have no connectivity problems at all connected to my WiFi & was running beautifully üòäüòäüòä Dislike the entire process of trying to delete information from recent files .. Diesnt reaky give u the option to delete what u want it's like its stuck there forever or maybe I just dont know what I'mdoing great for the price.  Works well. We needed another laptop for the house for everyone to use in the family room. Once we got used to it compared to the windows system we just love it. You open it and it starts, does not need to warm up, does not need a pass scree if you do not want it. My new Chromebook is great for keeping up with all email accounts, social media and the latest Youtube videos. Never seen an HP like this! Screen contrast and saturation changes with angle. It doesn't support Google Play games. Cells to Singularity and Raid won't run. The thumb pad rattles when you tap it. I had to power-wash it 1 day after unboxing. The only good thing about it is the power jack is kinda cool. I got this to replace a 6-year old Acer, which works better and is more stable. Stay away from this piece. The keyboard was white and I found it hard to see the letters Easy to use My girlfriends loves it. It's more louder than her old one . No dislike love it and worth it I like touch screen The pointer keeps disappearing and there was a bad virus hidden in the core which fried everything, so I took it to a tech shop and it cost me $$$ to fix it. They had to replace everything.  It works great now. Needed a new laptop for work. Nothing insane, just something that I could simply use to download/upload zip files and photos and most of my web-based work. This does exactly that. I'm not a techy person, just a regular mom who needed a laptop. Its very easy to use, no issues connecting and very light - I throw it in my purse. Its great. Bought 3 of these for my young grandkids for distant learning during the 2020 pandemic. No problem. we've been very satisfied. as described Wonderful little chromebook. Comes with excel and word. Does the job. Bought it when on sale, pretty happy about its white keyboard and touch screen function. Not happy about its fan sound, I cannot use it in the same room when my new born is at sleep. In addition, it got a little stuck when loading game to play. Overall give the price I paid, I would give it 3 stars. Works well.  Haven't quite mastered the back-lit keyboard settings yet - seem to have it in a ""manual on-off"" mode at the moment, where it originally was set to automatically turn on when tapping the keyboard.  Other than that, no issues and fast enough for video/web-based multimedia. This has to be the best computer buy of the century.  It has everything you would expect to find on a much more expensive model.  There is not one thing I would change about this little HP Chrome laptop.  It is perfect in every way possible. I wish I could give this 0 stars. Whether you prefer pc or mac go for any other computer besides a chromebook. The screen malfunctioned and so I restarted and the computer deleted all my local files, which on a chromebook includes EVERY file not saved to the drive. Even things from weeks or months ago that had been saved to your device. This computer is terrible save yourself the trouble. Son like it very much Avoid this product to prevent frustration A piece of trash! Was working on it and suddenly it just died! I just bought in April. ITS JULY 8th! Shouldve just rented it. It would have been worth a rented value. So pissed. How does something BRAND NEW JUST DIE???? Dont waste your money! Everything I love it. Touchscreen and a backlit keyboard for a great price. I had major issues with a third party seller (they sent me the wrong model number twice!), so stick with ‚ÄúSold by Amazon.‚Äù DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! We purchased this item for our daughter to use for virtual school. It worked for three days then randomly shut down/lost charge. Then would not charge no matter what we tried. We worked with HP support to try every option to fix. Nothing worked. The only resolution was to to ship it to HP for repair and this process would take a week at minimum if you paid a fee, longer for no charge. No thank you! We returned the item and went with a completely different manufacturer! So frustrating üòû No touchscreen and to heavy. Good product for the price.  Former IS geek and the installation process is lacking. Great item for the price! Easy to use, looks sharp in white, and has a good battery life. This product advertise as a Touchscreen which it is not. Also bad connectivity issues. Imagine my kids getting this on Christmas morning.  Total dissapointment Needed something quick. Did a little research and loved the reviews of this one. It‚Äôs great quality across the board. I use it for work and play. The battery life is amazing! I love this thing! It works great This Chromebook has been such a help to my child during Covid with online learning. It has worked out great this far. Plastic plastic I dislike setting up new units but this one was fairly easy to do.  I am elderly and easily confused by electronics but managed this one ok.  I have not set up anything out of the ordinary so can only say I like it for what I do. Some applications stink. Microsoft word isn‚Äôt the same program as on regular laptop.It‚Äôs basically an iPad as a computer but not Apple The product was damaged Love love LOVE my laptop! Price was great! Touch Screen is awesome, and colors on screen incredible ! Highly recommended !! Love itüíï"
39,Hair Catcher Durable Silicone Hair Stopper Shower Drain Covers Easy to Install and Clean Suit for Bathroom Bathtub and Kitchen 5 Pack,Home and Kitchen,"Had no idea my hair shed so much.  While such isn‚Äôt the best it certainly catches all the hair.  I leave on the side of the shower and move over the drain only when showering.  Easy to place and easy to remove.  I‚Äôd give it a total thumbs up on efficiency. These hair stoppers are appropriate for a traditional shower drain but not so effective on a combination bathtub/shower drain.  There is no suction.  I trimmed off some of the underneath plastic ""teeth"" on one of these so it would lay flat over the bathtub shower drain. Well made good value The size is good, many come in the pack, but my hairs still go through the drain. Useless, can't use in sinks and tubs with built in stoppers. In shower it slides off the drain. The nubby side which is supposed to face up is uncomfortable on the feet Easy to clean and install. Does the job I really needed a hair catcher for my shower as it kept getting clogged. These are ok, there are better hair catchers out there. This one wont stay over the drain, and if we put it over the drain it causes the water to start filling the tub up enough until it gets over the ""teeth"" that catch the hair. No real suction to the tub. The good thing is they send you a pack of 4 so you can choose which color you want. Although the product just lay over the drain and might slide around a bit, it does its job by catching the hair. Colors and aesthetics but not the bets drainage. Water pools and hair gets through the strainer, however it does catch some hair.  Would not recommend. Sage for dentures when dropped while cleaning. Catches the hair in shower.  Can throw these in washing machine with bleach load to clean and they hold up pretty well. It doesn‚Äôt stay in place very well but if you don‚Äôt accidentally touch it it‚Äôs ok. It cleans up easier than my last style. I love how easy it is to use in my standing shower. I also love that I can just throw away all the hair trapped in it & wash it in the sink or dishwasher. There is no suction. It usually stays in place, but there is nothing to suction it to the floor. Doesn't like to stay in place but grips hair so well, it's hard to clean. The silicone isn‚Äôt ‚Äústicky‚Äù which is a bad thing. It doesn‚Äôt stay in place at all and moves when something touches it. I‚Äôll be returning. USELESS. I purchased this product to catch hair from going down the drain. It catches none at all since the holes are too big. It does the work, initially it kind of moved around but then it just got stuck where it is supposed to, I guess it needed to shape a little bit. It doesn‚Äôt suction, but it functions fine. I like the colors! This does catch hair, however it is under the stopper. The stopper restricts water flowing down the drain and we get backup in the shower. Also, the bottom of the stopper gets moldy quickly. Easier to just use a snake to unclog the drain. Using this for a small shower in our extra bathroom. So far, so good That are way too big to use in sink not very good in shower to thick I wasn‚Äôt sure it would stay put against the flow of water but it did stay in place.  Some of the hair got through, but most seemed to catch. The size was great, and I like the color choices They honestly don‚Äôt seem to do anything besides get in the way of the water draining Slows down water drainage I didn't like that if I touched it then it would move They move around a lot Great hair catcher. Water still passes through easily with hair being caught on the stopper. Have not needed to unclog my drain since I started using it. What section power? Easy to install and catches smallest of the hair effectively Not worth the advertisement,,,!!! This item was very easy to use and easy to clean.  However, it does not seem to be catching too much hair.  Not for me. I think it catches some hair, but the design reduces drainage. So now the shower floor is dirty with soap scum instead of hair. Product needs improvement. Did not fit over my tub plug but works for shower and sinks The item doesn't stay in place when the water is on & doesn't keep the hair from going down the drain. Not impressed with this product!! I put one of these in the drain in my shower since I have long hair I had hoped this would help, it doesn't catch any hair and isn't helping at all. Very disappointing. I have short hair which escapes thru the holes. I need something like a screen. Just installed and looks pretty good so far. Affordable, nice colors, and catches hair! Does not stay because of lacking suction power; hold or slow the water during the shower. üëç Liked the product I was skeptical that this would work but I am pleasantly surprised.  I have long hair and my shower drain is always getting backed up.  These little discs work magic.  I've been using over six months now and haven't had a clogged drain since.  Remove the hair after every hair washing and see all the hair it captures from NOT going down your drain.  Great! It's a hair catcher that works. Easily clean. After using two different ones, I watched my hair go down the drains.. they collect mold on the bottom and don't truly suction. I've thrown them away & will not be purchasing more. good value I absolutely love these! I hated the other metal ones we used to have or the ones that went super deep and we‚Äôre disgusting to clean. These are super easy to clean and look great in your bathtub too. Doesn‚Äôt capture hair These slide all over the tub and don‚Äôt stay over the drain. They don‚Äôt catch anything I wanted to utilize this as a hair stopper. it does not stay in place, constantly moves around, and allows hair to go down the drain. This item is very pretty, it is not as easy to clean as I thought it would be. Haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it‚Äôs very attractive and colors are great. Looks like it‚Äôll do the job! These are useless, get the tub shroom. This hair stopper catches some hair but doesn't stay in place therefore hair still makes it into the drain which is a problem with a household of girls with lots of thick hair. The hair catcher works well. It does catch the hair but it doesn‚Äôt stay at a place. No suction at all. And it doesn‚Äôt work in a stand-in shower at all. Water cannot go through the thick edges. It floats around in the sink. The hair catchers look good, and seem like they should work, but do absolutely nothing. The rubber is too slick, the studs too big, and the gaps between them too wide, so hair slides right past. I've had one in my shower for weeks and there's not a single hair caught. Don't waste your time or money. These do a great job of catching the hair but they are a little difficult to clean. They also work best on a flat drain (as in a walk in shower) vs a tub drain. Great fit and staying power. Easy to clean. Does miss a bit, but still worth it. Not too prickly if accidentally stood on. This does the job for me. All I needed was something to catch the hair from going down the drain but in order to get it to work I had to unscrew the tub stopper which was fine for me. It doesn‚Äôt suction to the tub but it doesn‚Äôt float away either. Overall, it does the job which is all I cared about. Would not recommend.  Hair is extremely hard to get out of it!  Just lays on the drain ‚Ä¶ does not suction. Super easy to use!  We use these in all of our showers and they work great to keep the hair out of the drain. it doesn‚Äôt drain the water that well when it‚Äôs in use, but it does catch all the hair"
40,"Hard As Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream with Coconut Scent Nail Strengthener, Nail Growth & Conditioning Cuticle Cream Stops Splits, Chips, Cracks & Strengthens Nails, 1 oz",Beauty and Personal Care,"Noticed a difference after a few weeks. Five star product. This was recommended by a friend  to me. The smell is wonderful but not over powering. It goes on amazingly without any greasy residue I used this product to help strengthen my nails.  It did nothing and was a waste of time and money.  I do not recommend this product. I did take time to read the reviews before purchase. My nails have not seemed to get stronger. Although it does smell good and it does moisturize . Strengthen my nails To soften up my cuticles and strengthen my nails I‚Äôve used this cream approx 5 X per day for 3 weeks or so. It works wonders! It did nothing for my nails. Did not do anything for me. Disappointed but maybe it would work for others. I really like this product! I keep tubs everywhere - in at least two bags/purses, at my bedside, in the kitchen - all over. I started using it because I use Color Street nail strips. It's the only way I can manage to do my nails, but I feel like the strips damage my nail a little. (Not all Color Street users experience this.) I use the Hard as Hoof to moisturize my cuticles. I usually apply once or twice a day, more often in the winter and more often when I've removed the strips and want to work on healing my nails. I love the coconut oil base, it's easy to apply, and it's a product I trust. I really do not see a difference Has fast growth but nails are not as strong as I want them to be. Makes ur hands and Fingers feel like butter. Great scent, no greasy feeling! Love this product It‚Äôs ok. Been using for two months now and my nails are same. It is more than one and half a month I am using this product.. unfortunately I didn't recognize any changes to my nails Easy to use and it really works.  Despite taking biotin daily and other vitamins, my nails were thin and brittle for the first time in my life.  Since starting to use Hard as Hoof my nails are getting stronger and healthier. Seems to help my nails quite a bit!!! I would definitely recommend trying it if your nails are weak / brittle Love the scent and feel. Not oily but dies it‚Äôs job. Nails are stronger. A nice size jar. I have used Barielle Nail Cream for years and I thought I'd try this. I have used the whole jar and cannot tell one bit of difference. My nails are in pretty good shape, and when using Barielle Cream I see improvement after only a week. I've used this cream for at least 3 months and there is no change whatsoever. It's back to Barielle for me. My nails used to constantly break. After using this my nails grow and don‚Äôt break Just received so I dont know how well it works yet. There is a STRONG coconut scent so be aware if you are scent sensitive. This product works!  My nails are soft and split easily, this product makes my nails hard!  It smells great too! I bought this product after dip powder destroyed my nails. They were essentially paper. I had my nails painted with normal polish and used this daily, usually twice a day, and didn‚Äôt notice much improvement after 2-3 weeks. I took the polish off and have noticed more of a different in the last week, so I would suggest not wearing polish for this to work better. Can't stand the smell!! I really like the scent it smells like coconut. It does a good job at making your nails grow quickly. BUT, It doesn‚Äôt make your nails strong. My nails grew quickly in just a week but they are weak. I had to put a nail protector polish on them. If I didn‚Äôt they would break. It cream didn‚Äôt provide any strength to my nails. I put it on twice a day morning and night. But, I wash my hands a lot also. I‚Äôve used other nail growth creams and it didn‚Äôt matter that I washed my hands a lot. I‚Äôm a nurse so I‚Äôm constantly washing my hands and using hand sanitizer. I will used this jar up but I won‚Äôt buy it again. I just prefer to take biotin it helps my hair and nails grow. Now when I started taking the biotin with the nail cream my nails became stronger and grew faster. But, that‚Äôs a combination of both and not just the cream. So, that being said I would waste my money on the cream. It does moisturize your nails and soften your cuticles but that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs made for specifically. Save your money and buy some biotin vitamins or hair and nail vitamins and call it a day. Or try it and see if it works better for you??? But, I‚Äôd advise you not to wash your hands a lot after you apply it. So just applying it before bedtime would work but it may take longer to work and like I said it doesn‚Äôt strengthen your nails at first when they are growing. You have to be careful not to break them before they get long enough to begin to strengthen. Mine always broke before they got to the strengthening part. It‚Äôs conveniently packaged so I can easily carry with me.  I‚Äôve been applying it everyday and have seen absolutely 0 results.  My nails are still peeling and breaking. I noticed no difference in my nails after the use and not something I will purchase again. I have been using this since I received it and it hasn't worked yet :( I have been using it for a couple of weeks. So far I haven‚Äôt seen any improvement. This is a nice moisturizing nail hardening product.  Seemed to help with dry cuticles and hardening of my nails. I had thin, weak , peeling nails.  This stuff really worked to strengthen them. I really wanted to love this product. After 29 years of acrylics and gel nails, I wanted to believe this would work. Sadly, it made my nails soft. They started to grow but they bent and split. I feel like the cream does moisturize the nails, but you can do the same thing with cuticle oil. I take hair, skin and nail supplements. Honestly, they work better than this does. The cream is thick and creamy, it smells wonderful, like coconut. It just didn't work for me. I am not seeing the benefit even using product as directed. My nails are thin and brittle. Was excited to try this. Sadly,  did nothing. Unlike many, I did like the scent though. My nails were weak, peeling and slow growing. I started taking biotin, which helped, but wasn‚Äôt working as well as I‚Äôd like so I searched for something I could apply directly to my nails. Hard as Hoofs had good reviews so I ordered some. It smells yummy and no kidding, after using it 2-3 times daily, within a couple of days I could see a difference. Been using a few weeks now and my nails are much stronger. They have stopped peeling,  don‚Äôt bend and break easily anymore, plus they‚Äôre growing again. I highly recommend this product! I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in this stuff, but my nails are stronger, and they‚Äôre growing‚ÄîFAST. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the massaging of the cuticles when I apply the product, or the actual application of the product itself‚Ä¶or both. Either way, I‚Äôm seeing amazing results. Yep, it‚Äôs worth a try! This is not the same one you‚Äôd buy at the stores the consistency is sticky and gross. It‚Äôs not oily or even near the smell of the correct product. I purchased this based on all of the great reviews.  I tried very hard to like this stuff, because it does moisturize your cuticles and surrounding skin much better than any of my other lotions do, but the sickeningly strong odor of fake coconuts is nauseating, and I'm being kind here.  Once you put this stuff around your nails, you CANNOT get the smell off.  I have washed my hands, scrubbed my hands, I've done everything, and I can still smell this stuff.  Honestly, it's nauseating.  The cream itself comes off, but the odor remains.  For hours.  I wash my hands, pick up something to eat, and as soon as my hand gets to my mouth, I smell that fake coconut odor and my stomach lurches.  So if you have absolutely no sense of smell, then this would be a great moisturizer for your cuticles.  Otherwise, I would recommend searching for one that doesn't have an obviously strong odor to it, or one that at least can be washed off.  Hate it. I have been using this product for about 1 week. So far, my nails have been strong. The aroma of product is strong and smells like the suntan lotion that I use. It‚Äôs not a bad smell. The smell makes you feel like you‚Äôre on vacation! Product is working, so far. Been using for two weeks and I actually think my cuticles are drier than before I started with it.  Scent is bad too. Save your money. I‚Äôve been using this product on bare nails for above 3 weeks.  My nails LOOK much more healthy and are lo longer peeling and splitting but they still seem weak.  I generally wear polish all the time but I thought I would give this product time to take hold.  Still waiting for it to strengthen the nails.  They still break but I haven‚Äôt given up yet.  I try to use it at least 3x daily.  Will update it progress continues. Didn't notice a difference. Nails still brittle. Product was not effective.  Used the entire jar as directed.  No visible difference in nail quality.  Nails are still tattered and without any visible positive change after using this product.  I have the empty jar Awesome product! I'm constantly doing my nails at home and changing the color. I use gel polish, dip powder, and poly gels only. It can be a pain to remove any of them. When I'm being impatient, I sometimes buff the color off instead of soaking. Occasionally I go to crazy and over due leaving me with weak, thin nails.  I ordered this product.  Took off my polish and gave it a shot. I've been walking around with naked nails for 3 days and have used this product on them for all 3 days only applying it once before bed. My nails already feel stronger and a little thicker. My cuticles look great. The only bad thing I can say is that it doesn't do much to moisturize the whole hand. Also, my husband hates the smell of cocoa butter so avoid this if you don't like it. Overall I would recommend it. Have been using for few weeks and feel no difference in the moisture or strength of my nails. Not worth the money. I don't know what kind of hoofs they're referring to but this doesn't harden my nails like anything, let alone a hoof.It has a nice fragrance and is very thick and rich so I'm using it but there is no difference to my nails. At all. This product caused my nails to literally start tearing off at the tips it had the opposite effect it was supposed to and now my nails are burning. I‚Äôm not sure if mine was defective but I can‚Äôt recommend this despite the good reviews. This isn‚Äôt helping Love the change in my cuticles on my hands and even my toes. They are less dry and I tend to pick or need to trim ragged skin less.  This is my second jar. First jar lasted a long time. I don‚Äôt know if this stuff works because it smells so strong, I refuse to use it any longer. My husband hates the smell also, he can smell it instantly when I walk into a room even though it‚Äôs been an hour since over put it on. Also fragrance can be toxic, why include it in the first place. Unnecessary and I‚Äôm disappointed. I tried this for a 4 weeks and honestly I think it made my cuticles really dry. I have extremely dry skin and always have and this doesn‚Äôt help at all. I gave it away to see if someone else would like it but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone who has very dry skin and cuticles. It didn‚Äôt help my nails get any harder or grow either. Best product even over nail polish! Repaired my splitting nails!  Love this!! When I opened the jar and smelled the cream I thought it smelled wonderful. I gently rubbed the cream onto each nail and then a couple of minutes later I got a huge headache, dizzy, and felt sick to my stomach. I washed my hands and within about 10 minutes I felt fine. So this product may help your nails grow harder but it's not for me. I've been using this product for 4 months now.  I rub it on my cuticles and nails twice a day, and while it moisturizes my cuticles, so they aren't as dry and jagged, they are still peeling in the corners, and it's done absolutely Nothing to strengthen my nails...they are still peeling and breaking! Granted, I have terrible nails and not even nail hardeners/strengtheners help them grow, I thought this would help, because of its good ratings, and has coconut oil in it, which smells strongly of coconut, so be aware if you don't like that smell, because you won't like this.  I am disappointed. Love this product. I‚Äôve been using it for several months with great results. My nails feel so much better and are getting stronger. My natural nails are finally past my tips some. The smell is nice of a light coconut.  I‚Äôll purchase again. I guess it's moisturizing..I only used it once for about 10 minutes ..IT STINKS..very strong smelling..not vanilla , not coconut , was it bad past expiration not sure could not place smell..on to next thing.. Not super moisturizing or greasy like some nail creams, and absorbs quickly when applied. But I did notice an improvement in my nails (which aren‚Äôt great) after even one or two uses. Seems to strengthen well. I usually never review products, but with this one, I had to!It really works. I used to have to use nail polish to keep my nails thick and not breaking, but everytime I removed the polish they were even more damaged!I've had this product for about 3 months and my nails have never been so thick and long! It took about a month to notice, but now it is undeniable. I don't need polish anymore, unless I just want color, but my nails are strong and beautiful! And going from acrylic to natural nail I saw my nails deteriorate after to weeks of this cream I lost patience with it. Smells great, but this did the opposite my nails became weak :( If you use it as recommended it will work! The only issue I had was that it didn't come with instructions, I had to google it. Package arrived ripped open and somewhat taped back together, and the product was cracked and damaged. Post office marked package as having received it damaged. I‚Äôm extremely unsatisfied and bothered that such little care was put into the shipping of the product, am returning. Ok so I tried the whole container of this stuff and it didn't really work. It didn't make my nails more strong or make them grow faster. They did help my cuticles stay very hydrated and not cracked which was nice but kind of besides the point. Don't think I'd purchase this again but that's just my personal opinion. For me personally I just take Biotin and iron and they have helped my nails massively. Awesome scent. Very moisturizing if a little oily... but great. Have notice a difference, not much but thats because I don't use it as often as instructed. Overall satisfied:] I saw no difference in my nails after using this product continuously for several weeks. Rich and creamy. Easy to apply I have super weak nails that chip and break like crazy‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve used this daily for only a week and notice a huge difference in the strength of my nails. They look healthy, and don‚Äôt break or bend on me! I‚Äôll definitely use this product in between my acrylic sets Didn‚Äôt work The product didn‚Äôt work on my nails like I hoped it would. I didn‚Äôt see a big difference in the hardness. Too soon to determine if my nails will be stronger as a result of using this product. I had never used this before but I recommend it to anyone. Not thick enough; it goes on watery and doesn‚Äôt seem to penetrate well. Used it for a month, twice a day, and it didn‚Äôt really help to harden my nails. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, it could work for you. Who knows. I think I‚Äôll go back to Healthy Hoof, that does the job and it‚Äôs cheaper. I have always suffered from dry skin around my nails. I've only been using this product for about a week and I've already noticed a tremendous difference in the skin around my nails. It is no longer dry or peeling. It is now soft and supple. My nails are growing faster than normal and do seem stronger. I can't say for sure if it is this lotion or the new nail polish or a combination of the 2. No matter this lotion has softened my skin unlike any other lotion. For that alone it is well worth the money. Also worth noting, a tiny bit of this goes a very long way. You are supposed to use it 3 times a day but even so this jar will last a long time. Product smells nice but did not strengthen my nails at all. Not sure about strengthening my nails as a gel manicure destroyed my nails but it sure does help with softening my cuticles and area surrounding my fingers Didnt work! I didn‚Äôt notice any improvement to my nails but it is a good moisturizer and smells good This was a total waste of my money & time! Despite applying the product as instructed, my nails became weaker & kept breaking at the tips. Not really sure about this yet.  Its a hard cream.  I expected it to be thinner like a lotion.  Its greasy so you have to wipe your hands off after.I really haven't been using it long enough to give a review on whether or not it works I have very soft nails and have all my life.  I have tried many products but nothing has really made any difference.  This product is no different.  It did NOTHING!!!  I used it 3 times a day 90% of the time and 2 times a day the other 10%.  My nails are just the same as they ever were.  I will say that my cuticles are soft but you can get that from a good hand cream.  All in all I would of given this a zero but as we know you cant so I am giving it a 1 star and saying that this product is not something I would EVER order again.  Total waste of money. I'm ashamed to admit I have bitten my nails all my life; a disgusting habit. I wanted to quit especially because of COVID concerns. Hard as Hoof quickly transformed my soft, dry, peeling nails into shining, strong, and rock hard nails within a couple of weeks. I kept the product close to where I spend much of my days and evenings so it was convenient for me to easily & quickly massage it onto my nails several times a day. The transformation was truly rapid. My nails have NEVER looked this good! They are healthy, strong, and shining!  I'm so thankful for this outstanding product!  I don't understand why everyone who's purchased it doesn't rave about it. There are many causes of nail problems, and it's reasonable to assume that problems are caused by a diversity of nail deficiencies. I can PROMISE you that if you follow the directions and apply this product 3x day, you will be pleased by the results.  I'm certainly recommending it to all my friends, most whose nails don't look nearly as good as mine do now!! A+++++ This cream is exactly what its called...A product that will make your nails ""Hard as Hoof"" So if your nails are super soft and need strengthening so they can grow, this IS your product!! But if your nails are brittle, dry and on the hard side...DO NOT USE this product!!! I have strong nails that were splitting, peeling and breaking. I saw this product and thought ""oh, something to make my nails strong!"" And bought it, w/o any further thought. I began to see an immediate reaction after my 2nd. use. The nail seemed healthier. So, of course, I was applying it 2 0r 3 times a day. To the horror! Within a week my nails were shattering, like glass, every time a bit of nail grew...it shattered!!! I ended up with jagged edges scratching my face n clipping my nails daily, till it grew out!! Now its Vit E oil...3 Xs daily Cream to strengthen nails-someone recommended this product to me this doesn't work well at all. my nails have not grown or gotten stronger with this product Easy to grow it does not take much product This didn‚Äôt help my nails. They were still dry and brittle. A waste of money. I liked what other users had to say about this product and was hoping it would help my dry, brittle nails.  The first jar proved to be amazing.  Nails grew and were strong enough that I cancelled acrylic nail appointment and kept my own nails.  This second jar though does not seem to being as good a job as the first.  But, it is winter here where I am and therefore house is dryer so am thinking this is what is contributing to my nail problem.  They are the pits right now but will continue using and hopefully they will get better. I have always had weak nails that snag and break constantly, and also a bad habit of biting them. I have been using StoptheBite for awhile: that worked great at hardening my nails, but I wanted to try something that didn‚Äôt taste like death if I accidentally touched my mouth. This stuff smells great and has helped my cuticles look healthier and my nails a little shinier, but there has been absolutely no difference in the strength of my nails: they are still peeling, breaking, and snagging as usual. I apply 2-3 times a day, so short of quitting my job to have time to rub this lotion in my nails constantly, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs supposed to help. So I bought this to try to get my long nails to not break. Within a week of trying this all my nails broke. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, the reviews were so positive. Maybe it just didn‚Äôt work for me. It is very nice for your cuticles, and smells really yummy. I can't really give this a chance to work over time because the scent is so strong that I can't bear to use it. It makes my cuticles very thick and hard to cut. Not really sure if it helped my nails. They are still very thin and bark easily. This works! I have used tons of different lotions,creams oils for dry cuticles/nails. I work in dry and dusty environment. My nails are slowly starting to grow and my cuticles not dry staying moisturized. Great product and I have recommended it to several people. Have only used this for about a week or so, using it because My nails can be fragile when they starting growing. So using this to see if they can keep grown without breaking. Its very moisturizing and has a light coconut smell which I love. So far so good! It makes your nails worse unless you use it every day multiple times. If you stop for a while, they become weaker then ever. Was great when I started using it, but when I missed a day or so my cuticles cracked and split my nails became more brittle than they were before.I stopped becyi started havtan allergic reaction I‚Äôve been using the product for three weeks and have seen no change. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not doing any harm and it smells nice and feels luxurious but ultimately my nails are still brittle and my cuticles ragged. Would not but again. DON T KNOW ABOUT THE GROWTH YET BY MY NAILS FEEL BETTER AND I HAVE TRIED LOTS OF PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS I DID NOT KNOW THERE WERE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH NAILS AS BAD AS MINE I HOPE I CAN HAVE NAILS EVEN SHORT WITHOUT SPLITTING AND BRAKING Product did not strengthen nails but made them weak and constantly breaking. Splitting nails are almost gone, after 7 months of use 2 times a day. My nails look better than they have for a long time. Have to use it a long time faithfully. I have not used it as often as they tell you to, but even just once a day about five times a week, I have noticed a great improvement in my nail strength. I noticed an immediate change in my nails and it‚Äôs a GREAT moisturizer for cuticles! I can't give a rating yet I just received it and have only used 1 day. This moisturized but didn't have any effect on hardening my nails?! Not working for me at all.I was using not only 3 times a day as recommended, but 5. Does not absorb.  Very strong coconut fragrances. Prefer the Healthy Hoof. No over powering scent I got this about a month ago.  I‚Äôm using it twice a day and my nails are definitely stronger and tougher.  But I‚Äôm still experiencing some peeling at the tips. So I‚Äôve cut them down a bit to go be them another chance.  I would recommend this product to a friend. Didn't see a difference The ""cream"" was Used and very hard. No opportunity to use it. Nor that I would buy it again! Did nothing for my nails that regular cream didn‚Äôt It works well. Not magic.The scent is disgustingly sweet coconut. I‚Äôm not sure I can put up with it to keep using. It‚Äôs gross. I will continue to use this as it's the only product that has made a difference in my split nails. Not sure that it has hardened my nails, but it has moisturized them enough so that the layers have grown together and my nails look normal for the first time in months. I have only used product for a short time but my nails are looking  better. I purchased this to help rehab my nails after a bad experience with dip nails. I used it periodically throughout the day for a few weeks but have not noticed a positive difference. I will keep using it until it runs out because I do like how it moisturizes my cuticle. I just don't see an improvement in my nails, which is why I purchased it. Smells great and works overnight This didn't work for my nails because i don't have time to rub it into my nails all day long. You have to be consistent with this for it to work. Plus my hands are in cleaners such as dish soap, lysol, etc every day. I love the smell though and it's good hand lotion. Very moisturizing the scent is a bit strong for my liking. My nails are stronger but I'm also taking B12. Not sure where credit belongs, might be a combination of the two. Pleasant hand cream, nothing more than that I have the weakest nails. They break, they split, they have huge ridges, it's awful. I was cautiously optimistic about this product, but I really did see results. My nails were stronger. I don't know if they grew faster or anything, but they grew without breaking, which is the same or better. It‚Äôs been a month I‚ÄômUsing this  product butDid not see any difference at all :( The product did not work at all. My nails are the same ): Fast shipment I love the smell and used the product at night to moisture my cuticles. After a month or so, my nails aren‚Äôt breaking like they used to. Kinda can‚Äôt believe how much stronger they are. After weeks of use,  nails stil chop and break This stuff really works. My natural nails are longer than they ever have been in just fifteen days. They used to chip and flake like bad, but so far so good Smells great, made my cuticles looks nice - but overall did nothing for my flimsy thin nails. It moisturizes, but so far I really can‚Äôt see any difference. Just received today. Just received yesterday, so can't really review.  Sadly, it is very sweet-smellyingto me.  Others may like the smell. Does everything but make nails hard as hoof go figure."
41,"Harperton Nail Clippers Set - 2 Pack Stainless Steel, Professional Fingernail & Toenail Clippers for Thick Nails",Beauty and Personal Care,"I was crazy about these when I first used them and bought several pair for my family but they do not stay sharp but for a couple of uses. So disappointed!!! I personally believe that the Halperton nail clippers are overrated. The small clippers were basically useless on my fingernails and the large clippers left jagged edges on my fingernails and toenails. After using the clippers on my nails I had to file them to keep my nails from snagging on my clothing. I would not purchase Halperton nail clippers again. Easy to hold and use These leave nails chipped e v e r y single time. Would NOT recommend or buy again. Blades are sharp. And open up farther than regular clippers. I have a couple thick nails that have been hard to cut, untill I got these. Great product. These clippers are difficult for me to review. My daughter likes them, but I found them hard to press down. I am a senior citizen with arthritis. The clippers were sharp and cut well when I could get them down far enough.  I gave them to my daughter and granddaughter who likes them. The young granddaughter was thrilled to get the fingernail clippers and the daughter likes the toenail clippers. Maybe I got a bad nail clipper but even the first use would cause my nails to break off and I would jab it on something and it would pull apart.  I hate these clippers ughh Better than most clippers sold in drug stores. I don't have time. At first these were great, finally a clipper that could cut through my nails with ease. In just over a year they dulled to the point they can't make it through my nail. I had high hopes, but these are about the same quality as dollar store nail clippers. They were ok at first but then quickly dulled and didn‚Äôt cut though the nails fully. The second time I used them they fell apart. I was able to put them back together but I feel like it‚Äôll just keep happening. The product is well made and works terrific. The fingernail clippers click twice when cutting fingernails. The finish is coming off of the handle. I ordered these because of the great reviews and never liked any of the mail clippers that we can find in stores.  I am very anxious to use it for the tor nails.  I can‚Äôt find a decent one.  The nail clippers are very sharp.  I will come back here to tell how it worked ‚Ä¶ Product worked as described.  I would recommend this to others. Bought due to the great reviews & sadly disappointed; back to Revlon‚Äôs nail clippers. The finger nail clipper is not as sharp as I expected, but the toe nail clipper definitely does not disappoint.  Quality and material substantial and aesthetically pleasing. The nail cutter set looked great but not what I needed for very thick toe nail. The toe nail cutter is longer and easy to hold but works for regular nails. I bought this based on the good reviews, but not happy with them at all. These are easy to use and sharp. I would recommend them to everyone who wants great quality clippers. I used the fingernail clippers once and they fell apart. Returning product. Not sharp.  They don‚Äôt cut cleanly and leave a sharp edge behind.  You‚Äôll need a file on hand to take off the edge these create. I didn't care for these , toe nail clipper wouldn't even cut my fingernails. These seem well made.  The handle is beefier than normal.  But the handle never was an issue so it really doesn't add any benefit.  It cuts nails fine, but not better than a decent set for 1/3 the cost IMHO. Meh. Not that sharp and doesn‚Äôt give a solid feel when clipping These Harperton nail clippers are very impressive. They are very high quality, sharp and easy to manipulate. Much better than those found at the local drugstore. A terrific purchase! They are heavy duty.  My family found them not a sharp or easy to use as hoped.  They will cut thru thick nails, but  tended to snap or break nails (I used after long shower to they were soft) so I wasn't pleased.  On my more delicate toe and fingernails,I feel like it breaks or snaps nail as opposed to cutting.  I will purchase something else. I selected this product based on reviews. three years after I purchased, the clippers are now rusty. I do not use these in water or in the shower. When not in use, they are just sitting in a dry medicine cabinet. :(  I wish they made these in a rust free material. I've had better. These had such great reviews I thought I'd spend a little more on a nice set of nail Clippers. I took them out of the box and the first time i went to use them, they fell apart. The toe nail clippers are sturdier but the fingernail clippers  are flimsy and are the same quality as a dollar pair. I thought these would be sharp and great for toenails. They are not. They are turned in so much that it's hard to even get the clipper under the nail to clip. These clippers give a sharp, smooth cut with minimal effort. I really like the grip. It's really comfortable  & easy to squeeze. I also appreciate the little yellow bag that holds the clippers. I never have to dig through the drawer to find them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these or buy another set for travel, etc. Not that great I've bought nail clippers at the usual department stores for years, brands like Revlon, Trim, etc. I was looking to replace a set so I researched the Harperton clippers and other brands. The reviews on this set were very good 4.6 out of 5 stars, over 10, 000 reviews and an Amazon Choice for high ratings and a well priced product. They are well made, sharp and ergonomic, but are not outstanding as some reviews claimed. They are actually a little shorter and slightly wider than the department store brands, but do not seem to cut any better and have no swing out nail file attached to the device. In my opinion, they are no better than the department stores and are more expensive. I bought these a couple of years ago when I went and looked for nail clippers that were nice and sharp.  Based on the reviews and description these seemed like the right ones.  In terms of sharpness they've been great.  My kids actually ask me to use these instead of the previous ones we had.  That being said these literally fell to pieces the last time I used them.  If that hadn't happened they'd definitely be 5 star. I would say it is noticeably better than my cheap run of the mill clippers. Actually hated clipping toe nails because of sensitivity from years ago cutting to close. These give you better and I mean better control and have me looking forward to cutting both Mani and Pedicure.If you're on the fence especially if you are use to really cheap pairs go ahead and pencil these badboys in. Plus they come with a small pouch to store them in which was a bonus. Would definitely buy again and highly recommend. Not much to say but these work a lot better than my older nail clippers. I have no complaints The small clippers seem to work ok. The large, on the other hand, don't. The edges of fingernails cut with the large clippers are ragged and uneven. On tougher toenails, they're pretty awful. They can barely cut thru toenails and seem to more like crush their way through the nail instead of cutting thru. Disappointing, for sure. I bought these after I lost a Brand new pair of Revlon nail clippers. I found the lost pair the same day these arrived. I tried both back to back, and the Revlon clippers were superior in every way besides ease of holding. These were easy to hold. However, overall they were disappointing. My son lives this product Precision cut I have purchased it the nail clipper as in NEW condition, however, it comes with seal opened. For a personal item like this, it is very uncomfortable to use as it may have been returned or used by someone else. Not as tight as I need. Arthritic hands have a hard time gripping these. The larger one is actually small for what it‚Äôs supposed to do. To cut fingernails and toenails. Fingernail clippers were sharp, but not easy to hold with arthritis in my hands. Toenail clippers were so dull, I could not even cut toenails!! very nice dont fall out of my hands The description clearly states that there are 2 clippers ‚Äúa set‚Äù but yet there was only one clipper ‚Äútoenail ‚Äú in the package? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Not as Advertised.  No easier to hold than my previous...AND...They don't cut as cleanly.  Will return if possible. My husband wanted clippers and the reviews looked good so we ordered them. After only a few months the smaller clippers came apart. The pin fell out. Pin can't be found. Clippers useless. Smaller clipper broke after two weeks... it is heavy and thick, not able to reach deep in the nail. The two edges are not aligned at all, even worse than those in the dollar store. I received a badly crushed nailclipper box with two nail clippers that had nail dust or fungus or something. I am afraid to use them. Will be sending back. I bought these and have used the toenail clippers 2x.  The toenail clippers fall apart everytime I use them.  I wish I would have returned them after I got them. These are sharp clippers. They do not clip as well as the cheap clippers. Definitely not worth the cost. The thing I like most is how sharp they are and easy to use I'm so disappointed. The fingernail sized set is amazing! Best cut I've ever had. But the larger ones, the reason I got these, don't cut at all. My husband has very thick and difficult toenails and I was looking for something to make trimming easier. I'm bummed. These were great clippers that are very sharp but didn't last long. I noticed that the bar that holds it skill together was pulling to the side but didn't think much of it. I went to use them today and when I opened it the bar snapped and the whole thing fell apart into pieces.Pretty annoyed with this as everything about them was great except the quality apparently. Not what its cracked up to be. Lightweight, cheap seeming materials. Not very sharp. Ended up with jagged toenails. Toenail clipper not long enough. A little hard to hold because small and light. No nail file. Prefer my old drugstore clippers I was trying to replace with something better. Would not order from this company again. Finally spent a little more money and got a better quality clipper than drug store brands. Cutting is in inconsistent. I bought a Target product (Revlon) at 1/6 the price that does a much better job of trimming my nails. Harperton is a waste of money. Not very sharp and to not come with file"
42,"Honeywell HT-900 TurboForce Air Circulator Fan Black, Small",Home and Kitchen,"It‚Äôs weak Simply put, does not produce enough air to properly cool a small room. Never mind a larger room. The screws to remove the grill are embedded too deep for the screwdrivers I had on hand - makes little sense to buy a special screwdriver to clean this thing.It also makes squeaky noises so had to trash this. Works pretty well Did not have forceful air not what I wanted,  turbo is deceiving. I loved this for about a week then the fan start to blow poorly that I could easily forget it was on. Had to exchange it but the other fan last long enough for me return window to close. Good throw away fan Great After my former desk fan stopped working mid-operation, I needed a new fan. I landed on this fan, and after seeing the poem review (if you haven't seen it, find it), I one-clicked this. This fan lives up to that poem and more. Controlled, low-volume fan sound (enough for a little white noise, but not like sitting on the wing of a jumbo jet), three highly efficient settings, the lowest setting is enough to have me put on a light long-sleeve shirt when it's 80F+ outside. This is more than a desk fan, but it's still on my desk and making me feel like I have air conditioning. For how well this fan works, it's a steal at this price. Highly recommended. this is good This is the worst fan I have ever had. Becaaaaause it barely blows air! What a piece of garbage. If it‚Äôs about 50 degrees outside but you want the sound of air moving slightly more quickly than it normally does inside your house then go ahead and buy this. Fan is very low power' air movement, Returned and received notice of credit was issued, but only the notice not my money, why? It‚Äôs terrible unless you‚Äôre sitting 2 feet awa It‚Äôs a great little fan but is no where near as strong as they say you can‚Äôt feel it 25 feet away Horrible quality! Great litter fan with a powerful motor.  It does reach far distance for the size.  It can be adjusted by tilting either up or down to direct the air further into the space.  I would recommend it! Read the details and they make it sound like a tornado in a box. It is a tiny fan for a tiny room. It seems quiet but I doubt I would have bought these had I held the box in my hand beforehand. Go buy a box fan. It's cheaper and moves more air than this tiny thing. Not enough power, especially for a Honeywell product. It‚Äôs a bit noisy for the amount of air it puts out. It doesn‚Äôt make the air any cooler, it just circumvent the room temperature air, which is fine, but I would prefer a less noisy one or at least a heavier duty one for this noise level. First fan broke in only a week then I bought a new one Never received this item. Tried contacting them, there was no respond. Lasted a couple months of steady On use. Buy a different brand. Not much power at all For some reason these fans do not cool as well as the same fan in white. It does what it is supposed to do once started but the turn knob is recessed in the back and hard to reach and turn on unless you are standing over it... Does the job for my small living space. I like the compact size, and there are three settings. I usually have it on the highest setting. It's small but mighty! I have bought fans that join just like this but we‚Äôre much stronger. Mine may be defective, but it is very weak I use this in our 5th wheel.  It will mount on the wall or on the dresser.  Can easily sleep with it on all night..  note:  it does run on 110v (just in case people may think it‚Äôs a 12v fan) I bought this fan because I bought it two years ago and works great still running in matter of fact what do you know the new fans motor is smaller and the fan blade is smaller same housing.  I would buy the Amazon Basics fan it has more power and is cheaper.  Honeywell putting cheap parts inside I guess it's pretty decent for a cheap fan that last this long Please do not buy. These were good fans at one point. I have three newer ones purchased over the past year.The motors are slowing the wind and breaking. It's like the power isn't going through correctly.Each fan has its quirks on how/when it'll work. Two only work if they are literally UPSIDE DOWN, which means they have to be propped up for usage. One's motor won't even start at all unless upside down.These aren't the same fans that they used to be a few years before. It's a shame. Seals on the box were all cut, the manual was missing, and the box looks like it had been sitting in a dumpster. Fan lasted around 18 months before it starting slowing down and making loud squeaking noises. Completely quit working maybe a month later. I took the cover off, unscrewed the motor and oiled both of the ‚Äúbearings‚Äù (which are really just bushings) and the fan is like new again. Although this seems like the best option for travel and camping, it definitely was not as powerful or even close to what I was expecting, I returned it. I use this fan to circulate air in my motor home. It does a very good job. For the price it‚Äôs a great buy. Does not blow hard I have the same exact fan from the 90s end it blows way harder when I put them side-by-side are the gnu one fan blades are really small and the motor is tiny I have the same exact fan but from 1998 still going strong it blows it so hard I wanted to get another one turns out they don‚Äôt make them how the same The one from 98 blows 10 times harder than the one from 2020 which is a shame . Hardly any power and get slower and slower as time goes on. Stops working after 6 months of use I bought two of these hoping they‚Äôd be enough to get air circulating in a basement room that‚Äôs 8‚Äôx15‚Äô.  For starters, I just tried out one of them and was not impressed (couldn‚Äôt really feel air movement across the room, and there wasn‚Äôt a noticeable difference after leaving it on all night). In the end, I decided to return them both. Bought 2 and they both died after 1+years. Other than that they‚Äôre fantastic! I stopped using this fan because it makes an annoying sound. I wish it would adjust forward towards my face, but it doesn't. I have yet to trash it, but I need to. I bought this fan to cool off my classroom and man does it work! It's super quiet and has great air pressure. Keeps my room cool all day. Awesome quiet personal space fan Sort of noisy at highest speed.  Place it over floor heat diffuser to use as a duct booster.  Works OK I'm comparing this fan to my Woozoo fan that is four times the price an is louder:Granted, there is no remote or other electonic components (timer, etc.) but for 15 bucks, you can't beat this fan.It is possible the Woozoo uses less power, but I don't know the answer.I highly recommend this fan. very loud. Pretty loud for a small little fan. Works fine but you need to be directly in the path to feel anything at all. Also the switch design is very strange and dumb. Not sure I would recommend For the price, the size, and truly functional. It‚Äôs Very, very quiet. I am happy with this product, couldn‚Äôt be better! IT IS a good product. I bought this a while back because I cant sleep without a fan and needed a small one for my room. This was great, made a good bit of noise, and pushed a lot of air but it didnt last long at all (maybe a year). I did usemit all night every night so it was used a lot but I have had fans last a lot longer with the same usage. Very disappointed in this fan.  Style, design, size, noise level fine, but power output/airflow totally unacceptable.  I have an old Honeywell fan, same model purchased about 10 years ago, still running, that far exceeds the new model's power and output.  Like other reviews, this fan's high setting equals my still running old fan's lowest setting!!!  I do not recommend.  Manufacturer needs to pay attention to all these bad reviews. Great little powerful fan.  This is second one I bought. This is the perfect size to put on top of my cabinet in my bathroom for after showers. I thought the high would be more powerful, a little disappointing, but still does a good job for what I got it for. I bought this fan in May 2019, and it has stopped working after less than 1-1/2 of intermittent use.  I definitely will not get the same one or same brand again. It only has a 1-year warranty. Fan wont spin anymore after 1 year of use. Good size, quiet, only moderately powerful. Roughly the size of a basketball, this thing on max level is barely a breeze to the point that I needed 2 of these fans to do the cooling job I needed. If you are buying this thinking that its powerful - dont. It is awfully weak, especislly for its size. I was very disappointed. I really liked this fan initially. Then 3 months after purchase it would barely spin, but it would slowly get up to speed. A month later it would not spin at all. Completely dead.Went back to using an 8 year old cheapo desk fan which still works fine. Pros: Plenty of circulation for a smallish fan, even on lowest settingCons: Noise level is higher than I was hoping for for small office and/or living room use. It's not super loud. I seem to be pretty sensitive to fan noise, so my rating takes that and the amount of air circulation produced into account (my actual rating for my intended purposes would be lower, based on the noise level) Not a very powerful fan... I‚Äôm surprised that it‚Äôs made by Honeywell. I guess the Vornados ARE worth the $ I love this fan. You need to be sure what you are looking for though. If you are seeking a lot of air movement and noise this is not for you, but if you want to feel a gentle breeze when gong to bed which is what I wanted then you can't beat the product or the price. I placed it on my bedside table about 3 feet from the bed. Sleeping like a baby. Very weak air flow out of any fan I've ever chosen. Regret buying this fan because I'm sure there is way better fans for the price. I was very surprised at how under powered this thing was since just a few years ago thesewere good fans. This fan motor quite less than 30 minutes of operation on the first night. Don‚Äôt waste your money . It doesn‚Äôt throw off any cool air at all. My first Honeywell HT-900 fan came from a thrift store over a decade ago, it lasted for years and always ran great. Since it finally quit, I have purchased several more from Amazon/eBay/etc. They've all been genuine Honey(bucket, oh)well, and I'm lucky if they last even one full year. I think what they did was a mild redesign cosmetically, while at the same time really cheaping-out on the bearings and/or motor internally. The only way they seem to last at all is if you run them constantly for the season, once they start having trouble it will be exponentially exacerbated by turning the fan off and on as needed - in my experience. Designed Obsolescence, from the people screaming about Climate Change...ain't it great!? I purchased this fan as the description and reviewers said it was quiet. I found the fan pretty loud. It is loud enough that I need to turn it off when I'm on the phone as it is sitting 5 feet from me in my office. It moves the air great and is not super ugly to look at. I will keep the fan as it works good, but will keep looking for a quieter fan. Great fan with amazing power. Great for sleeping ‚ÄúTurbo‚Äù in name only, this was a very disappointing purchase. I bought this to replace an older Honeywell fan that I‚Äôve had for years, and I figured that as long as I was buying new, I might as well try to improve on the noise level of the previous unit and buy a model known for quieter operation.Oh, it‚Äôs quiet, alright‚Ä¶because it barely works! Even the highest setting barely produces more wind than the average handheld desk fan. I could probably beg my kid to fold an accordion paper fan and fan me with it for a few minutes, and his output would likely exceed that of this Honeywell.So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned: quiet fan operation doesn‚Äôt do much good if you‚Äôre still uncomfortably warm. Give me a fan with the roaring decibels of a jet plane taking off, as long as it works! Will never buy this again! Only work twice before I crapped out It's a good fan, it is very loud but gives a crisp cold breeze. I got it to get me through the Alabama summer heat. I pretty much use it non stop throughout the day, during my entire sleep and keep it on throughout the day, giving it 2-3 hours of rest. It's held up nicely... have had it for 2 and a half months. Good little fan. Average noise kevel.  Definitely for small area. To be honest, do not buy again. This item is work well in a small room, But the noise is a little bit loud. The only drawback is it is very difficult to clean. I have a tiny room and it can‚Äôt cool it down! I hate it Impotent, quiet, low speed. Was shocked when I turned it on just how weak the airflow was. Returning Two weeks old and working half as well as when I unboxed it  Huge dust collector. Fan is a bit noisy but it serves its purpose. I like that its compact and easily movable. My kids move it to wherever the are in the house. We bought 2 because everyone in the house wants to use the fan for themselves. Not strong enough airflow on high from 4' away. Its not the fastest fan in this scale but it does the job at about 10 feet.. works well in a small room 15x15 to blow air around. Great for home or Office. Portable, light weight. Great fan pushes allot of air and it is not super loud. My only complaint is that it could come with a remote to adjust the speed and the dials and adjustments are pretty stiff This was a pretty good fan was something got caught in it like a thread and it stopped working When I purchased this fan I had forgotten that this particular model does not tilt downwards. Many customers complained about this in their reviews.  Also the strength of air on low and medium is useless.  On high it's not that great but adequate for my needs.  Why it is named turbo force high velocity I do not know.  The description doesn't fit the fan.  I wanted to leave this fan in the bathroom directed towards the tub so that after I shower it would eliminate water and moisture.  I'm very disappointed with this product. This is the 3rd Honeywell HT-900 fan I've bought in 4 yrs.  The first one broke down after 2 yrs which I consider negligible since I used it 8-12 hrs daily.  High output air flow.  It's noisy since it pushes out a lot of air.  Quiet motor = weak output.  Wish it was easier to clean the grill and fan blades, though.  I would take mine apart 2x/yr and wash the blades and grill.  Still, a cheap investment that does what it's supposed to do. I have always used this exact fan. I have one that I've owned for years. I purchased another for  different room back in Dec 2019. It was very loud out of the box and is already dead. You can feel the air from quite a distance though. Trying to decide if I will buy another. I've thrown the box away so I can't send it back under warranty. Great fan, loud at high speed but is to be expected. this fan barely moves air. it's unreal how weak it is. if you want an oversized desk fan that does a terrible job, then this is the fan for you!  don't buy this fan.at least it was cheap i guess... Fan is perfect for small spaces. Quiet fan for a dorm. Product not working Nothing turbo about it Yes. Quiet and energy efficient...it doesn't work after in use for 5 minutes. Nothing on the ""trouble shooting"" list applies or helps. Not sure what I am to do at this time. I will buy some Fuses and maybe te fan may work. I received the fan today and I need the fan now. Oh well, I am certain the store was unaware of the default.  Life happens. Nice for table use.  Good price!s This test works well for its size. It is quiet for a fan on low and medium. It is easy to manage. Fan lasted five minutes before it made a terrible noise and died. I use this when I do keratin treatments Small, compact, quiet and powerful.  Sturdy and stable. The highest setting isnt very high compared to a different branded fan I had before this one that was the same size for about the same price. It'd be better for a small office space/cubicle type of settings, not a room space, in my opinion. The fan is extremely noisy like why!! Like it‚Äôs so annoying the sound drives me crazy stay clear from this the price doesn‚Äôt even matter it‚Äôs just out right Annoying fix this! Dad takes it out on his balcony.  He seems to like it. Loved this fan at first, but after 5 months it barely moves are as well as creaks every time the blades make a rotation. I honestly do not think this fan will last much longer which sucks because I use to like Honeywell! Squeal, makes it useless. I got this small fan because I wanted it to sit on top of my tall dressers. I figured since it can rotate it would be able to point downwards towards the bed. Unfortunately this is not the case it either points outward and any range to point upward. I think the is a silly feature because I can't think of a reason to have my fan pointing at the ceiling but that can be just me. Either way I do like the output from this fan and I enjoy the fact it is small, quiet, and blows well but I don't understand the range of motion it has. I have used many Honeywell products earlier including fans along with other electronic products. This Fan is good to the most extent. Remember, this doesn't have rotation. It is good at a fixed place. Different levels of speed adjustment. It gives some noise at higher speeds. The fan itself is perfect for what I required. My only complaint is that the fan was dirty and had obviously been used as it had dirt on the fan blades and cover. I was not aware that I was purchasing a used fan. Removing the cover required removal of 5 screws and was easily accomplished. Cleaning was also easy but could have been improved by designing the fan blades for simpler removal. Bedroom better circulation of air Died after a few months junk It is small but NOT mighty... no turbo action here... does work well in my work station... I hoped it would be more powerful. GOOD FAN Greet fan for a small space. It doesn‚Äôt have quite the power punch that I hoped for. Living in Florida is extremely hot, even with ceiling fans, so the 2 fans I purchased came in handy.  Put 1 in my garage, and 1 in my enclosed patio to cool it off, and was very surprised how much air came out of these fans for being so small.  Am very happy with my purchases. Very quiet, but don't mistake this for a high-power summer fan. It's smaller than it appears. Pretty good for $15 bucks. Hair got tangled in this fan from my house and I swear it never worked again. The height was an issue for me too. Total waste of money. There is nothing I don't like about it it's  Efficient it's quiet it does the jobFor it to be so small it does a great job Hi speed is like lo..don't waste money on this junk After about a month it'll start making really loud squeaking noises. I had one of these several years ago and they were great so when I saw Honeywell still made them (and at an decent price I paid $15, fan prices are ridiculous nowadays...)  I jumped on it and bought two (that should of been my first clue...). Well all I can say is what a disappointment....the Turboforce has turned into something far less deserving then its name.  When I pulled it out of the box I noticed the casing looked and felt almost identical to what I owned in the past but then I noticed the fan blades.... puny, they dont even fill the casing (second clue...).  They look to me like the blades that go in one of those chinsy clamp fans you buy for your car that plugs into the cigarette lighter that were around back in the day.  So then I plugged it in and it had been switched on already so it started immediately.  With the force of the air that came out my initial thought was ""thats not bad for the low speed"".  And of course, that wasnt the low speed...wasnt even medium speed, yes it was on high.  The turboforce had officially been neutered...and from reading the other comments not only did they downsize the blades I now know they put a electric smaller motor in it as well....I would paid $5 or $8 more for the original but then they probably would have wanted $30 for it.  Oh well back to Amazon they go... Bought it for my son and was surprised how well the fan cools his room Quiet fan but moves very little air. Very disappointing. Bought as replacement for failing fan but this one blows less than failing one! Had it for 5 months and it already stopped working Does not put out very much air and pretty noisy. The fan was working well for the first two years. Then, in the final year, the motor became increasingly louder. This week, it failed to turn on. Love this fan! It‚Äôs a good fan with great airflow for my apartment bedroom! They claim you can feel at 25 feet away I doubt you could feel it 2.5 feet away this is got to be the weakest fan I have ever seen in my life it's not even worth turning on cuz he doesn't do anything but spin does it move any air don't waste your time Bought this little fan to sit on a dresser and it‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs great for small spaces and small rooms. For a fan that size, I was impressed with how well it worked but still managed to maintain a low noise level. I would recommend! Thought it would be stronger. It does the job but not as great as I hoped. Dont be fooled by the name. I read all positive reviews and ordered this so called Turbo fan cos i needed to spread the heat in entire room just like they said in their description. When i plugged it in and turned it on to highest speed, i was hoping to get a powerful breeze like same size Vornado fan which i own. Its not even 10% powerful on highest speed. First two speed is as good as flapping your hand. Total Disappointment. Save your money. Don't waste your money it hardly makes any noise because it hardly ever blows anything I'm being honest you can blow harder out of your mouth than this fan can at its highest speed I was very disappointed honesty they should just cut the plug on it and replace it with a lighter one so you can plug it into your lighter might work in your car but definitely not for your house or office very week doesn't work very well I got stuck with it because I left out of town so I didn't have a chance to return it when I came back so save your money I‚Äôve used this brand of fan for years. I always keep a backup. Can‚Äôt sleep without it on my nightstand and a must for getting ready in bathroom. I preferred the earlier not as quiet versions because I not only use it for air but noise reduction. I bought this to replace my sons bedroom fan. His room is maybe 10x12 at the most. On high you can barely hear that the fan is running and the air flow is what our old fan was on ‚Äúlow‚Äù setting. We are going to replace this and use it for a desk fan. Didn't not work out of the box.  Can see the motor exposed inside as well.  Junk This is my third  Honeywell HT-900 TurboForce Air Circulator Fan Black, Small.  They work great and the force of air they give is amazing.  It will go across the room. Unfortunately, they never last more than almost two years.  I called the manufacturer, and Honeywell.  They only give a one year warranty, nothing they can do for me.  So, I guess I will have to purchase another brand.  Buyer beware. I'll start with what I like first. I like that even on high, it's not noisy at all.  I have it in our living room, and on high, we can still hear the TV just fine. And in our living room, with the windows open, there's not much air movement.  So sometimes I point it upwards, just to get some air circulation and it works great for that purpose too.Now for what I don't like about it.  In the description,  it says turbo. In my opinion,  it's not turbo at all. I originally wanted it for our bedroom,  but it's not as powerful as we'd prefer for the bedroom,  so instead of returning,  we use it in the living room.  If you're looking for a powerful fan, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a quiet fan, with a gentle breeze, this is for you.  We've had it for several months,  no issues. That's my second one. I have it running 24 hours a day on low or middle speed. I use it to push air through a home server with 6 drives. It helps keeping them cool. It is noisy but does the job. The previous one (same model) died after a few years but they are probably not made for that kind of job, Still for the price, it works ! Hardly hear it"
43,"Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Saute, Yogurt Maker, Sterilizer, and Warmer, 6 Quart, 13 One-Touch Programs",Home and Kitchen,"This is the third Duo Nova I‚Äôve purchased in the past couple months and each one fails within the first 1-2 uses. It will show ‚Äúfood burn‚Äù during the initial 3 cup water-only test and you‚Äôll smell melting plastic. Then if it doesn‚Äôt outright fail then, it will when you get 15mins into cooking something. What will happen is that it just dies and won‚Äôt come back to life. I had read that the issue was the temperature-based fuse but after taking the trouble to solder in a replacement higher-temp fuse it still died upon the first use. I‚Äôm now convinced that this is a defective model that they need to recall. I can‚Äôt say whether this product worked. I never unpacked it. I became frightened of the stories of injury law suits from malfunctioning of the safety features that were made to protect from the very explosions that occurred from safety precautions giving incorrect clearances saying the presssure had fallen to safe enough levels to open the pot Very frustrating, every time I use it, it says my food is burning, and sometimes shuts off. Recently put setting on meat for 35 minutes and in under 5 minutes, beeps and says food is burning. I'll try to return it if I can. Two stars is generous! We had this instant pot just over a year and it died. And we don‚Äôt use it very often. There is a one year warranty but it‚Äôs 40 days over the 1 year. It was very useful but disappointing. Our good ole crockpot has lasted 20 years. I gave mine away and I am sorry I did.  Quite a few of these new - modern gadgets are confusing on how to use.  We ""old folk"" need easier instructional language, or show and tell, Every time i cook is says burned food. My other instant pot never did this. Hat it. Wish my other one didn't break Have only made a few 5-6 meals in this but all have been quick easy and tasty we were looking for a good option to use in our home and we also want to be able to can food. The website claims you can, cann food with this but you actually can only can certain products and not very versatile to use for canning. It was good while it lasted use it 15 Times be careful with the saut√© feature use mine to get a 15 minute sear and it burned out the control panel so it‚Äôs junk noW other than that it worked  fine. I don't like the inside I really wanted to like this instapot. I gave away my slow cooker in hopes to get all in one. The one feature I was excited about was the rice cooking feature. I've used it three times and the rice is always gooey and sticks to the pan. It wastes rice and is hard to clean. I used it one other time for slow cooking beans and they did not turn out that well. I've read all of the instructions but just not happy with how it works. I can't return it since I've used it several times so a waste of money for me. Bit of a problem cleaning release valve Cooks well.Not user friendly- complicated. No instruction manual It was a gift for someone Only lasted a year! We use the instant pot regularly- at least three times a week. We started with the 6 qt then upgraded to the 8 qt.Now after a year it stopped working. It will not hold pressure rendering it kind of useless.Can‚Äôt afford a new one. Loved it This is a life changer!!!! Wife goes to use it for the first time since I bought it at Christmas and no moisture collector. Had to buy a replacement which will take 6 days to get. Wife is livid!!!! Bought this over a rice cooker because I thought I would get a better bang for my buck since the thing can handle meat and other stuff. So far, I've found that it's best at the sorts of things that you can, in fact, make in a rice cooker, such as rice and steel-cut oats, plus some odds and ends like hard-boiled eggs and a salted caramel cheesecake I tried out. For everything else, it's no better than using traditional appliances at best, and mediocre at worst, like the time when I tried making shredded chicken in it. It seems like the people who are most likely to get the most out of it are people who aren't that great at cooking, prefer the convenience of tossing everything into the pot and not having to pay that much attention to it, or don't have access to a full kitchen yet don't want to rely on takeout or ready-made meals all the time. If that describes you, I'm not begrudging you; it's just not for me. The air fryer lid works great, too, but that's a separate product. If this thing were to break, I'd probably shell out for a fancy Zojirushi rice cooker and an air fryer, which would take up roughly the same amount of storage space as the Instant Pot and air fryer lid. I've tried buying it TWICE can't seem to justify its use. I've got a good crackpot and anything else I could just as easily cook myself I purchased this at the beginning to quickly cook beans often. It works great! I‚Äôve used it more than I thought I would for many other foods. This Pressure Cooker is giving me Million ideas to cook meals without using the Oven. It is worth the Buy. Ok buy Meal prep for the week has never been easier. It cooks so impressively even throughout the cooker. I hate this thing. I keep trying to make it work but I get the burn error message almost every single time I cook with it, no matter what I make, no matter what recipe I use. I‚Äôm so annoyed!!!!!! I was excited to get a new larger IP to feed my entire family! I love how easy it was to un box and use. 8qt is easy better than my 6qt! What a disappointment this thing turned out to be. All it does is make a mess and cook food in a mediocre and inconsistent fashion. I should have just gotten a crock pot. Don‚Äôt waste your money. Overrated, never cooked the ‚Äúfall apart‚Äù tender roasts as seen on tv.  Many other reviews tell same story Don't buy.. Stay away. I usually don't write reviews but this product made me to. It's not even a week and my ""Rice"" option button not working. What a waste of time and money. Meals are ready in short time.  The recipes I've  used are good but not gourmet. I like that it makes smaller quantities. I bought this about a year ago and used it a couple of times.  Unfortunately the rubber around the cover starts be loosened and it can not hold the pressure anymore.  Not sure what to do? I'm not a good cook and this little machine is perfect and hard to mess up with. This product is okay. I like it but it has an extremely sensitive auto over heat shut off sensor. Id think for something that's a pressure cooker could handle heat?!? I was disappointed over all ya win some ya lose some!! I pulled it out once and haven't used it sense. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I really liked this particular item, but I do wish I had bought the cheaper version. The extra features don‚Äôt seem to improve much. This is made for like two people I can‚Äôt even fit a whole corned beef in it I had to cut it in half. It works good but it‚Äôs so small. I advise to to the bigger one I cooked for four people and we couldn‚Äôt even get seconds The lid locking system is much improved But it came obviously damaged. Contacted Amazon & who I purchased from and was put through so many hoops that I eventually gave up. It works but it's not balanced and not all pieces line up correctly.Disappointed but the cooker itself is great. Love it!!!  Just learning, but try hard boiling eggs. Each and everyone peels like a dream.  And, sooooo easy!!  I‚Äôm looking forward to do a lot more cooking. I now have homemade yogurt firm Pat.  Very delicious.  Carol I hardly used my instant pot, had fault code c6, which its cover limited lifetime warranty, made a claim, and I was told it wasn't there fault do to cooking lentils or other beans and overflowing which it wasn't the case. Just poor warranty service will not buy another. Right out of the box, the first one I bought had a fatal error message, meaning the whole pressure cooking mechanism was bad. I sent it back and Amazon quickly sent a new one. It turns on okay and we'll be trying it out shortly, but there is no condensation collector in the box (there was with the first unit). When I contacted Instant Pot about the first unit, their response was, ""Return it to Amazon."" Not the greatest customer support. I can only imagine the runaround I'll get asking them to send me a condensation collector, so I guess I will have to buy one that is not OEM.I'm an advanced IP/electric pressure cooker user (6 qt and 8 qt), and bought this unit to do side dishes, veggies, etc. I imagine it will work just fine, but I knocked some stars off for the hassle factor. Too many instructions Especially difficult for a older person I am still waiting for 3 quart orings and cup. Have contact them many times still no rely You might need a short lesson on how to run this machine The speed in which I can prepare my meals and only have one pot to clean up.  There are tons of recipes online.  Love it It stopped working after the first timeüôÅ A friend of mine purchased an Instant Pot Duo back in 2017 (or so), and it's worked perfectly for her ever since. Entirely reasonably, she thought to gift me one in January of 2021. Unfortunately the product I received only worked 4 times, but defective items are a possibility. So we made arrangements with Amazon to replace the product. The replacement arrived and worked 6 times. I checked out official Instant Pot guides, some 15+ YouTube videos, countless articles... no dice. It won't seal. Bought new seal rings, new pressure pin caps, nada. It acted like it was pressurizing, the pin rose, the gasket was turned to Sealing... no pressure-steamed food. Just hard as a rock cauliflower, crunchy damp broccoli. Instant Pot really needs to look into their 2020 model releases, because what are the chances that I'd receive not one, but two completely defective models? I use it for a variety of foods including Yogurt. It is fabulous. It is easy to clean, but be sure to remove the ring inside the cover and clean it every time you use the cooker. Didn‚Äôt work after 6 months. I haven't checked out all it's features.  However, it is a lot easier to clean when using the slow cooker feature.  It definitely is lighter than my two crockery slow cookers.  The few times I've used the pressure cooker have worked out well. love love love this pot! It will not disappoint! It is useful and working well. However, the inner pot edge is very sharp. My fingers got cut several times while I was cleaning it. Doesn't work appropriately. I am really upset. I did not receive a COOK BOOK with my purchase. Everyone I know who purchased instant pot received a cook book. I  am so disappointed. Bought this primarily as a rice cooker and for stews and such.  It's really inferior for all functions.  Rice fails every time with a hard clump of semi-burnt rice on the bottom.  Stews are no different than cooking on a stovetop.  Maybe it's a bit faster but as it's all sealed up you can't adjust spices and salt and such as it cooks like you can with a pot that you can uncover.  This is for lazy people that don't like cooking or flavor in their foods.  Literally nothing is improved by this device other than saving a bit of time.  I tried it a lot when I first got it... ""new toy syndrome"" but several months later it's sitting in the cupboard unused and is probably going to the garage awaiting a yard sale or something.Very disappointed. Us this product more than actual oven makes meat tender Multi use product, works great as a pressure cooker and rice maker. This product was delivery without the cook book and the special spoon was supposed to come with.  Those items were to be included as it shows in the video.I like this product but disappointed I did not get those items.Thank you for your attention! Worked beautifully then suddenly,The pot breaks down, electric malfunction perhaps, lights flash, pot dies, customer service, once there, disappears.... Too bad because we were using it for everything. Two more were purchased As gifts, hoping the same defect doesn‚Äôt occur. Best buy I've made this year. Check manufacturer's website for free recipes We have had this product for less than a month and used it maybe a handful of times and it‚Äôs already not working properly. Contacted the manufacturer and even though we paid extra warranty the company itself is not backing up the product and making a list of demands before they can return/replace it. Not happy with my purchase or the way they handle their customers. I do not recommend this product. Bought this for Christmas present. Used a few times and stopped working. More complex than crockpot I used my Insta-Pot three times and on the fourth it did not work.  It does not even turn on.  Complete waste of money as the return window was 30 days.  DO NOT BUY! Outside packaging showed substantial wear and tear. Haven't opened it yet but looks pretty kicked around. This is my second instapot pressure cooker in 2 years!!! Both went out!! For some things, this works great...but other things - I am constantly getting the burned food warning.  It wasn't a good sign when I ran the initial test with water and it told me my food was burning.  With that in mind, I am definitely not comfortable setting this and leaving it running when I am not home - guess for those kind of meals, I'll be sticking to my slow cooker.On the plus side, it's small and doesn't take up much space on the countertop. Prep work is fast and it is great size for 2 people.  Quick for hard cooked eggs, too. Really came in handy today on the 4th of July!  üòÖü§£üòÇüëç This has made my life so easy .. I work alot of hours, when I don't prep for the week, it let's me make a super dinner in an hour ans I don't have to fuss with it What a mistake. You get what you pay for. excited about the opportunity to make yogurt, BUT.... the lid will not go back on once you take it off. It's such a terrible design. It took 1 hour to boil milk on the high saut√© setting and 2 hours to make rice on the rice setting. Additionally, when trying to make rice it kept showing ‚ÄúFood Burn‚Äù when the rice wasn‚Äôt even cooked. Save the headache and buy the Instant pot duo over the duo nova. I was very  unhappy with how it was boxed for delivery. Other than that it is good. The C6 error code comes up. The manual says ""pressure sensor"" problem. The instant pot has dual sensors. Searched high and low online and no replacement parts are found. Contacted customer service and submitted photos. Then no answer. Made contact again. Still no answer...... I have never owned or cooked with a pressure cooker, so I read the directions carefully and found them to be very helpful.  Having to turn off the warm button every time seems a little backward but otherwise my first meal of roast beef with potatoes and carrots was yummy.  Very easy to sear the meat in the instant pot using the saut√© setting, and same making the gravy afterward. bought this thinking it would be easier than stove top pressure cooker and it is not easier.Made chicken gumbo and kept getting food burn read out..manual says not enough liquid. Checked under lid and sure enough was beginning to burn on bottom. Thought that maybe roux was too thick but was not thick at all, actually a little more watery than usual..Sometimes newer is not better than older, unfortunately trashed box it came in so maybe can't return. Excellent as a pressure cooker to help shave cooking time of Vietnamese Pho broth from a 2 days to 1 day.Terrible job as a rice cooker.  I'm highly considering purchase a Tiger rice cooker separately. I completely understand that no kitchen appliances made to be dropped. With that in mind, I find it unfortunate when an appliance that is $80 gets dropped 10 inches from a counter onto a cutting board and breaks into like six pieces. I think that shows shoddy construction and lack of attention to detail and lack of metal pieces Easy to use once you read the instructions. Still I usually just hit pressure cool and enter the time and I'm done.I use it often to make beans (I soak them overnight but you can also make them dry). Takes about 25 minutes if you want them really soft. Also great for ""baked"" (well, steamed) potatoes. Just add a liittle water up to the included wire rack and add your washed or peeled potatoes. Done in 20-30 minutes depending on size of potatoes you use.Love the 6qt size also, perfect for tiny living as it is so versatile. Takes WAY less power than a conventional stove or oven and in a fraction of the time. Cleanup is easy too, the metal pot removes and the lid is submersible. The sealing ring takes a minute to figure out but once you've done it once its easy. Comes with an extra ring too, along with good instructions and a cooking guide. There is also an App but I haven't tried that yet.Highly Recommended! Love it makes great rice even brown and wild rice in 12 minutes. Mine started malfunctioning after 1 month. Very disappointed. Sent back... said it was new but it was already opened and items missing.  Box looked like it was dropped from a 5 story building. I really love my Instant Pot! I would have bought the Duo Evo Plus if I had realized that I needed to buy it to be able to steam with no pressure.  Even the low pressure option ruins rice in my opinion.  I tried all sorts of cooking options - more or less water, more or less time cooking.  I even tried pressure cooking for a short interval, followed by the slow cooker option.  Using the reduced amount of water that the manufacturer recommends causes the rice to be similar to puffed rice in some ways, a little like a rice cake.  And using a normal amount of water causes the rice to be overdone on the edges of each grain before the center of each grain gets fully cooked.  I can understand that some people like the pressure cooked rice, but I've come to the conclusion that high quality brown rice requires the absence of pressure. Really impressed. Great buy! The condensation collector was missing. There's nothing like making frozen chicken in 60 TO 90 minutes ! I love the way my roasts and stews, soupsand RECEIPES are cooked in less than half the time! I was so pleased with my Instant Pot that I bought one for my son and one for my granddaughter!!! I purchased this item back in December 2019, and it stopped working in February 2021. Would not recommend unless you have money to throw away. Like everyone AFTER Christmas, we're not hearing much about these things. BEFORE Christmas is was all the rage. I get it now. Very hard to clean. Who cares it's a bit faster. I bought it for my wife and I feel like I bought her a ball and chain So much nicer steam release process in this model  Glad to have upgraded! My wife was pleased with it. Loved the amount of things that can be prepared in this. Love that it takes less time than preparing it other methods for the most part and that it is so tender. I however do have a complaint about the vent. In non vent position it still splatters from time to time. I have done what instructions say do but still does this while in non vent position. I have three friends with insta pots. 2 of them same model as mine. All 4 pots splatter some while in non vent position and cooking. it made cooking a breeze and easy. It as make you more heathy than frying your foods. You can cook a veriaty of foods that will keep you healthy. A win , win for anybody. Only contained one seal (supposed to be two) and no condensate collector. It didnt hold up and seemed to stop working after about 3 weeks.  Amazon was great and took it back. Have mine for more than a yr. still work great, I use it almost everyday ü•ò I have owned this instant pot for over a year now and can give an honest review : it is a good machine to cook with and it does make quick work of many meals, it is however not easy to clean you must remove the rubber seal to clean the lid and after a year the metal bracket holding in the rubber seal is breaking at the spot welded legs.So we have a quality issue with longevity this is why i give it a 3 star review. We use this 3 or 4 times a week. Bought a 2nd inner pot due to so much use. I‚Äôve loved this Insta Pot, it really did make life easier, but it suddenly died, while it was in the midst of cooking. I bought it in October 2019 ‚Äî it hasn‚Äôt even lasted a full year.  An appliance should last more than 8 months.  Customer service sucks:  You have to open a ticket, then they ask for pictures.  Then they come back and ask for more pictures and proof of purchase.  You send everything they ask for.... then they ignore you.  I‚Äôm disgusted that Amazon still allows this company to sell through them, EVEN THOGUH THEY DO NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY!  They told me that they can‚Äôt send out my replacement due to COVID, BUT YET THEY ARE SHIPPING THEM OUT IF YOU BUY ON THIS AMAZON SITE.  I INFORMED AMAZON, THEY OBVIOUSLY DON‚ÄôT CARE. Not what I thought it was! And to big! I have used my Instapot 10 times and it has performed perfectly each time.  Rice and grains are just right.  The reason for a 4 star instead of a 5 star is, the programable face needs to be lit.  I cannot see the right button to push and have to tip the pot to the light or use the flashlight. Great product and easy to use! Gave as a gift It‚Äôs fine, it works well enough.  The thing that would have gotten it a 5-star rating would have been a spiral bound cookbook of all the basics.  Instead you have to download a cookbook & it just takes something away from the entire experience of having it and/or WANTING to use it.When it comes to cooking appliances an old fashion print cookbook makes all the difference in how much you‚Äôll like it. did not automatically go to warm setting after meal cooked missing items I bought 2 different size instant pot, came fairly quick. I‚Äôm trying to wipe off black stain from inner pot by adding a little oil and started it wipe,, wow,,,the stain continues to come out inside and outside of inner pot especially on the rim area. It‚Äôs black, dark black stain it never goes away. What is that anyway?  My arms about to fall off...I love instant pot, I would like to keep them only if I can get rid of that. If I made any food, it can‚Äôt be healthy to eat that stain along with it. Every time before pot ever pressurized first time using burn sensor light would come on. I gave up on it after multiple attempts and after reading all the manuals and watching videos. Never could get it to work. Be aware, I have been using the instant pot for long and it came with measuring cup and rice scooped. This time it does not have neither of them and the inner container does not even have the measuring lines. What‚Äôs wrong! For the five times I was able to use this, it worked fine and I was satisfied.  The sixth time it just quit.  Would not turn on at all.  I'm past the return period of course so I have put in a message to the manufacturer. When I sealed it during the Soup/broth, it didn't seal right because the steam still came out from the valve, leaking.How do I fix this issue? We purchased it carry around when we go for outing and cook the food whoever possible.It heats up fast and cooks faster. We have to be extra cautious on the setting else it will burn the food. It does burn our authentic indian food- briyani handful of times.overall, we are happy with the purchase. The one I got is: Smelly, dirty, must be in the warehouse for a long time!  It even has grease all over the outside shell of the cooker.  Very discussing!  Sorry to say that, but that one is not a new one.  Directly returned. I've been using this regularly for three years. I love it, however, food gets spilled in the inset where the lid sits, and it's really hard to clean in there. Also, it has stopped heating correctly. Hard boiled eggs used to take 6 minutes, is now taking over 10. Rice used to take 12 minutes, is now taking almost 20. I have an 8qt that I regret buying. It won't do rice or oatmeal or yogurt - i just get the burn error. I will get another duo80 though because it gets used a lot. My review will be long .  To begin with, this multi cooker is more of a marketing routine.  I had a very cheap one for a long time and I was so happy about it!  When it broke down I started to search the new multi cooker , I listened to my friends, who was obsessed  with this brand. I bought the first one which was terrible (It worked time after time). Then I returned and replaced it with this one, smaller and in a different style .  The food tastes awful!  Even rice should be different!(compared to my cheap one).  If I'm making soup, I can't let off steam to open the lid because the soup ‚Äúshoots out‚Äù from the steam outlet.  More than 20-30 minutes I cannot open the lid to eat.If I cook porridge and leave it.  (I will not turn it off immediately from the outlet) then it will burn.  What is this multi cooker for then?  This is for people who turned on and went for a walk.  when i come back i don‚Äôt want to see my porridge burnt, because i didn‚Äôt turn off the multi cooker. This is my second Instant Pot. Unfortunately, these newer models have a feature called ""Food Burn"". If the Instand Pot detects burnt food at the bottom of the pot, it will stop cooking and flash that dreaded ""Food burn"" warning. My old Instant Pot never had this problem, but the new one throws up this warning almost every time I cook. This renders the IP useless. The solution to Food burn? you have to pour the uncooked food into another container, clean the inside pot, scrub the burnt gunk off the bottom, pour the food back in, add more water, check the silicone ring, THEN start over. The whole point of an IP is so you don't have to think about the food. These new models are disappointing. Rather use a crockpot First thing on the menu was racknof ribs, wow, were they good...fakl off the bone in25 minutes! After a few uses the valve for steam on the top refused to seal - which means that the pot can't really be used.  I see that many other buyers report the same problem. I am very disappointed. This is amazing when it works. However, after using maybe 3-4 times/month, it's now completely dead. It doesn't turn on. I've checked my outlets and they work for all other items. I would like a replacement ASAP. THE FIRST ONE I RECEIVED, THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE BROKE THE FIRST TIME I PRESSED IT. SO I AM USING A REPLACEMENT. THE FIRST CON I HAVE WITH IT IS THAT THE INSTRUCTION BOOK THAT COMES WITH IT IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE. YES, IT IS HARD TO CLEAN. THE POT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A TIME SAVER BUT WHEN USED AS A PRESSURE COOKER, IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME TO CLEAN THAT IT ISN'T THAT MUCH OF A TIME SERVER. HOWEVER, WHEN USED AS A SLOW COOKER, IT IS EASY TO CLEAN.THE TOP IS FLIMSY. THE STEAM RELEASE KNOB COMES LOOSE WAY TO EASILY. MINE CAME OFF AND IT COULDN'T BE FOUND. A REPLACEMENT (WHICH IS HARD TO FIND BECAUSE IT ISN'T LISTED AS A PART ON THE INSTAPOT WEBSITE, COSTS $25.00 INCLUDING SHIPPING.THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN USED AS A PRESSURE COOKER, THE BOTTOM OF THE POT IS SO HOT IT TENDS TO BURN AND LEAVE A GLAZE THAT IS VERY HARD TO GET OFF. IT HELPS IF A MIXTURE OF WHITE VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA IS HEATED BUT EVEN THEN A LOT OF SCRUBBING IS REQUIRED.MANY RECIPES SUGGEST THAT MEATS BE SEARED USING THE SAUTE SETTING. MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT LEAVES A HARD TO REMOVE GLAZE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POT. THEREFORE, RATHER THAN BE FACED WITH A DIFFICULT CLEANING JOB, I USE A CERAMIC COATED FRYING PAN TO SEAR THE MEAT. IT DOES JUST AS GOOD, IF NOT A BETTER JOB OF SEARING THE MEAT AND THE PAN CAN BE WASHED CLEAN IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.I LIKE TO MAKE SOUPS AND STEWS AND THE SLOW COOKER ON THIS POT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB. HOWEVER, USING THE PRESSURE COOKER WILL GET THE JOB DONE MUCH FASTER, THE FLAVOR IS NOT SO GOOD. THE SAME IS TRUE WITH BEEF POT ROASTS. WHILE THE PRESSURE COOKER DOES A GOOD JOB OF GETTING THE MEAT TENDER, THE MEAT SEEMS TO LOSE MORE OF ITS JUICE. I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL RECIPES WHICH LEAVE A BASE ON THE BOTTOM FOR GRAVY BUT EVERYTIME IT BECOMES BURNED. I DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHEN I SLOW COOK.I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM SOMETIMES WITH THE VEGETABLES. THEY DON'T ALWAYS GET FULLY COOKED WITH THE PRESSURE COOKER WHILE COME OUT FINE WHEN SLOW COOKED.IF A QUICK MEAL IS NEEDED, PERHAPS THE PRESSURE COOKER IS THE WAY TO GO AND I HAVE FOUND SOME USES FOR THE PRESSURE COOKER WHEN COOKING VEGETABLES BY THEMSELVES. BUT BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG FOR THE PRESSURE COOKER TO HEAT UP, IT IS NOT AS FAST AS WE HOPE IT WILL BE. I HAVE HAD GOOD SUCCESS USING THE INSTANT POT AS A SLOW COOKER AND I LIKE THAT I CAN USE A GLASS TOP AND I CAN STIR THE CONTENTS FROM TIME TO TIME. Got a refurbished unit for a great price through Amazon Warehouse. The first unit failed the water boiling test, cycling on and off with a clicking noise every couple of seconds. Shame on Amazon for not testing it before shipping it to me, but the return through a Kohl's drop-off counter was easy.The second unit works perfectly. Both looked brand new and not perceptibly used, except for a little repackaging and wear on the outside box. I noticed a slight burning odor from the second unit, but it stopped after a couple of uses. (Other reviewers have noticed this, so I'm noting that it goes away.) One of the best investments that I‚Äôve made for my family. WE LOVE IT!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Works great. Today my instant pot died in the middle of making a pot of beans. I had to transfer the pinto beans to my old trusty, stove top pressure cooker. I used the instant pot almost every day. Three stars because it didn't last longer. Love it very easy to use üòäüòä Probably used around 15 times. More work than I thought. Directions were confusing and all of the add-ons just wasn‚Äôt worth it. For me. I know a bunch of people that love it. It just doesn‚Äôt work for me.Gave to my daughter. I read so many reviews before buying this ""3 quart"" Instapot.  People said in reviews it was perfect for a family of 2-3 ( but they did not say what they were cooking).Reality is that you can only fill it to 2/3, so 2 quarts.  So you cannot even take a pound of stew meat, a pound of onions, and then add the requisite 1-2 cups water to make gulash, you will be out of space!I had also hoped to take a lb of frozen hamburger to make an Instapot hamburger helper type meal in a pinch if I had forgotten to thaw meat, but *it won't fit* unless the meat is already thawed, which defeats my intended purpose.This might be great for rice or beans for two people, but I need something bigger to follow standard small recipes.It is cute-looking.Seve inches diameter on the bottom of the pot.  Much of the size is from the elements of the pot, not cooking space, which may be fine for one dude in a dorm room or  couple in a trailer pseudo-camping, but not for me. Waste of space.  Nuisance to clean.  No quicker than stove top or oven.  Gave it to a friend who loves hers and wanted a smaller one."

It stopped working after 1 week which is why I gave it a poor ranking. My be a battery but should have lasted longer. May dispute on credit card as I waited more than 30 days. I bought this on sale just as a placeholder to see if I like wearing a mechanical watch. I wore it a year straight before this review.My number one issue with this watch is the indices are green instead of white and on top of that, the lume is completely non functional. I would much rather the indices just be painted white. I got rid of the bracelet immediately, very uncomfortable for my wrist even though it looked very nice with the polished and matte areas. I put it on a high quality NATO.The accuracy out the box was excellent holding for days dead on, or going a little fast. A year later and it's not that way anymore whatsoever. Its accuracy has quickly declined to being slower and slower. Which is normal. I just expected that to happen less soon.The date adjust has stopped working. I never set it during the ""danger zone"" of between 9 and midnight. I have to set the time forward to advance the date.Big positive is that the case is finished nicely and it is a good fashion watch. From a distance people just see a vaguely shiny watch that really looks like something. It really is great for a low budget fake it til you make it. accessory. I haven't tested the water or scratch resistance but it is a very nice watch. I would hate given it 5 * but for the fact that the crown is very difficult to screw in. Looks the part but poor quality broke within 6 months. Bought a Casio divers watch after this and have had no trouble. the watch is losing a minute every day I have to adjust the time every week.need from the company to test the product before shipment Have been very happy with my new watch ,well made keep time real well ,as good as  a COCS watch. Three times in the last 3 weeks that I have had this watch, it either ran slow or stopped completely.  This behavior is so unlike an Invicta watch. I loved I bought a new wath invicta and I received a very used watch in bad conditions it has scrash on the mirror and scrash on the purseI feel very upset in this purchase I bought this for my son. He's not using it now because the battery has died already and most jewelry stores won't work on them without a fee or because of liability if they break it.Seems like a watch you buy should be working for well over a year... Better than what I thought it would be for the price it's a little on the heavy side but that is to be expected because it is an automatic watch but it's not heavier than my Seiko 5 I prefer this Invicta over my Seiko 5 Good we Very nice watch. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I didn‚Äôt like the band. Band feels low quality. Much more accurate than my similar type Seikos that cost over $100.  I hope it lasts. Solid cheap watch. I couldn‚Äôt get link pins punched out so I had to go to a jeweler to get it fit so add $7 bucks to the actual cost. Power reserve only makes it through a little over a day of not being worn. For the price this watch ticks all the boxes.Keeps good time and looks really good on my wrist.If I have one small niggle its the strap feels a bit cheap and the clasp a bit difficult to open and close . I'm sick and tired of the price after the spell. After wearing for only 3 weeks the watch seems to be coming apart inside - it sounds like loose parts when you move the watch. Junk. I would never recommend buying an Invicta. I should have gone with the Seiko 5 automatic. Looks great feels great yes its a bit of a knock off but its a Seiko movement for under a hundred! Wish mine didn‚Äôt run faaassstttt even after taking it to a shop. By the end of the day from setting the watch it‚Äôs already running 5-8 mins fast I don‚Äôt dive with it and as long as you‚Äôre wearing it out and adjust it every time. It does fine My biggest mistake was not saving the box to return it.  I have approximately 10 watches I hardly wore this one. Wore 2 or 3 times the winding part came of it broke the watch is not working. I like this watch it looks nice but it's very heavy, so heavy I don't bother actually wearing it anymore, but I don't regret purchasing it. I'm not able to wear it for long periods of time as it hits a nerve in my wrist and numbs my hand, I still do like the watch though in spite of this. Its solid and seems to be of good quality. It's good value especially if you can get it in sale like I did. Mine has great accuracy and I can take it to the beach which I think that it's cool and convenient to check time in the ocean. But, and here is a BIG ""but"", it does not have lume (which feels lame) and you will feel like a fraud and hope that no rich person ask you ""Hey, is that a Rolex"", and you will also feel that you should have just spent an extra 100 bucks or 2 and just gotten an Orient Ray or Seiko 5KX, because you will begin to notice that although this is a great value watch, it does have subtle flaws, like not so great finish and misaligned bezel.Do I recommend this watch? Yeah, I recommend this watch, if you truly cannot or will not fork out the extra $100 or 2 for a Seiko, Orient or Citizen.  This watch would serve you really good regardless.. The Invicta Pro Diver is a very handsome and well-made watch. However, I have a problem with the crown. According to the manual, this watch should have 3 crown positions: winding, date-adjust, and hour/minute-adjust. My watch doesn't have the date-adjust position, meaning that I have to set the date by advancing the hour/minute forward or backward, which was terrifyingly cumbersome when I first use it. It didn't significantly take away my enjoyment of the watch, but it is a disappointing inconsistency. Liked After 30 days water got into the sealed face. My Invicta 8926OB arrived on time and was well packaged in a yellow cardboard box. It has the yellow winder weight visible in the back crystal. There is no indication of where it was made, although it says it was designed in the USA, and it has NH35A and 24 jewels the on the winder weight which I understands a Japanese movement.  I have showered with it daily and there has been no indication of moisture intrusion,  The reason that I rated 3 stars instead of 5 stars is it looses 12 to 15 seconds per day when compared to the NIST US time website, which is much worse than indicated in other reviews.  I have since purchased an INVICTA 22047SYB quartz which is identical in appearance to the 8926OB and seems to keep perfect time. It also has the screw down crown like the 8926OB and is much more accurate. I understand the automatic 8926OB automatic would not be expected as accurate as the quartz, but loosing 15 seconds per day is unacceptable. I am considering returning it, in hopes of  getting one that is more accurate. No what I was looking to small I was hoping it would be a 44mm üëçüèª Looks wise it's nice, feels nice but accuracy is terrible, it's now a day late and several hours behind. Would not buy Invincta again. So, this has been both my favorite and most frustrating watch. From the start (Nov, 2017) it would lose a couple minutes each week.  By the time I finally gave up on it, it would lose 5 minutes every couple of days. I suppose people could say that Invicta recommends sending the watch in annually for maintenance.....no thanks. Not willing to spend the original price of the watch in shipping costs over the 3 years of the warranty to keep it running. Maybe once I got past the $200 range I would consider it.Ok, that being said, this watch is very nice to look at and I received compliments on it often. I use the rotating bezel multiple times a day for things like timing laundry or things on the stove. Unfortunately the bezel stopped working correctly a few months ago. I did consider sending it in for repair at that point, but decided with the time issue i'd just wait and buy a new one later.The body of the watch is actual stainless steel which is nice because the 3 previous watches I owned would all corrode due to my skin acidity over time. If I could change on thing on these watches it would be the magnifying window for the date. Scratches too easily thus obscuring the date. No real need for it, honestly.In the end, I ended up buying the similar Model 30018 as a replacement, and hope the quartz version will be accurate or it'll be going back. I returned it because it was way to small for my taste, and it looked like a woman's watch on my wrist. I don't have a large wide wrist by any means. I would say I have an average wrist. The bracelet feel cheap Not worth the $80 bucks. Within 6 weeks of wearing it the crystal cracked, actually looks more like glass than crystal. The watch now leaks and is pretty much useless. I did not try the water and scratch resistence. Like this watch so much we give them away as gifts! Good value for a Seiko movement. Too much Invicta branding. Function are smooth. Personally I plan to take this completely apart and mod with custom parts, great foundation for that. I gave this to my husband for Christmas in 2014.  He likes the look and feel of this watch, but it doesn't keep perfect time.  It was fine for about the first year, but after that it began slowing down.  He is constantly having to reset the time.  He reset it about 24 hours ago, and it's already 2 minutes behind today. It is not on time Excellent watch for the money I placed an order for the watch based on the good reviews and the cheap price. I received the watch and noticed the crown wouldn't screw down as described in the product description so I put in a order for a replacement. To my surprise the crown wouldn't screw down on the replacement watch either. I'm not really one to write reviews but if anyone is expecting a fully water proof screw down crown, look else whether. This watch in fact does not have a screw down crown. But the watch is a good watch, stylish and durable. If you aren't concerned with water proof watches I say buy it. Size of face of watch too small, looked small on my wrist. The automatic doesnt works, every day i have to fix the hour every now and then, although is a pretty goodlooking watch. Pros-Excellent value.  Love the accurate Seiko  movement.Cons: Tight bezel with an in/out  slight wiggle with pip at 12I don't expect any bezel problems, water or scratches. Watch is sharp, I did expect a larger face for my husband; it is semi difficult to set and easy to accidentally mess up the times and date if not screwed back in properly. Otherwise it was a nice gift plus it‚Äôs water resistant; you don‚Äôt have to worry about it getting a little wet. Keeps pretty good time . took Two links out to fit. Not hard to do. I bought this because I got tired of putting batteries in watches and they would go dead at the most inopportune time. It's everything I have hoped it would be. Unfortunately, pin on watchband fell out and I have returned the item to Amazon. I really loved the watch and have another 8928 that works fine.  Sadly, these things happen, but, Amazon is issuing a full refund upon delivery of the item. It‚Äôs okay. The movement is fine and reliable as that part is from seiko. The watch itself is very cheap. The bracket rattles like crazy. It is very light. It scratches easily. The steel is very cheap and is like something you find in a piece of jewelry in $.75 toy machine at a kids pizza place. One thing you also need to remember is that this is the LEAST respected watch in existence and most people who know anything about watches won‚Äôt even spit in the direction of this watch. Do not add this to a collection but rather just buy it if you want a super cheap dress watch that you don‚Äôt have to care about. I ordered this watch from Amazon roughly 6 months ago and was intially extremely pleased.  It looks tremendous for the price- any of your friends who aren't well-versed in watches will be impressed.  It keeps relatively good time- once again, a bit more than you would expect for <$100.  Unfortunately though, about a month ago the watch lost the ability to engage the date function.  It's absolutely impossible to change the date.  Pretty darn annoying.  However, the watch still looks nice and I occassionaly get compliments when I'm daft enough to wear it.  So overall, it looks fairly nice and keeps relatively good time, but if you're looking for performance/durability, avoid invicta.  If you're looking for an attractive diver on a budget, the orient mako is absolutely worth checking out. If you don't wear it all the time, it stops running. Quite heavy! Do not order from here, it was a fake Invicta watch when I opened the box, very mad ...bezel was almost impossible to move.  Sent it back and bought the Swiss version 9937OB‚Ä¶no sticky bezel; same great look. Does not keep the time at all. You get what you pay for. This is no more than a ""beater"" class watch. Quality control is not good, mine arrived with a slanted date window and very, very stiff bezel. The watch looks cheap and unimpressive, which considering the claimed rrp or the selling price for that matter isn't good enough. The NH35A movement gains at least 15 seconds a day and this movement is supposed to be quite good if you read up! A great shame as overall with a little more attention to detail and less penny pinching this could have been a decent watch. Now if you want this as a beater, then go for it! It‚Äôs not working working properly I cannot set the time and I don‚Äôt know why now I have to spend more money defined out why I‚Äôm very unsatisfied with that one Watch came broken and looks used. Would think twice before buying I have had this watch for over one year and it is one of the best homage watches on the market. It keeps time well (it runs a little fast maybe a couple minutes/day which I feel is acceptable).  For the price it is a great watch, hence the 5 star rating. It has zero scratches on it and looks like it just came new out of the box...after over a year of everyday use. I've had lots of compliments on the watch some people ask me if it's a rolex because they see the sweeping second hand that runs very smooth. 25 jewel movement is excellent.Cons:Clasp is a little tight.Hard to fit the wristband (it didn't come with a tool).I am not a big fan of the invicta engraving on the side of the bezel. I own about 10 watches, and this is my favorite. I'm obviously not a high roller, but this watch looks fantastic and has a nice build quality. No good. Dont buy this one. Had to buy another one. The watch started speeding, it gave me the wrong time by 30 minutes ahead of the actual time. Had to buy another watch. Less than a month old, bit of a knock on the kitchen bench and its in the bin. Spend the extra and get something with a sapphire crystal instead of the cheap brittle glass. Nice watch for the money, good looking, however way to small in diameter for a big hand.. Quality Watch - excellent construction - Looks Great. Bought another generic watch - and it wasn‚Äôt good quality - so I returned it and got this one,This one is worth the extra money - it‚Äôs VERY Well Made and it‚Äôs steps above this generic look alike brands in quality. I like the big numbers nice watch,well made..but not happy because it did not come with a bill of sale for warrenty...shipped in paper bag....not good The watch keeps great time and I do like the way it looks. I am giving 2 stars because the Invicta symbol and Invicta name is so crooked on the watch dial that I have no idea how it made it past QA. Maybe the watch I have did not go through QA? Nice watch, but I bought this thinking it would be larger, it's 40mm diameter and is awfully small looking on my 8.5"" circumference wrist.  It looked fine on my 5'7"" wife's wrist though.  (This watch is only 2mm wider than the Invicta Ladies Diver watches, which are 38mm.)I sent it back and bought a different 43mm (not including crown) Invicta Pro Diver, and I would prefer that to be slightly larger, although it's a really good fit.  Large face watches are more in style nowadays anyway.One other thing... some people are getting this watch with the new NH35A movement, which has some really nice new features (hacking & manual winding)  The one I received however came with the older NH25A movement. To begin with, this is an obvious homage to the Rolex Submariner, however you‚Äôll notice many differences if you look closely. Overall, it looks stunning, feels solid on the wrist and features a very reliable and accurate movement (NH35A). My only complaints are the crown being a little hard to unscrew and the lume paint having been poorly applied on the triangle mark. It‚Äôs on sale very often, which means you can get it for only 60$. You have to be very careful when you use the stem to set the watch. It is very hard to screw the stem back in. If you don't play around with it, and keep trying to get it just right it will strip the threads on the stem. I'm very very careful screwing in the stem. I have friends who also have the same problem. At least two of my friends and my son have striped stems on there watches . Great looking watch, but the link where it snaps together broke after three months.  Unfortunately, that is not covered by the warranty.  You get what you pay for. Bought this 2 years ago as a short time replacement  for my ""nicex "" watch while being serviced, every 20 yrs....took it off the watch winder, set it and it loses about .7~10 minutes a day...kind of an estimate of time, close to wearing a sundial, pretty much worthless.....don't plan a coordinated operation with this POS!ON EDIT....TOTAL POS LOSES 15 MINUTES A DAY AND WONT RUN FOR A DAY WITHOUT WINDING!!!!!!!!!!!On editNow it loses 30 min a day! Very large band. Had to remove to links. The watch really IS beautiful, looks just like Rolex submariner. BUT the date magnify bubble was CROOKED Over the date and when taking out links to adjust I found that the holes where the pin goes were so cheaply made that I could barely put the watch back together! An hour later and mix and matching a few links and it went back.  I'm sure any order for the same watch might be okay but hits hit or miss with these watches. I have another invitation speedway off amazon that after on a few times wearing it I got condensation under the crystal that wouldn't go away. They are cheap replicas of nicely designed watches. You are paying for style not function or quality here. But they have style down pat. I measured the watch and it is 37mm not 40mm as it should be. Build quality and functionality Nice looking watch. Should have paid attention to the reviews. The Mayans could keep track of  time following the Stars than this time piece. Came out of the box not being able to track a day.  Time wasn't plus or minus 15 seconds a month it was 15- 20 minutes a day. And multiple other issues. But like I said very nice feel and look to it... Good Luck! Looks well made fits nice,just started buying Invicta so I can t give an honest review. My buddy loved it. Solid for any collection Looking at some of the reviews here has me laughing a little.  This watch, in my opinion, does not have a quality feel to it. The bracelet is rather lightweight and cheap and rattles.  Same for the clasp, very thin and light.  The crown feels coarse as you turn it.  The dial and hands do look fairly nice.  The watch itself, sans bracelet, is heavy, which some people correlate with quality, apparently.  Back to some of the comments in other reviews, you know, ""I have 32 expensive watches and this is far better than any of them"" or ""it's darn near as good as a rolex"" (no, it isn't), are just hard to fathom.  I'm no watch snob (my daily beater is an LL Bean watch) but I own an older Rolex so have some experience as to how a quality watch looks and feels and find it hard to believe that anyone would ever mistake this for anything other than the cheap watch it is. I love Invicta, but the last couple divers watches had issues.  1st one lost time, 2nd one got moisture from sweating on a hot day while golfing...never wore it in the water, shower or hot tub....pretty pathetic for a diver's watch.  But the price is right. The watch looks great and the movement is very smooth. However, it doesn't keep time well. After a full wind and wearing it every day, it gains about a 1-2 minutes a week. I would give it 5 stars if it kept time. Thats the whole purpose of a watch... Piece of crap, second hand stopped at 20 after after tapping it several times starting running only to stop at 20 after. After several tries it stopped at 20 after and never restarted. Don't waste your money, I give it -5 stars Looks amazing but unfortunately is not covered by Invicta's full 3 year when purchased on amazon also if there is any defect you are covered for 1 year however requires you to pay USD $128.99 per watch non-refundable for them to fix it even if brand new and repairs are even more if required meaning defective parts deemed by misuse plus the return shipping it would be cheaper to buy a new watch than spend the price of the watch to get it fixed. Another thing be advised this watch takes about a month to get into the movement of things so you may lose a few minutes every day for a month but of this keeps happening it may need to be serviced also be aware this watch has no reserve power meaning if not on your wrist will stop running really quickly as it is one of Seiko‚Äôs simple yet efficient movements purchase by Invicta keeps time but needs a winding box don‚Äôt fall for Invicta saying a bunch of technical B.S that it has some defect they can fix it. This one can‚Äôt hold charge longer than 24 hours you will lose time by around 2 minutes different by each one."
45,"Iron Flask Sports Water Bottle - 40 Oz, 3 Lids (Straw Lid),Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel, Modern Double Walled, Simple Thermo Mug, Hydro Metal Canteen",Sports and Outdoors,"I like the fact it came with extra tops Has to remain upright or will leak all over This leaks through the straw cap. Really annoying because it‚Äôs so big it doesn‚Äôt fit in a cup holder. So I found out it leaked by it leaking all over my car seat. That was fun. I've never purchased any water bottles like these except hydroflask. I decided to try this because it's half the price and I'm so glad I did.  It came with three types of lids, including a drinking straw lid that hydroflask sells separately for $10. This bottle is just as good in every way and will be my new go to. Great water bottle! Keeps water cold all day and no leaks. Very easy to clean. Loved this for the first three months until I discovered the plastic lid is breaking down with small pieces falling into the drink.  Love knowing I've ingested this now.  Obviously will never buy again. My girls loved their bottles (got 2). Unfortunately when they would turn on their side when in their bags they would leak from the lid. I keep ending up with bags full of water. Not idea. I wish they were more secure! Nice I was looking for a big water bottle to keep my water cold all day since I work outside. I‚Äôve had one in the past that would keep water so cold that there was still ice for after 2 whole days (like if I accidentally left it in the car). Not remembering what brand it was, I bought this one due to the size and reviews I read. I‚Äôm lucky if I get 2 hours of ice with this. I‚Äôve had it for over a month and use it every single day. But I know what to expect. Room temp water that I constantly have to add ice to."
46,"Lasko 2511 36‚Äù Oscillating 3-Speed Tower Remote Control Household Fans, 36 Inch, Black",Home and Kitchen,"An Irritatingly loud whining fan. Irritating because a regular prop fan is much quieter than this, blows just as well, and costs less money. No one can sleep when this thing in on in the bedroom. It‚Äôs like someone is running a hairdryer on low or a neighbor is using their electric leaf blower outside. We can‚Äôt hear the clock radio in the morning if it‚Äôs on and I‚Äôve been missing all the quality morning radio talk with this heatwave. Also - Very cheap plasticky buttons. If you enjoy the feel of ABS plastic harshly striking against ABS plastic - you will love these buttons. I can hear the buttons clicking from downstairs; you‚Äôll never be able to secretly turn this fan on. And the remote doesn‚Äôt come with batteries. Anyway I‚Äôm as much of a cheapskate as the next guy, but this thing wasn‚Äôt that cheap. Why didn‚Äôt I just by a used prop fan from 1989 for 15 bucks on Craigslist? I don‚Äôt know. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. It's really loud to me; I wanted to have a fan while I record Live Facebook but you can hear it in the background so I am not able to use it. If that doesn't matter to you, then it's a good fan for you. The remote has to also be right in front of the fan unlike a TV remote. Again, hard if you are trying to turn it on and off as you are recording a video. lol. But I do like the settings and the option for it to turn. Love everything about this fan and it works perfectly! The remote makes it extra amazing! Don‚Äôt buy this fan it doesn‚Äôt  put out any air that will cool you down and it‚Äôs loud Got it for a room without air conditioning and it‚Äôs really nice when I want to cool down or if the room is stuffy. I love the sleep mode/timer. Dleep mode is handy, as well as remote. Very quiet and not very powerful. We live in the Mojave Desert so use a fan a lot! We have ceiling fans in most of the rooms but still find a floor model essential. We bought this one to replace another Lasko fan which we‚Äôd had for years that quit oscillating.  We‚Äôve kept it in case we need another one and frankly they‚Äôre both running right now! We liked our other Lasko fan and this one is working beautifully, too! I have been super pleased with my fan. The remote works really well and it is quiet. I've been able to set my AC temperature higher because of how effectively this cools me wherever I need to in the house. A+ It‚Äôs keeps me fresh but it‚Äôs not cold Buy three or four, you'll be glad you did. The fan was working great, up until it just stopped.  Now it's a usesless oblong taking up space in the living room. Love that it comes with remote. The fan has been great at night. I live by the ocean, so it‚Äôs never too hot, but my apt gets stuffy and warm at night and this fan does the trick. Yes, it makes noise, but not to the point of keeping me awake. It‚Äôs more like white noise to fall asleep to. But the remote sucks. I bought it specifically for the remote, to be able to turn off/on at night from bed and it requires pushing the button 15 times before it might do something. And yes, this is with brand new batteries Very convenient noise level is minimal use in the bedroom for nighttime air for sleeping. Very good value for the money. It‚Äôs being returned. It‚Äôs defective. It has 3 speeds for air flow. 2 of the 3 speeds don‚Äôt work. i wish it blew off more air Gets the job done but not very strong! Quiet tho Even on its highest setting, it barely blows. It really just moves air but not enough to cool you off If you are looking for a fan that has enough output of cool air that you can feel it when it is on - then keep looking.Pros: sleek, remote control, and very quietCons: weak in air outputEven on the highest setting you can barely feel any air coming out of this thing. I love how quiet it is, but there is essentially no difference from when the fan is off or on.I am looking for another brand to purchase.Do NOT recommend this brand. Honesty I aspected something bigger for the price it‚Äôs small I had to put a stool underneath noise level is loud I cape yes better item I really like this fan, the air output is very good, and the size is nice if you use it in an open space.  If you use for sleeping it would be a good idea to prop up on a foot stool.  The only issue I have is that the base is a bit wobly and isn't sturdy.  I don't know if that is normal or if I just received a defective one. I have a larger one made by same company that I love.  Bought this one for smaller space but it doesn‚Äôt work very well. I‚Äôm  Disappointed in it The fan is very poor. You might as well go to the top level to even notice its on I would give this fan 5 stars because it was super simple to put together and the remote feature is awesome it oscillates the 1 and only complaint I have is the fan speed to me the highest speed doesn't push as much as air as I would like but still good all around fan especially for the price. Noise level is great I like it. It‚Äôs a fan so there‚Äôs not too much more to say. Would purchase another for my living room if needed. I love that it has a shut-off timer and remote. It‚Äôs currently in my bedroom and it‚Äôs quiet that I don‚Äôt have an issue with the sound. This product worked for about 6 days and then stopped working. Seems to be the motor is bad. Idk but I wouldn't risk wasting the money on it. I like everything. Fan works perfect. it's awesome for the price I love the  shape it‚Äôs sleek and the white color is clean looking. This fan doesn‚Äôt take away from room decor at all!! The noise level was real quite at first it increased a little after use,but nothing that would disturb your sleep at night! All in all Im very happy I bought this model.!!!!!! I like a fan for white noise and cooling me off. This thing BARELY has a speed at all. Setting 3 is slower than my setting 1 on my box fan. The air flow is very low, even when it's on high, wouldn't buy another. Pretty sleek good looking design decent breeze is not quite as strong as a pedestal fan but not the worst either This is a nice fan buuut it makes a horrible scraping noise when it oscillates. We purchased only 2 months ago.  Cannot recommend. I purchased this fan because of the advertising. I have the fan speed on three and I am still hot. looks great but doesn't do what it is advertised to do! not a great fan do not waste your money. Very disappointed. The fan comes with a remote which has the same functions that can be controlled from the fan's control panel. Very easy to assemble and it can be placed literally anywhere in the room. The speed can be adjusted from 1 (min) to 3 (max). It typically starts on the last used setting, meaning if the user selected speed 1 and turned the fan off, next time it is turned on, the speed will be 1. No complains really, just that for the purposes of listening to music, I wish the noise from the fan was slightly lower. I am rarely compelled to comment on Amazon purchases, but I am now on my second fan that has devolved within 2 weeks to making rattling, noisy squeaks related to the blades and oscillation. The first one I thought was defective but the replacement just had a different issue within the same time period. I‚Äôve given up expecting these to hold up even for a month. If you can tolerate some unpleasant but relatively quiet, repetitive mechanical noise, it does the job serviceably. Came a day early and the package was beat up a bit (mishandling). Opened up the package and the fan was fully assembled with the remote taped to its side. There was many parts of a label (probably a return label) all over the one side. Was able to remove all of it with ""Goo Gone"". Plugged in the unit, it's quiet, and all functions seem to work fine. Its power band is a bit weaker then the 42"" Lasko it replaced but is still powerful enough to suit me. Very plain design but that's Lasko for you. Unit cleaned up well with the Goo Gone... and we'll have to see how long this unit lasts. Honestly a really bad fan that doesn‚Äôt change the speeds, they all feel the same. Amazon gave me a hard time with returning so now it just sits in a corner‚Ä¶ Fan works well, moves lots of air. It's just not as quiet as I thought it would be. So far so good! It's really quiet (noise level), which I was worried about being that we use it in the bedroom. Works great. We liked it so much we bought another for my parents & they are loving it also. Real good for the price. No remote. Base is TINY compared to the picture. Falls over. Does not stand on it's own.. waste of money. Scammers. The color is more gray than white! Works fine but not as powerful or cooling as I thought The remote is a nice touch. After that...It really doesn't blow that much air. It doesn't help with feeling cooler, unless you're literally in front of it not more than 2-3 feet away, and that's on power level three. Possibly one of the worst purchases I could have made. My laptop cooler pad blows out as much air as this, and that's not a lot. QuietWorks wellFits into environment Fan is great but does not oscillate far. Maybe does a 3"" turn. I have had this fan for just over a month.  Today,  all of a sudden,  the motor is making a loud noise.  Very annoying.  You would expect it to work longer than a month for what it costs. A great fan! Cools the entire room and it's quiet! Would buy again! Very low output even on highest setting Unfortunately arrived broken. It works a great noise maker, rattles and shakes. I think some parts inside went loose during delivery. Amazon offered, replacement or refund, but I decided not to return, because it was tough to unpack, and didn't want to pack it again and carry to the post office. No more fans online for me. There's a definite buzz with this, which made it hard to sleep. The air is stirred, and felt cooler, but needed 2 more for the whole room. The speed levels could be higher more air being blown out Blows hard and quiet! This fan is solid. I had one for my so s too. And then got a second one for the office. Customer service is also amazing as I got one that was DOA and they sent a new one without delay to make sure they were taking care of me! Great fan. Highly recommend. This fan does the job. Love that it comes with a remote. I have purchased this same fan in white for another bedroom, and the black for the living room. Just about everything this fan does it does well, but holy moly it is LOUD. Even on the lowest setting it kept me up. If you need louder white noise, it‚Äôll be perfect for you, but if you just like airflow and prefer a quieter sleep space, look elsewhere. Kept the fan for my workout space because it‚Äôs a good fan otherwise! Only had this fan for a month and it‚Äôs makes a loud creaking noise. Too much of a pain to return plus I‚Äôm just outside of my return window. Save yourself the frustration and money and buy the $20 Walmart mainstay tower fan. SO much better Would've been the perfect fan if it went all the way from left to right but you only get a 45 degree wedge directly in front of the fan. Great for side of the bed but not in a garden. Nice sound for sleeping. Vertical and oscillation feaure make for a nice, even distribution of air flow. Great space saving fan...  Tall and mighty! (And pretty darn quiet.) I've liked the Lasko stand heaters for several years now, and this fan is also a quality product. Great, easy controls. It does not do more than like a 60‚Ä¢ turn.  The cooling is okay but it‚Äôs not strong enough. Not worth the price. Should have bought the 20 dollar one. I never received screws nor remote with the product. Product as shown. No need for pictures. Not so happy right now. It does not blow as good as the previous one that I had purchased. Returning? Waste of my timeKeeping it for the kitchen area so when I cook I don‚Äôt overheatDisappointed with airflow even at its highest number. I have a few around the house. Very quiet ...sturdy.. Max four hour timer..does not take up much room. I also have lasko.space heaters. Same style and features. I would only buy lasko. Been the most reliable in this price range. There are only like 2 speeds and that‚Äôs being nice. The scorns one is like it‚Äôs just trying a little harder. It‚Äôs works ok. But defiantly should work better for its price. Cheaply made for the price. Not sure how long it will last! Weak. This fan makes a weird rattling noise, as described in other reviews, which does not go away. I thought the fan I received was defective, so I ordered a replacement. The new one also made this noise so I ended up returning it and buying a different brand. Worst fan ever So this fan has 3 levels all levels feel the same. My 16 dollar fan blows harder and stronger than the almost 50 bucks fan smh Not as powerful as I thought it would be, but not bad at all. Everything worked as it should. There is a problem with the installation This fan really moves the air.  It is very quite. Functional remote, great fan speeds! Could be lighter on noise level but it is working well and keeping up mostly cool wish It was a little taller Awesome fan! Cool air, nice and strong. Very quiet. giving it a lower rating because after a short time it is quite noisy This product is nice, but when a room gets warm, it only blows the warm air around. The air does not blow cold. If that makes sense. Fan perfect for my needs. Product is a little noisy when using in the bedroom while sleeping. Love the size and look of this fan. Also outs out good air flow. However if you want to use it for ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù while sleeping I do not recommend. It has funny clicks and ticks that come and go while it‚Äôs running. Got this in June to replace an old Lasco fan. We turn our fans on the slowest setting to move air while sleeping but also as white noise. When we turned this fan on low it sounded like it was struggling to run. It started out ok but then dramatically dropped speed. About five minutes later it starts increasing speed an then seems to work ok. We kept it thinking it might get better as we use it and just come on to the correct speed, but it hasn‚Äôt. It still, speeds up, dramatically slows like it is going to stop and about five minutes into running it picks up and goes to the speed it‚Äôs supposed too. Not sure what to do, because when it does get to speed we like it. This didn't have the power I was looking for.  On highest speed 3 it wasn't reaching very far. Noise level perfect but not strong in throwing air as assume. Fan is good but the oscillation motor is loud and sounds like it grinds."
47,"Lenovo Chromebook Flex 3 11"" Laptop, 11.6-Inch HD (1366 x 768) IPS Display, MediaTek MT8173C Processor, 4GB LPDDR3, 64 GB eMMC, Chrome OS, 82HG0006US, Blizzard White",Computers,"Got the Chromebook and was looking forward to seamless Google and Android user experience. Well, hardly any of my normal and favorite apps, from the Google Play Store, that I use on my Google Android will even run on this Chromebook!  I don't know if it's because it's Lenovo, or the Chrome OS, or Google, or what.  Anyway, it's VERY disappointing that most Apps I try to load from the Google Play Store DON'T load or run on this Lenovo Chromebook. The laptop seems pretty solid, but the screen doesn't get super bright and the keyboard is not that great (not very crisp, keys don't cleanly depress), and is totally different than the Lenovo Thinkpad's awesome keypad. Lastly, they should have added a backlit keyboard light to it. Would have been nice. However, the battery life is really good. It's a good laptop for internet browsing, Google docs, sheets, Gmail, etc.. And you don't have to deal with the ridiculous Microsoft Windows OS. But you just can't use your favorite Apps, which stinks! üëéüò° I have had this chromebook for 2 months and now the charger doesn't work! I really liked the chromebook but now I have a bad charger.... This is the closest thing I've seen to the perfect Chromebook. It's fast, the touchscreen works well, there's plenty of local storage (32 and 64GB versions exist -- I went for the 64GB model) if you want it, and the battery life just goes on and on. This is the first laptop I've owned that goes for days between charges with usage time of a few hours per day. You can even use it as a tablet if you want to: just flip the screen around and there you are!I have a few Intel Celeron-based Chromebooks of similar age from competing manufacturers and this thing handily outperforms all of them.A few releases of Chrome OS (around the version 76-80 mark, and again sometime around beta versions 87/89 when the kernel was upgraded to version 4.19) demonstrated buggy behavior on this platform, but that seems to be all gone now.If you're buying this today, you'll want to be mindful of Google's automatic updates expiration policy, which is set in mid-2025 for this model. (It'll be here sooner than you think!) You can still use the Chromebook after that time, though you will not get any further software updates. Intel and AMD-based Chromebook models can sometimes be made to run other operating systems. Hopefully someone will do the same for ARM based models such as this Lenovo C330. I can definitely see myself still using this after 2025, if the battery and SSD hold out, and I'm fairly sure both will.There's really only thing I've ever found lacking from the Lenovo C330, and that's a backlit keyboard. Had Lenovo equipped it with one, this truly would have been the perfect Chromebook. The operating system is extremely buggy, the screen and resolution are smaller and worse than you would imagine.Has crashed more than once.  I do not recommend this product. This Chromebook is a moderate performer, but is plenty good enough for what I do. My problem is that a 2"" crack has recently appeared in the case top (behind the screen) and it is just out of warranty: 1 year + 1 month old.The case has a certain amount of flexing when being opened or closed, so I suppose that's what did it. Thing is, I have never forced it or handled it roughly in any way, just normal use. still learning how google id different than Win10, but enjoying the experience. Love everything about this computer EXCEPT that the spacebar doesn‚Äôt respond well when you press it.  You have to press it hard to make it work.  You eventually get used to it, but it‚Äôs a pain at first, especially when typing a paper up.  My favorite thing about the computer is the battery has a very long life!  I also like that the screen completely folds back and forth, very handy, as well as the touch screen.11/18/20 - UPDATE - as much as we loved this chromebook, the screen no longer turns on...happened about 6 months after the warranty (1 year) expired.  I changed my review to 3 stars because it served its purpose well for about 1.5 years before dying.  For that kind of money, I really can‚Äôt complain too much I guess. I love how I can bend the screen but the camera is HORRIBLE!! It's automatically zoomed in and is the worst quality. The touch screen doesn't always work which sucks bc now I'm stuck with a ""laptop"" that bends  but can't take pics and it doesnt have a CD slot which I thought it did üò´üò´.On the bright side. It is pretty fast and compact Very sensitive a pad. Impossible to use. Have to get the mouse to work with this laptop... it's a nice little laptop, especially for school, but Simmers beware! I just bought Sims 4 on my previous laptop but had to get a new one. Chromebook does not support any Origin games because you cannot download Origin on their operating system. SO- There goes the money I spent on the game because my previous laptop is being given to my little sister and I want her to have the game but I wish I could also play it. You can get a refund on the Sims game, though, if you want to make the sacrifice.Update- Also does not support Online Pearson (Revel). Now I'm looking for a new laptop. So far so good The screen is a little small. It's okay for email, fantasy football and looking stuff up.  Not easy to convert docs from Google to word. Not very user friendly, settings disappear and I‚Äôve had to reset twice already, which means I have to redownload all of my apps. Not impressed, but you get what you pay for I suppose. Keyboard or menu items are not easily found Product went on fine. Then, when we started using it for online meetings, everyone complained that they could barely hear us. Turned out that the screen protector lacked a gap for the microphone. I cut my own. This chrome book's charger port stopped working after 6 months of use. I tried the charger itself on a brand new one that I bought for my mom today and it worked. The brand new charger that came with my Mother's chrome book did not work in the one I bought 6 to 7 months ago. I rarely use this chrome book as I have an hp laptop and a desk top. When I am relaxing in my personal living room and don't want to use any of the bulky or larger computers I use this chrome book. I thought it would be great for travel as well but I haven't gotten to put it to use for that yet and I can't even charge it now. New features to explore. This Chromebook is unbelievably good in many aspects - screen quality, ease to use, 360 deg rotation, keyboard, screen size, touch screen till the time you discover that bluetooth connection is shockingly bad, you simply cant listen to music or watch videos, movies or any content through bluetooth. Most surprising thing is that you wont see any of the reviews talking about it (guess the reviews are deliberately filtered to hide this issue), when you check web there are many mentions of bluetooth connectivity issue with Chromebook as a product irrespective of manufacturer (HP, Lenovo  or Dell). If you dont want to use bluetooth this product is 10/10 esp. at this price. Loved this chromebook until it randomly broke down today. In the month or two leading up to the breakdown, it occasionally acted screwy (had to do a few soft resets). In the four months I've owned it, I've only used it for internet browsing. Contacted Lenovo and sending it in under warranty, but I have to pay for the shipping, which is ridiculous. I'm hoping I just got a defective unit, so if the new one outlast these four months, I might revise this review. In the meantime, be warned. Otherwise, it ran fast and had good sound and a great look. It is slow This is a great little machine. As others have said, once you open it, it boots up in seconds. I'm a heavy google user, so I appreciate that all my daily apps that I hit up are available to me in seconds on this Chromebook. My only complaint is the battery is not as others have stated. I notice that when I use for a few hours, I'll need multiple charges. Even this morning when I woke up the battery said 87%. I popped it into tablet mode, checked my email, 10 minutes later I got a warning about 2% battery left. I may contact the manufacturer just to make sure I did not get a lemon. Great little computer otherwise. I am not a big fan of this brand but my son enjoyed it. The image and sound quality is pretty decent for the price point. The display can be a tiny bit pixelated at times but it isn't a deal breaker for me. The keys are plastic which isn't bad but it feels on the cheaper side.  When I move the screen in any way,from any angle, the LCD in the bottom corners turn white as if I were pressing on the screen. I am a little sad that the track pad isn't durable. I have received this computer today and the right click has already stopped clicking. I had high hopes for this machine as it was going to do everything that I hoped. I bought this to supplement my laptop when I travel to check emails and watch movies. Not sure if what I experienced is an isolated thing or if this is how this computer is made. I really wanted to like this product but in the end had to return it. I did everything to keep it. The product is built with sturdy plastic material that would have fooled me as something else. The display is great under normal\typical conditions. The OS is super fast and you can use google play and Linux etc. Tons of storage about 49 GB available. The hinge felt good. I used it everyday and stop using my now 7 year old windows 10 i3 laptop. What went wrong. Well the screen display was good but it was a little too small at 11.6 inches. The really bad part was the Bluetooth issues. When using Chromebook in laptop mode i use a Bluetooth capable mouse which often stop working randomly for no apparent reason. The Bluetooth would stop responding and once turned off not work again until you power cycled the system. I tired everything to resolve the issue including powerwashing it which is a hard reset to factory. Nothing resolved it. I called tech support and they scripted me. Asked me to powerwash it and then asked me to send it in for motherboard replacement which had a turn around of 9 business days... That is when i decided it was time to let go and return this Chromebook. I highly recommend Chromebooks just not this one. Maybe spend a little more and get something of higher quality if want to use all features especially Bluetooth.Update: 06/26/19It turns out the Bluetooth issue is a conflict with Chrome OS and my Victsing mouse. I now have an Acer r13 and have the same issue. The C330 is nice little multi use Chromebook that is priced nicely. The r13 is bit slower than c330 from my experience so far. The r13 has bigger display and uses micro sd  card that doesn't stick out like on the c330. Also the r13 you only get 32 GB as apposed to 64 GB with C330. I give the C330 3.5 stars. Overall r13 is not a major update over C330 for around $80 dollars more. However they are both very good Chromebooks with big difference being the screen size and on board storage. Screen was quite fuzzy and text was not in any way crisp or well defined. I returned it with no problem. I am unsure if this is a general issue, applicable to all of these, or if I just received a defective one. When I first got this chromebook I was in LOVE! It worked so well and I was excited to start using it! I quickly realized that the chromebook I received had a malfunction on it that caused it to randomly turn off by itself. Thankfully I was able to return the chromebook and recieve a new one. However after  having my new one for a few months I am now having issues with the keyboard as certain keys have stopped working. Clearly this chromebook is only meant to be used for a short time which is disappointing because I was really hoping it would be a good product I would have for sometime. You can‚Äôt even get the YouTube tv app. Waste of money for us . The screen is much tinier than I thought it would be because the edges are almost an inch wide (each) so the actual display is only 10 inches max. I've had it for about 12 hours and the touchscreen was working this morning but at some point it stopped. I've tried every troubleshoot I could find online and in the Help menu and it hasn't been resolved. Seriously considering returning it. On the plus side, it has nice visuals and speakers and it's cute. I like it for what it is, just not sure it was worth over $200. So I've had this computer for about a month now. The first one arrived with a faulty touchscreen, but it was promptly replaced without issue. The hardware of the new one seems to work fine for the most part. There are some weird software glitches with this Chromebook OS though. I would say that at least 2/3 of the apps on the Google Play store don't seem to work correctly on this OS. Example: my Microsoft Outlook app won't let me select individual email accounts, regardless of whether I use my touchscreen or the mouse. I could cite a dozen more examples just like this, but frankly, I don't feel like it's worth my time.Pros:- INSANELY good battery life- Solid build quality- InexpensiveCons:- Glitchy OS- Poor app integration- Not the fastestFinal verdict:I don't think I would buy it again because I really don't like the Chromebook OS. If this same computer could be had with Windows, it would be a homerun. As it sits, I'd recommend spending a little more money and getting something a little more tried-and-true. I purchase this computer for my girlfriend back in Sept of 2019. Overall the computer has worked fine, but a few days ago the camera stopped working. We have been doing a lot of Zoom video chats and without a camera, well you can imagine. I had an older ACER Chromebook from 6 years ago that needed to be retired due to its limitations (but it was STILL made like a tank!), and I jumped on the opportunity to ""upgrade"" to this Lenovo model. All in all, its a GOOD jump. Just GOOD.Out of the box, its a beautiful clean device. Good weight, nice screen, clean lines all around. After the usual initial setup (which is very easy due to the simplicity of Google), the battery life is definitely longer compared to my old Chromebook. I didn't really clock it but even with multiple tabs running at full brightness and full audio, id say it was about 5 hours before I had to plug in, which sets you up for a good idea on how long it performs when you're frugal with your power usage. Audio was very clear, screen had good resolution and responsive touch feedback (but a fingerprint and smudge magnet!) and does well in the multiple tablet modes while still staying snug.Build-wise is where the issues arise. While light, it is very obvious after long use, plasticky. The keyboard tends to be rather noisy and clicky at at times non-responsive and annoying. There's been times that button presses don't respond at all which FORCED me to switch to the tablet modes and rely on the touch-screen.This is at best, a home Chromebook and not meant for travel and for actual work due to its build limitations. Splurge on extra money and get the higher-end models with better construction and materials if you plan on using this for hard work.UPDATE 3/15/19Buttons DO lose tactile response and I'm NOT a heavy handed guy at all. TOP upper-right keys do not respond 4/5 times and so do the ASDF column. So to update, the ROWS that control key functions like brightness, backspace, and enter buttons DO NOT WORK. Seriously WTF. DID I GET A REFURBISHED UNIT???UPDATE 9/19/19Backspace, volume, brightness, MOST letter buttons are TOTALLY non-functioning anymore. Do yourselves a favor and pay more for a more premium build. This is absolutely comical at how bad the build quality isn't this point. Unless you are only looking to do some light internet browsing and document preparation I suggest that you get something other than a chromebook. The supposedly easy setup failed with an obscure and unhelpful error message on the first try.  I called Lenovo for assistance, but I was told that they mainly provide only hardware support, but could provide software support for $39, which I declined.  I called the Google tech support number Lenovo gave me but just got a recording directing me to their internet support site.  On my own, I started the setup a second time from scratch and was successful in getting the Chromebook goingAs a number of reviewers have reported, the full-sized SD card sticks far out from the left side port, making the card vulnerable to damage and inconveniently in the way when using as a laptop; why full-size, Lenovo?The power supply cord has an in-line transformer block, not optimal for laptop use or storage/transportation.The Chromebook comes with 100 Gig of Google cloud storage free for 1 year, but taking advantage of this offer required some research.  Google should have made this perk more obvious and easy to enable on setup. Easy to set up"
48,Levi's Men's 505 Regular Fit Jeans,Computers,"There were very obvious vertical white lines running thru the color of the fabric . Bad die run?  Going to Walmart to see if their""s have the same. Some what larger than needed. Fit just right.  Not too loose or too tight.  Durable and attractive garment Surprised it didnt fit worth a crap.  Unfortunately I tried them on too late and they wont return.  Shows over 30 days. I ordered the Fremont crank bait dark indigo color jeans expecting them to be the color shown in the pictures. The jeans showed up on time but we‚Äôre a completely different color then what I excepted. They are a much lighter color. These Levi's fit perfectly.  Waist, legs and length were as described. good quality product .and quick shipping. My husband called Levi's.  They want to have my husband send in a form.  They will evaluate it, then they may ask him to send the jeans back. I‚Äôve purchased multiple pair of L505 Regular fit jeans, and none of them fit the same. I e purchased multiple L505 stretch and none of them fit the same. I grew up wearing Levi‚Äôs but the product is junk now, it‚Äôs inconsistent and unless I can try them on in a store to guarantee fit, I won‚Äôt be buying them. In fact, because I think online clothing purchases in general have proven to be a bad idea, and end up lacking in quality, I just won‚Äôt be doing it anymore. Yeah sure I can just return them, but it‚Äôs a pain in my ass. I can just go to the store, try on a few pair and get the right fit. Don‚Äôt buy any Levi‚Äôs online. pants not like they use to be but ya know banglidesh is not the usa but even still the length should be right  they are like 2"" too long the color is not the same as the picture, any way i need a pair so i'll live  with it but never again i,ll go back to walmart cheapeees or wranglers I had to order new Jeans as a 69 year old retiree who has gained weight (not just from COVID Hibernation).  My older size 36 do not fit anymore.  I transgressed to size 38.  I had older Levis for years.  So I ordered these 505s.  These seem to have the same quality of my older Jeans - except for the fly zipper.  That is definitely a downgrade from years ago.  But the Jeans material is of very good quality.  Keep in mind these are made of solid grade material, they are not ""light"".  They were a little too loose (I also ordered 550s, they were way too loose and baggy, sent that pair back), so I washed them in very warm water and hot dryer, and they did shrink and now fit perfectly.  They are a little too long (32) because I have Shrunk over the years from Degenerative Disc Disease in my spine).  Unfortunately , no 31s were listed for 38 waste measurment. But I can live with it.  Overall, I will probably order another pair in another color.  I am overall, very satisfied with the product. Got the wrong color. Not as expected They did not make these correctly so we had to return them. Off shore, and poorly made. It was not a 32-30 Fits great with more stretch than I‚Äôm used to with Levi‚Äôs. However they seem much thinner than typical Levi‚Äôs.  I‚Äôve wearing them 2-3 days per week.  Time will tell if they hold up. Would like some 28 inch inseams. Levy‚Äôs must have changed their material.  Bought the right size for my husband but on the first wearing they ripped along the pocket when he bent over.  Embarrassing especially since  it was his first day on the job. I still like the fit, but the last few pairs of these have not held up well. This pair lost a pocket rivet the second time they were washed and the previous two pairs ripped at the rear pocket within six months. Wrong color Fit üëçgreat Material is so thin like these are womens pants. While they may be 100% cotton, these have no heft or weight and will likely wear out at a faster pace then a t-shirt. Levis has clearly gone the wrong direction. You cannot find anything robust unless you get a 550 or 501 and then you are only stuck in blue. If Levis wants to cater to kids, this is it. perfect Zipper won‚Äôt stay up. Kinda disappointed with that considering the price. I had lost enough weight that I needed to downsize. Color matches, but no longer could I find the note made (somewhere not in the US) with cotton grown in the US. Result - the taper shrinks at the belt line. The button girth was shortened, possibly to save material. Had to return but love color and style They fitted fine thanks I liked every item I have purchased. Not this pair, but the 2 pairs prior the pants split in the rear rite on the pocket line. Pants were NOT TIGHT.  Both pairs split in the exact same spot? Defect? I am a levis guy, so I continue to purchase. Both pairs were fairly new not worn when they split! Size was way off. Ordered a 38W and it said that on the pants. However they were closer to being a 34. Tight at waistline.  An I wear a lot of Levi's,  an know my size. These were not 30's The crotch falls a bit short. Like them a ton just wish the material felt more soft to the skin, that being said once they get washed a ton I think they'll be a 5 out of 5 star Fit is accurate I sometimes have doubts this is a genuine Levi Product, though it looks authentic.  Overall the fit and look are fine, but the material quality leaves me a bit suspect.  Regardless, I would very likely buy this product again. Color too tight and small Have several pairs of these in the same size. This new pair is noticeably larger and looser fitting. Sizing was off.  Much larger than expected. I specifically ordered these to have light blue jeans. Went through the selections thoroughly, and carefully selected ''clif.'' Showed to be very light in color. Ended up with very dark blue! I have stronger words I'd like to use, but this RUFFLED MY FEATHERS to no end. Get it together LEVIS. Like the jeans and use for casual wear. Didn‚Äôt fit, sending back. To large in the hip/crotch area. Good looking jeans but. Or the most appealing fit. These ""Levis"" appeared to be a cheap knock-off. Very thin fabric, bottom of the leg ripped and frayed.Nothing like a true Levi. These Levi‚Äôs are at a great price the length and waist size are as expected they also have a great color overall great pair a jeans. They‚Äôre Levi jeans‚Ä¶ they fit as designed Price I bought two pairs of 505 jeans and the black jeans are a different material much thinner and fit like skinny jeans? I tried 3 pairs of these jeans but all three fit funny in the seat.  It was like there was extra fabric in one area and when I put them on they puckered out near the pocket instead of being flush with my b*tt.  I had to send all 3 back. Bought the pants in October.  I have worn them probably a dozen times.  Washed a couple times and yesterday (March 3), I bent over and they split from the waist to the top of my leg.  Never had this happen to me before.  And yes, I haven't gained any weight.  This is the same size pants I have always worn.  I would return them for new ones if I could, but I see the time to return is past. liked product Washes and dries differently than denim. Used these maybe three times and the zipper is sticking. Maybe a fluke but wish I would‚Äôve used them more prior to the return window closing. The pants were fine, with a good fit, but the zipper failed after only a couple of months. I have had better luck with non-Levi's jeans bought at the same time. This is my husband's favorite style of Levi's! Pants are stiff. Washed 4 times now and still very stiff These do not fit like the ones you buy at your local store. I wear a 32-33 and these ones that I bought on Amazon fit me like a 30 31. I would recommend you go to your local store that sells these and try them on. As described The height is too low so the pants droop For a relaxed fit they are tight Washed and worn twice when the jeans slip the length of zipper to the left of it.  Fabric compromised.  Disappointed because Levi‚Äôs generally wear a very long time. Would be nice to have a 37 waist with a28‚Äù leg. Went with a 38‚ÄùW looks a little big I have 36?‚Äù and they are a little tight. I would not purchase anymore. Im older and Levis used ot be great jeans. Now made In CHINA junk. I'm sorry.... the new word is ""imported"".....I buy American made for a little more, but it is worth it. These got thin too. They weight of denim advertised, in my opinion, is not real. Google ""made in America Jeans""... these suck ass. Product great, delivery manner not ok Fit was good. Levi's aren't the same quality as they used to be. Within 3 months,  all 3 pairs developed a hole above back pocket that became a tear out. I'm only a 180 lb guy, so it wasn't me being fat. These Levis Jeans fit great. Nice heavy fabric and most of all the great price. Now I just ordered another pair. One leg was smaller around and from the wast to the croch was short so if ibent over half my butt crack sticks out I've never bought a pair like this ever in my life"

It‚Äôs so cute and transparent so I could put stickers on my computer without actually sticking them onto it Very good quality! Looks and fits great . It fits great but covers one of the USB-C plugs and since there is limited plugs as it is i have to take off the bottom piece to use both usb-c plugs. It clearly doesn't fit and shouldn't be advertised that it does. Returning. Not satisfied with my purchase, the design looks good but it covered one of my ports so not sure it is in fact meant for the MacBook version indicated in the listing. The corners cracked fairly easily by simple use (opening and closing) my laptop has never been dropped, yet the corner is cracked. Would not recommend getting the clear because you can literally see every fingerprint. Quality was ok; the storage bag in the description is very misleading. It‚Äôs a small bag - enough to carry the charger and not the laptop.Definitely cheaper ones available Cracked on corner already when it arrived Ended up never using this because the top portion was too big. The bottom piece fit fine. Cheap product. Top plastic broke 2 times. I got two replacements in the mail and every one of them broke, without me dropping and hitting the case. Bad Product. Came with a lot of extra garbage, no directions, and the keyboard protector was really disappointing This case fits fine, but the corners on the top half of mine quickly became cracked/crumbled, despite very gentle handling and my computer living inside a padded carrying case. It's still protecting my laptop, it's just as pretty as I'd like. This may not be the case with all colors, but I have the clear one. It wasn‚Äôt the easiest to install but it‚Äôs not too bad either. Great protection though. Dint even use it for a week and it already cracked very disappointed I purchased the Peacock Green. I love the color. The case fits my a2337 model MacBook Air M1. The keyboard over is nice too. They sent two models, to ensure your protection for two models of keyboard. They also included a screen protector (I didn't use) and a nice carrying bag for the Macbook cords. The one thing I am not as happy about is you cannot see the apple sign through the top. I thought the case was going to be a little more transparent or allow the lit apple to shine through. No biggie... I still love the case. I just got it today, so I cannot speak to durability... yet. I love the colors I bought two but one of them was too hard to put in even though still lose in my MacBook üíª The color is just as pictured super cute hot pink or ‚Äúrose red‚Äù. However I can‚Äôt open my laptop past 90 degrees, the bottom portion pops off. Wish I would have read the reviews, I normally do but didn‚Äôt this time.Screen protector is a joke,Bonus I got to keyboard protectors when I thought it should only be one.Overall not worth the price, return! It‚Äôs a pretty good product the only thing is it doesn‚Äôt have the apple logo on it like in the picture Bought for device 2020 MacBook Air A2337. Snapped on easy and came with a screen protector and 2 keyboard covers. Bottom cover did not fit well. It's loose on the front two corners. Top cover fits fine. All ports are visible and accessible. This case does not allow the MacBook to open past 90 degrees. Doesn't show fingerprints too bad, but it does show them. It scratches easily and quickly.I will be returning this item. It's cute and was definitely the look I was going for, it is completely clear, doesn't show fingerprints. However, the top does not fit correctly no matter what you do. It won't completely click over the one side. It fits well enough that it stays on but it is a little annoying that it doesn't cover one of the corners and sticks up just a little. I definitely would not buy again. loved it so much feels very cheap It took me a while to figure out how to fit the cover completely but it works just fine! Easy to install. It‚Äôs the amount of protection that I wanted. My daughter and I both ordered these covers for our new MacBook Airs. She ordered the light blue and it fit perfectly, she loves it! I ordered the frost. The bottom fits great but I could only get 3 corners to snap on the top cover.I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a replacement. My husband was able to get the top cover on all 4 corners. He got fingerprints on the inside of the cover so I took it off to clean it and when I replaced it, I cracked one of the corners. I put the first cover on and I still can't get it to fit on all 4 corners but it is staying. Must be something with the frost covers because my daughter didn't have any problems with hers.The company has great customer service, so would highly recommend. This laptop cover is super nice! It‚Äôs smooth to the touch, fairly easy to put on the computer and comes with 2 keyboard covers and a screen protector! The keyboard covers are also very nice and overall a great product!! Love this but rating a 4 because somehow I already cracked the corner. Whoops! Probably user error. I got the midnight green and it looks very good! Comes with 2 different keyboard silicone covers, one for a different model. Unfortunately, you are unable to see the apple logo but in my opinion, it gives it a minimalistic look! screen protector broken but the rest was fine after a week the corners all cracked. Never dropped or bumped. Product arrived and I was so excited to get it and use on my new MacBook.  The case was hard to install on the MacBook and I have only had it on for one night and the case is already cracked.  I have never dropped laptop and seriously after one night it is cracked. Pros: Very nice looking and easy to install.Cons: Flimsy. Let me say that I'm not rough with my computer at all. I don't travel with it. It basically stays in the same place all the time. It started cracking and chipping for no apparent reason. The little rubber feet starting coming off as well. Snapped into place immediately and the fit is perfect. My case cracked all over the edges in just two weeks! Do not recommend love everything else about this product, but it does crack very easily in corners very durable This item was cracked when I received it, but just decided to keep it since I purchased it to do a project and covering it with rhinestones. I liked this case because it was clear but within a day of having it and installing it properly on my Mac the corner cracked. It was easy to install and the sheerness is perfectly fine. This fit my new 13in Macbook Air perfectly and it was easy to install. It‚Äôs a sleek hard protective gel case and perfect for school! It was a good fit but it cracks pretty easily. I cannot fit it properly on my laptop, one of the worst purchases of 2020 The case I was sent did not fit the 2020 version of the computer as it claimed to. It fit my old computer, which wasn‚Äôt much of a help. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt properly fit my new one. I purchased this for my daughter‚Äôs Mac. She loves it; but I think the plastic is a little too thin for the price.  I‚Äôm not too impressed with the possible durability.  She‚Äôs had it for about a month now and so good so far. So we‚Äôll see. I got the clear one and it‚Äôs so beautiful. My only complaint is that I had to press pretty hard to get the top piece on and I was so scared I was about to break my brand new $1,500 laptop üòÖ it snapped on, but with force... nerve racking force. I think these cases are intended for scratches more than they are for damages. Overall it‚Äôs a good product for the price. I bought this orange color because wanted to give the color some love on my new MacBook & let me tell you, this orange is that beautiful stand out orange. Also, I love the feel of the keyboard color. Anyways, if you need a pop out color, this orange is for sure that one. It‚Äôs a good case, the color that I picked it‚Äôs exactly as the picture, however It would be great if they bring a liquid to clean the case. Seemed like a great price and a good product, unfortunately, all 4 corners of the top have cracked and chipped in under 1 month. Used carefully and always stored in a lined & padded carry case. Disappointed for sure You have to wrestle this case down because it is very hard to install. I thought I was going to break my computer, but fortunately that didn't happen It broke after a week when my laptop fell. Didn‚Äôt protect my laptop at all Love the clear but the bottom part comes off doesn‚Äôt stay on anymore it did for a while . The keyboard skin does not align at all, love the color, unfortunate that it isn‚Äôt exact, also f6 and  command symbols are incorrect and different. I like how it's virtually invisible.  I've spilled a little coffee on it with no issues.  It is however, not that sturdy, so don't expect much protection from falls or bumps. Delivery was fast but for some people installation might be somewhat challenging because the instruction paper does not go step by step on how to assemble the product. There are some stickers that came with the product that I had no idea how I am supposed to use them. The product also came with a nice little cloth bag where one can put the extra keyboard protection. The product came with two keyboard protection by the way, which is great. Overall, I am satisfied with the product. It's not super fancy but it serves the purpose, which is to protect the MacBook Air. I have a MacBook Air 2020 and the product's fit is not quite right, but I decided to keep it anyways. Verify your computer model before purchasing it. I got the sheer case, its great but definitely wouldn't be able to rely on it on my MacBook Air as its only protection. It great if you want to avoid scratches and decorate it with stickers. -Macbook Air 30in With M1 Chip 2021-Just leaving this review so that other people who look at all the negative reviews and are confused have somewhere to look. Yes, this fits the Macbook Air 30in with the M1 chip, 2021. And does not leave any gap, nor is it flimsy.Highly recommend. I was expecting a white case that was sheer enough to show apple sign, but it wasn't. so I had to put apple sticker on the case. Also, the case does not completely snap on to the bottom of my MacBook Air, but it does stay on and provide the protection I wanted. the little bag it comes with is cute, and perfect to hold the charger, and the keyboard protector feels cool, although it moves around sometimes. not as sticky as I thought. but it comes with two of those! so that's nice. it gets dirty quickly because of the white, but all it takes is a quick wipe down and it looks good. overall, I like it. broke after having for only a month I had the case for few months but it broke in the corners. Had to remove it as its sharp. The case itself is cute, however it is an EXTREMELY tight fit on my MacBook Air 2020 - it was not easy to install and took a good amount of pressure to get it snapped in. It is also not very durable. Over the course of a month taking it back & forth to school (in a padded sleeve in her backpack) the case has already cracked in the corners, and the little rubber feet have come off the bottom. The case came in a great color. Initially the keyboard cover worked great and stuck to the keyboard. However, after ~2 weeks of use, it stopped sticking to the keys and moved around with use. The Mosiso MackBook Air case fit the latest MacBook just fine, but it cracked with normal use within a week. The laptop is always transported within a backpack, and when it's not in my lap it's safely out of harm's way. Not much to say about a product that breaks with normal use besides DON'T BUY IT. Good quality, scratches easily It doesn‚Äôt fit the MacBook that I purchased even though it was advertised in a size to fit Best product for the price Cheaply made Overall, this is a good bang for your buck. I didn‚Äôt expect it to come with a keyboard cover and a screen protector, which I didn‚Äôt use, but the case itself is really easy to install and is tough. My only complaint is that with the newer M1 MacBooks, they don‚Äôt have air ports on the bottom and as a result, the case still has the holes for the air, this makes it look a bit weird since there are holes for air to go through, but they actually aren‚Äôt there. Still a good case though, won‚Äôt return it just for that minor inconvenience. The case is okay, but my main issue is that the keyboard cover doesn‚Äôt line up. I got the correct one, but the letters don‚Äôt match up with the backlit ones on the cover. I have double vision trying to type. The symbols on the cover also dont match the ones on the keyboard. I had to buy another one :/ This product is nice but the bottom cover does not stay on at all It leaves too many fingerprints I like the case. Pretty color and easy to install. The screen protector was rather easy to install with not many bubbles. However, the keyboard cover does not show the backlit keys, nor does it really fit the letters on the keyboard. Bit upset about that. I want to give this cover a great rating but unfortunately it broke quickly. I barely touched it once it was on and it cracked. It also was kind of challenging to get on. I do love the color and that it came with a matching keyboard cover. Not as pictured or easy to install. Ok quality Got it for my boyfriend for his MacBook Air. It does its job, only thing is the keyboard thing it comes with. Gets dirty quick, leaves keyboard prints on the screen (you see it when you open your MacBook after it's been closed for a bit), and slides off easily. Would invest in a different one, besides that the case does its job. Fits my new MacBook Air perfectly. OK Bought this based on reviews. I just bought an M1 MacBook Air and it directly fits my computer. Nothing else to say. It works for me. I haven‚Äôt drop tested it yet but no worries at this point. 5 Stars from me. At first all was going well and it fit well with my MacBook Air 2020. Not even 5 months in it started cracking the case with no pressure. I only use if for my zoom lectures on my desk and nothing more. I was disappointed of it not lasting long and paying 25$ for it not to even last a year. I tried taking it off before more damage happened and it snapped. Oh well. Breaks super easy. First day I had it, put nice in backpack and all and it was broke within minutes. Consistently falls off my MacBook Fit perfect product arrived with noticeable scratch on back cover and indent on protective screen. Hard to install, did not fit properly. Scratched up within a few days of use and cracked on every corner within a couple months transporting to and from work. Not very durable. Case would also not always stay on tightly and come off. I ensure that I checked the model of my laptop several times and search by my model to ensure that it fits because I am outside the US and cannot return it.It said that it was the model of my laptop yet it was almost impossible to get the top cover on smh.Was happy with the look till it started cracking at the edges after around 3 months. I have never hit my laptop nor have it fallen and it just started cracking.One of the edges on the top has almost completely broken off and the cover having trouble staying on.I am disappointed that I have to buy another one already, and for sure will avoid this brand. Nice case indeed, only flaw is keyboard cover doesn't stay in place This did not fit my laptop as explained in the details. I had the correct model of MacBook, but the bottom piece did not fit correctly. It‚Äôs also has easily cracked and shows scratches and fingerprints. It looks much more cheap than I wanted.  I would not recommend this product. I really love how it's so clear and really easy to put on your laptop. Scratches very easily, does not fit quite right, not protected if computer is dropped. Did not fit my air The case doesn‚Äôt let the computer open all the way The case is super clear and shiny, but I've only had it for less than a month and two corners are cracked already. same thing happened on another case that I purchased from the same company. Decided to give them a second try, but won't be spending anymore money on their cases unfortunately. Great product, looks good on my new apple macbook air with the M1 chip 13in. I got the grey color which makes my silver mabook air look really nice. The case is exactly how I imagined. The screen protector arrived bent and damaged, therefore unusable. First of all, the keyboard case didn't even stretch over the keys properly and would fall off constantly. 3 days in and the corners of my laptop case completely cracked off and left super sharp insecure edges. In frustration I ended up taking the keyboard cover off as well because it would constantly fall off and slide. The screen protecter was decent but it leaves a lot of bubbles and glare despite how straight you get it so I had to trash that and get a new one. Worst Purchase ever ... but at least I have a cheap velvet bag now ;) This is a good product overall for the price you pay. However it is a little misleading in that you‚Äôre actually not able to see the Apple symbol through the case, which I may have just read incorrectly. The screen protector does not stick as well as it should but the rest of the product is great. Unfortunately, fingerprints easily made it look terrible. Would not use this in front of a client. Going to return. I love it, sadly the back corners to it broke within a week of me having it. :( Qualify and fit is great. Key board cover keeps falling off and also makes the keys less visible Looked good at first but I dropped my laptop within a few weeks of having the case from waist level. The case broke and came off, damaging my laptop! Super bummed. Firstly, it looks good. But it doesn‚Äôt fit.It blocks one of the usb C and therefore is useless.The top attaching to the screen broke on install. This product is useless.It doesn‚Äôt fit and it was brittle. Just save yourself some money and don‚Äôt buy it. I ordered this case for my 13in Macbook Air and  it came a half inch to small. unfortunately i purchased back in may and now I don't think i can get a refund. So frustrating.... Exceeds expectations. Product was cracked I ordered the olive green one, in all of the photos they have it shows that you can see the apple logo on the top of the computer through the case. I can't see it at all, even with my computer open and on. It looks really plain and I'm looking for something new. I loved the fact that it came with so much stuff it‚Äôs not only the case! The case does not completely fit properly. Whenever you fully open the mac book the bottom case part pops off. This product does not show the apple logo through it as shown in the photo. This was disappointing. Was not happy. The packaging ruined the screen protectors. Came with a terrible square indent from its own plastic card! The case was good. But never even got to install the screen protectors. Horrible material!! make sure to read reviews! lol this product does not fit the new MacBook Air even though it says its compatible. I wish I would've read these reviews first before I bought it lol just save yourself the trouble of having to do a return and make sure you read reviews first. So far so good, I was specting anything because of the mixed reviews about not firing the laptop as advertised, but if fits like a glove! The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the keyboard protector, it is not updated to the latest key changes for the F keys (dictation and do not disturb keys). I immediately threw away the keyboard cover, a waste of plastic Does not fit the Mac book air 2020 like it states Chip supper easily I bought the right size and one side wouldn't fit I had to press SO HARD on my laptop for this thing to clip on I thought I would damage it.  Worst of all, I couldn‚Äôt open the laptop past 90 degrees. That‚Äôs just sad. Ended up buying from Incase. Fits fine, but if are going to install it, make sure you clean the inside and outside of the MacBook before installing.  Because once you do, you will need the jaws of life to remove it.  I almost broke my MacBook trying to remove the cover. If this case had fit, I probably would have been happy with it. But it was just ever-so-off and wouldn't let the laptop click in. This was disappointing because in the description, it says it's supposed to fit the model I have. At first we thought this was a great product But we had noticed that our MacBook was losing battery power pretty quickly and realized the case was not allowing it to close fully With great effort, we initially managed to get the lid cover to snap into place. Now it has snapped off and I am unable to get it back on. I fear using more pressure against my laptop screen might damage the screen. I have a Mac Pro it said it fit and try would not click into place and it had missing part the keyboard part was not in the package Didn‚Äôt fit mac book  super disappointing broke after a month It's an Okay cover, but the edges keep cracking and chipping off by themselves because I haven't dropped my Macbook yet. Also, the air holes under the laptop and the edges collect dust over time. keyboard thing keeps slipping off and case started to break after a couple of months its worth the money! Better than expected! It was a little difficult to put the top part of the case, but it worked after a few tries. Other than that, so far so good! Nothing special with the over. Made of regular plastic. Will prevent scratch on device but it‚Äôs just like any other plastic plate. It was was a perfect fit. There was also a bag for your charger and headphones. It also came with two Keyboard covers so you can easily replace them. It was overall very worth it. Not sure what the other reviews were talking about, I received the new MacBook Air from my school and this case is perfect. I have a MacBook Air. This cover is fine to protect the computer short term, but it will not allow for my adapter to plug in as the plastic is in the way. It also slides a little on the bottom when opening and closing. The plastic was a little scratched out of the plastic it came in. It seems to scratch easily. It was inexpensive and I needed something right away so it fits the purpose. I will have to buy another cover. It has never my house and the case broke from carrying up and down the stairs. Terrible! This laptop case went into the garbage the day after I got it. First, it didn‚Äôt fit my laptop (yes, I double checked the dimensions). When I put it on, the two top edges of the cage cracked almost instantly. The bottom piece fit fine but when I would open my laptop, the case was in the way and I couldn‚Äôt open the screen all the way.Although, I will say that the keyboard cover is soft and works well, no issues with buttons sticking or anything. The screen protector is also perfectly fine. These are the only two reasons I gave this product 2/5 stars. The bottom piece didnt fit :( No storage bag. I‚Äôm just noticing this. Cracked after a couple of days. The cover is fine and all but the rest of the products are trash except the little bag. The keyboard cover isn't perfect since you can't even see the lights for the letters and its doesn't align with them. The screen protector was hard to put on since one of the tags to remove the plastic didn't even work and it was very easy to get bubbles in. Would just the cover tbh. I constantly have to pop the bottom piece back in place & it‚Äôs been less than 2months and I‚Äôm already having to replace one of the nonslip stickers on the bottom. & I know it‚Äôs to protect from cracks but every time I look I see dust between the computer and the case. Would return if return date hadn‚Äôt passed already.I‚Äôve never dropped my computer so I can‚Äôt attest to its ability to prevent cracks. It is true that I paid $20 for this protecting case which comes with the case (outer shell), keyboard protector, screen protector and case for the charger. It was a good deal however, the color was not black as I expected. It was kind of dark space gray. There was no instructions for how to apply the screen protector. finally, the keyboard protector does't fit the type of keyboard I have in my MacBook air 13 inch 2020. I am not very satisfied with this purchase. Excellent fit Did not fit my 2019 MacBook Pro. I‚Äôm very disappointed in Amazon for not giving options and assuming that all are the same. The cover fit with a lot of force. The keyboard protector is not completely transparent. It has letters printed on it It is as advertisedBeautiful color...I love the keyboard covers, too! It doesn't not fit properly. It fits like a person with size 9 feet is trying on a size 7 shoe. In addition, It covers the ports. And no, it was not placed on backwards. I've already checked. Back to square one. Took so long to get this case on my computer and in the end it still does not fit completely. Disappointed in that but overall it is a nice case. Great color, no apple logo makes my computer more discrete, feels nice to the touch and keyboard cover fits well. I loved every bit of the product. you get a lot for your money. my only issue is that my screen protector came bent so i could not install it. It‚Äôs broken. It‚Äôs like a week and it broke. It‚Äôs also cheap. Get what ya get. I guess my laptop isn‚Äôt and this is. But dang. I‚Äôm gonna be broke instea did the laptop if I keep buying this. I bought the silver gray one for my MacBook Air 2020 with M1 chip and it fitted perfectly, but only after trying a few times. The top part wouldn't fit in one of the corners first, and I was scared of trying too hard and damaging the screen while doing so. However, it did fit at the end.Also, the color is not the same as depicted in the photos. It's not a see-through gray, it's opaque, so that's kinda disappointing, and I'm worried the painting it has can be scratched.As for the keyboard cover, it fits all of the keys perfectly and it has a good feel to the material, but unfortunately, some of the top keys symbols don't match the actual function of the key.All things considering, I'm pretty pleased with the purchase. This was a replacement because there was a scratch on the cover on the original order. Unfortunately, the replacement one also had visible marks on the cover. Have to return and try another brand or type of cover. Makes everything discolored, has bubbles no matter how you press it out, and extremely hard to align to screen. Mine had kinks in it from handling it and I had to throw it out. Case itself is thin but does not feel durable at all and would not protect computer from damage aside from scratches"
51,"MOSISO Laptop Sleeve Bag Compatible with 13-13.3 inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Notebook Computer, Polyester Vertical Case with Pocket, Gray",Computers,"The 13.3 is a bit big to fit a new MacBook Air and the 13 is too small. If you have a protective case on your Mac, get the 13.3 because the 13 without a case doesn‚Äôt fit at all. not best It works well for the tipe laptop I have. A little big, even though I ordered the smaller 13"" size specifically for the MacBook Air. The stitched on logo is is hideous though. Ended up cutting the thread and removing it. Pretty easy to do with a sharp blade.Still, a solid protective cover for your computer. Worth the price. Great case. Super soft interior and the color is like a muted crimson! Love the small pocket in the front outside the case. Highly recommended! I love it and it‚Äôs  wet light weight ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è It looks nicer in the picture. It‚Äôs kind of cheap looking . But some protection is better than none Mine came with a snag in the inner lining, so I can't close one zipper all the way because it catches and almost throws the whole zipper off track. It something small but it is a little annoying. This product fits a15‚Äù . I had specified a 13‚ÄùOther than that it‚Äôs good for the money. This product is a very cheap piece of plastic, it doesn‚Äôt protect the item at all, first time dropped it broke and also the iPad was damaged when it fell. I will never ever buy it again. I really liked this bag and the color.However I don‚Äôt think it is super safe for my laptop. It needs more foam around the edges to protect the laptop from any bumps This product is durable and very resilient to my daily abuse. it has kept my macbook in the best shape. The biggest improvement compared to my previous case was a pocket on the outside, great for lens clotch, adapters and extensions. The company also took care of the product when i had concerns. Extremely professional and quick to respond/resolve! The color is definitely NOT wine red!! Is more like hot pink! Quality and material is good. Just very disappointed with the color description since I was looking more for a burgundy, maroon color. Please note, when it says 13 inch, it means the case is 13 inches, not that it fits a 13 inch laptop. Looks good, but the zipper isn't very durable. Great and especially for the price. Very sturdy Wine red color isn‚Äôt accurate, it‚Äôs pink Doesn't fit on advertised laptop Its much larger than my brand new mac book pro. The material seemed to be decent and protective, but it was just too large for the 13 inch macbook. There was at least an extra half inch of room around all sides, and I want a snug fit on my laptop, so I‚Äôm returning and ordering one from incase instead. A little small. But computer does fit in it. Made for a thinner MacBook. Bought burgundy/maroon and it‚Äôs pink The blue was not as pastel as I had hoped for. It was more of a bright, almost neon, blue. The outside was very stiff and just poor quality. It came with a couple of creases/wrinkles. The inside was nice and soft to protect the laptop. My M1 MacBook Pro slides around in the sleeve and is not snug at all. Build is fine, just feels flimsy when my laptop is in it since it is so loose. Good case but I think it scratched my laptop. I took really good care of my laptop but there are three scratches on the very side of it which is pretty sure are from the zipper of the case. A lot of others left good reviews so I might be the exception but if did scratch my laptop which does bother me a lot. Besides that, it‚Äôs a good case. Color looked a little old, I got the light blue The side zipper broke on the first zip. The fabric is good, the zipper is not good. Super happy with my purchase. I have a feeling it will protect my Mac pretty good. This external drive does not work.  I've tried it on my laptop and I've tried it on my daughter's.  It's as if it is not even plugged in.  Other USB devices work.  I've now tried it numerous times. The front pocket is a little tighter than i would like. The charger feels kind of like it can mess the laptop if the weight of the items in the bag press on it. Cute color, the yellow. I just have to keep the charger outside which... is kind of lame. Good quality fabric that fits both my laptop and my iPad inside. Keeps my tech safe and is easy to fit in a backpack and transport. This case is HUGE - way too big for a 13 inch MBP. Super disappointing due to the reviews. I‚Äôll have to do better research next time. It should bring more protection against bumps and handles to carry it more comfortable I love the laptop sleeve bag that MOSISO selling. They are exactly as the product description says. The only reason I gave four stars is that the crease marks stay with bags. Even still, I bought a second one and planning to purchase a third one. The colors are stunningly accurate as their product images. I bought this to protect my new MacBook in my backpack. I have a computer pouch in my backpack but I wanted to add a little extra protection. I love the case except for one big flaw. Right out of the package the zipper gets stuck after you zip it about 1/4 of the way closed. I am thinking about returning it. I suppose you get what you pay for. I just really want to like this case but that zipper kills me. Perfect size and protects my laptop from things like scratches and dust great sleeve. haven‚Äôt had problems with it yet This seemed great. Took it out of the package and tossed all packing materials immediately given the current virus climate. Only to find out days later when using it for the first time that the zipper is broken. Looks like it was sewn on poorly and has no likelihood of my being able to fix it by just adjusting the teeth. Would not buy again. I have an Incase labtop sleeve from 12 years ago that is in great shape. I would just use that if I weren't already using it for my 12 year old computer. Will be looking for something of better quality to replace this. Material was not what I expected, feels a little cheap but overall does the job. Water resistant, soft insides, and enough room for my iPad Air and keyboard plus some accessories in the front pouch. Get dust easily. But the pocket outside is very useful, you can store your charger brick, cables and a mouse with no problem at all. Material by the zipper broke so I could no longer use it. The case did not fit my 2012 MacBook Pro with a hard cover on it so I returned the item. It wouldn't zip around the corners so the laptop could easily slip out. However, the product itself seemed to be good quality. It was thick with a softer inside to help protect the laptop. I'm disappointed that I had to return the item because it didn't fit. Too big, but it worked PERFECTLY for my wife's dated MacBook Pro: width, depth, and height!!! Oh well, my wife's happy now. Quit misrepresenting, my MacBook Air was sliding around in this sleeve because it's way TOO BIG!! Good look and feel, definitely a quality product.The sizing is a bit misleading however. My 13.3‚Äù MBP has a good few inches of slide room within the case. Sure, it ‚Äúfits‚Äù... but then again, any pillow case or sleeping bag would also ‚Äúfit‚Äù a 13.3in laptop.Still use it. The ‚Äòloose‚Äô protection in my backpack is better than none... but if your looking for a snug fit for a 13.3‚Äù laptop, look elsewhere It‚Äôs cute and has good cushioning on the inside to protect my laptop. There is still enough room to zip it, without zipping on top of the laptop itself. I also love that I can put my iPad in the pocket on the outside. I can‚Äôt close it within that pocket, but it‚Äôs nice to have the option to have them together. I specifically searched for a laptop bag that would fit a new MacBook Pro and this popped up. I purchased it and it too big for my laptop. It‚Äôs a shame because it‚Äôs lined well and has an exterior pocket that I truly like. Protected my MacBook from me falling down the stairs. Great buy This product is great and I love the durability. However, for the product that is considered wine red and the image represented were misleading. If you like a warm fuchsia, then this is the product you want. If you're wanting a more deep red or warm maroon, this is not it. Very loose, if you have a newer model MacBook. Don‚Äôt buy this, it‚Äôs like a hotdog down a hallway. I could prob fit two laptops in this if I wanted to and still have room them to slide around in. The laptop bag is not suitable for HP Spectra 360 13.3 inch , as it says it fits for this model. This bag is too big for this model, fake advertisement for HP. Love the product , I won‚Äôt give it a review on water resistance because I have  not come across that yet. Other than that I‚Äôm extremely satisfied with the product It‚Äôs a quality product and looks great!  Shipped quickly. One of the zippers jammed at the corner of the opening on the 2nd use....meaning my laptop was stuck in the bag! Thought I was going to have to cut the bag to retrieve my laptop! Finally after working the zipper for about 10 minutes I got it open just enough to retrieve my laptop! Feels cheap in general, but for the price I could have overlooked that had the zipper held up. Another concern is there doesn't seem to be anything protecting the back of the zipper from scraping against the laptop while zipping/unzipping - which will scratch the laptop if you are not super careful. Had high hopes, but I'm returning this sleeve. It's very good and I recommend it I bought this for my Macbook pro 16"". Inside is of the sleeve is very cheap fabric. Its definitely not what is shown in the picture. There is no protection for the corners either. I like the quality of this case. I bought another one but returned it.My laptop is a MacBook Pro 2015 and the 13.3 is a little big but only an inch or so.... The cover looks nice, but it‚Äôs not the right size for a 13‚Äù MacBook Pro.  It‚Äôs too big and my laptop slides around in the sleeve. I use mine everyday and it fits in my book bag. I am rough on my technology and I bought this for my new Mac to allow it to be protected. It is easy to carry around on its own, or in a bag, I am very happy with my purchase. As requested very good size and soft on the inside for minimum possibility of scratches. Extra pocket was exactly what I needed. Great buy. The color is different than in the photo - it‚Äôs much lighter. Fits a 13 in dell latitude 7400 perfectly. Enough room in the pocket for the chargers, puck adapter and VGA to HDMI adapter in the front pocket with room to spare for a few more small items like a phone and charger. Well suited to just put in my bag with the work I tote back and forth to the office. Wanted something small that would fit in my work bag so it was one less thing to carry. Can‚Äôt  speak to the water resistance as that has not been tested. I received the wrong color. It‚Äôs a similar color but now my laptop hard case and soft carrier case don‚Äôt match. Bad in quality. Not worth the money"
52,"Magic Bullet Blender, Small, Silver, 11 Piece Set",Home and Kitchen,"This was affordable and doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of the counter space! I‚Äôve had two of these in the last 4 years. Both motors are crap‚Ä¶ not buying a third. Literally just put the second one in the trash‚Ä¶ it cant handle frozen strawberries?? Used it 3 times and it died on me. Very disappointing.Waited an hour and it started working again. Very weird. Okay so the blender is great! The cups however drive me insane. They topple over so easily. I have literally spilt a smoothie pretty much every day. I don't understand the design of the bottom. I have never had a blender with blend cups like this. I really just wanted to be able to make a smoothie and go but now I have to put them in a different container so more to clean up. ‚òπÔ∏è Preface: This is the second magic bullet I've owned. The first one I bought at a second hand shop for $4, and it lasted about a year (what I would expect) It worked great, I got a lot of use out of it. Easy to clean and simple.The Problem: Eventually I started to miss my morning health smoothies, so I ordered this magic bullet 11 piece set. When it arrived, I excitedly opened the package, gave it a wash, and put it to the test. The result? 10 seconds and it overheated, stopped working, and began emitting a horrible chemical smell. I let it rest (and put my barely blended smoothie in the fridge while I waited) for about 30 minutes. I came back to it and it began working again, but the same thing occurred. I've now had the product for about 2 weeks, I've used it three times, and all three times I've experienced the issue. And before you ask, yes, I did try different power outlets.The Solution: I eventually stopped being lazy and decided to put the unfortunate added work into looking into this problem. I reached out to Amazon customer support, who forwarded me to the Nutri/Magic Bullet customer support. Magic Bullet customer support was less than helpful. After about 15 minutes of questions, and requesting I send them proof of purchase, they finally concluded that the blade on the machine was defected and they would send me a new one in TEN BUSINESS DAYS. I asked if I could have a refund as I didn't think I wanted to continue to use this brand, they said no. After that call, Amazon gave me a follow up call. They offered to send me a new blender as long as I returned my old one. What a hassle! Now I have to drive down to the local UPS store and deal with sending the thing back.Overall, I once had a good experience with Magic Bullet. But this time, I did not. My suggestion to someone looking for a cheap blender is to consider another brand with better customer support. Every day use, very easy to handle and easy to clean, use for all types fruits and milk shakes . This product is so much easier to use and clean than a large blender. Can‚Äôt recommend this enough, especially if you like to make smoothies for one person often. It's good for fruits and vegetables Can not blend walnuts or almonds well. But add some water or milk will be ok. Generally,  for this price, it ok My mother in law wore her original one out, so I got her this as a replacement. She has no complaints and no learning curve since she had one for many years. I love it when a product sticks with simple and easy to use. Fine and works as advertised as long as you understand its limitations. Overall, not bad. I use it loads Happy as hell I bought this thing! My sister left a cheap one when she moved back to south Florida. Again money well spent. I've used the Bella personal blender for the last few years because of how well it blended and mixed fruit for smoothies. I thought it worked better than the Bullet I got years ago from Costco. But after going through a couple of motors and several blades and having a harder time finding affordable replacement parts than Bullet, I jumped on this item as soon as I saw it. I like that I don't have to get a million pieces with it. It now blends just as well as the Bella (it has a difference shape cup, so maybe that's why). I also bought the ice crushing blade to handle more frozen fruit and ice. I hope now that it lasts as long as the last Bullet I had (which I gave away to a daughter about three years ago, and who is still using it). I am very happy with the blender, I find if you let it run too long the motor gets louder.  I stop it the run it again. Good made a funny semil at first but not no more EASY TO USE SIMPLIFIED BLENDER. Kinda loud, but quick. Blends most of the ice. Happy with purchase would recommend!! Not a great blender at all. I do smoothies every morning and could not use this due to it not blending my frozen fruit. I was really excited about this but it leaked and the motor got hit right away and shut off.  So disappointed.  Really was looking forward to making smoothies with this This product is great for single servings on the go - one thing, it didn't crush the ice cubes, they got stuck -so I don't put full ice cubes in any more. While persons might say it doesn‚Äôt blend well it actually does. I bought this for granddaughter birthday and the motor burned out in a month after making smoothies daily. It was after expiration of warranty to Amazon . YOU NEED TO SLICE YOUR FOOD INTO SMALLER BITS if you want this thing to blend the food!If you don't do this, then the food just sits there unbothered.Also it broke and i've only used it for a short amount of time!!!!!!!! I think you are better off just buying a regular blender, or risk it if you don't use it very often. This is not good for every day use. The middle piece of the blender went loose and stopped blending within two months of having this! Loud and don‚Äôt chop up ice or frozen fruit very good Used this this bullet one time and it does not work anymore.  Outside of the return window.  I wish for items like this the retun period is longer.  I am going to reach out to the seller to see if they will make good on my purchase I should have listened to the other reviews that said this is much cheaper material and design than the other magic bullet products.  This version is small, very thin plastic and makes a very suspicious smell when used.  I fear it will break and only let the power run for 5 sec bursts. I did not use it for a while. It overheats quickly. Just burned today.Will try another product. It works but it does not have much power. If you run it for a little while it will give a funny smell when blending. It works out by out better tha an the one I have Disappointed when blending frozen items- it has a hard time and the motor overheats and smells. This blender overheat so quick can‚Äôt handle cooked chicken breast. I had two stop out already because of over heating. Also, it released burning plastic smell when use over 30 seconds. Runs a bit slow and takes time to crush even some spices.  Comes with only one blade which is not so good.  Main thing is the base heats up quickly. Worked great for 3 months then stopped working. I was making a smoothie an smoke came from the unit then stopped working completely. It was fine for 3 months but eventually died, not thrilled especially for the price.Just sits in my electronic scrap pile, until its either recycled or a replacement is sent but i doubt that will happen!  Just buy a Ninja blender we have our third magic bullet motor blow out. customer service was nice and replaced the second one (I didn't call about the first, I just got another one). but now the replacement blew out. I'm mixing a smoothie, not cement. convenient but it's a little too small for a Daily Harvest smoothie with adequate milk to make sure the motor doesn't blow. Curious if the more expensive Nutri bullet would work better. I only used it three times and it broke after that.Disappointed. Broke to easily after few uses I had a bullet blender years ago but I guess  they've down-sized them since then as this one is weaker and smaller than what I had.  This bullet blender seizes up on frozen strawberries and has trouble other larger frozen berries or items like ice cubes. The blending power for grinding ginger and garlic despite first chopping it for ease of blending. Perfect for smoothies, iced coffee, and shakes. Mixes well and extremely fast. My last bullet lasted for years. The new one I ordered is really quiet and cleaning is a breeze. So worth it! One of the weaker blenders I‚Äôve owned but I was looking for something small and this fit the bill. Works well enough for smoothies, but if you‚Äôre looking to blend frozen fruit or anything other than soft food items I wouldn‚Äôt purchase this. I dislike that sometimes you feel like is not working I was hoping for more of a ninja type of blender, so this wasn't up to my expectations. But, that is only because I was under the wrong impression of what I was getting. It good for smaller blending jobs. Perfect for quick smoothies, although it took a few times of adding more liquid to get my frozen fruit to blend. But overall, it's good. I got it to make smoothies and was super disappointed, it was just sloppy chunks of everything Easy to use and clean. I don‚Äôt feel like the blending power is great. Had to stop, remove from blender and shake the cup to get it to blend completely when making a smoothie Not powerful at all. Unless you do berries, blending an apple and celery takes TIME and efforts. We barely used it and suddenly stopped working. This has been a time saver. Great for making a sauce or perfect size for a blended drink for two. Thanks. I am a daily smoothie drinker. Last week 2 months after purchasing this machine I made a smoothie for lunch and smelled a burning smell. Then the blender stopped. I reached out to Amazon support and trouble shot some things and they sent me a code to return the machine. I ended up buying a more expensive brand. If you enjoy smoothies I would invest in a nutribullet instead! I suddenly had a problem with peanut butter banana smoothies. This has made feeding my cravings so easy. This blender was the ideal one that I wanted to use to make everyday smoothies. For the first month I used this product it worked well and blended what I needed it to. However, after one month of use this blender's motor gave out while operating. I knew because the bullet literally smelt like it was on fire.This was a waste of money and I am NOT HAPPY and I definitely DON'T RECOMMEND! it doens't blend frozen strawberries and I have to keep interrupting my blend to shake the cup to ensure everything is being blended. I‚Äôve been wanting to get one of these blenders for a long time simply because of convenience. I finally went ahead and purchased one and used it at least 2 times a day, sometimes 3 for smoothies for exactly One Week Before It Died on me. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was working it too hard. I would stop it every little bit to mix things up so the motor wouldn‚Äôt get ‚Äútired‚Äù and it seemed to be doing great! My favorite part was the fact that it was suuuuch easy clean up and took up next to no storage space. I didn‚Äôt want a big bulky blender because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt want to mess with hauling it out and taking it apart to clean it multiple times a day, so this was the perfect solution and I was super happy with it.I will be contacting the company to see what they can do about it‚Ä¶I‚Äôd give it another chance if they replaced this one. Perhaps I just got a lemon, which is what I‚Äôd like to think because I absolutely loved it otherwise.So, in a nutshell‚Ä¶This product worked great for smoothies for ONE WEEK and then it bit the dust.  :( Great smoothie maker. Wish they had sealed caps Was unable to blend all the ice in my smoothy.  Took a long time and left chunks of ice while This my 3 one a buy and it doesn't last long At first I loved this blender to make smoothies. I used this blender a handful of times and this morning the blender stopped working and made a funny noise and smoke started coming out from it. Waste of mo ey I'm just going to invest in a better blender. Takes a little longer to do ice other than that I love using it. This thing is so loud, I hate it. 2 out of 5 stars because it blends 2 out of my 5 weekly smoothies. I had my old magic bullet for a decade, and it finally gave out. Replaced it with this newer one, and it sucks. Not a big fan of chewing my kale in my smoothie, but this thing can't blend it, soo.. Not to mention I've used it 5 days/week for 2 months now, and it has smelled like burning plastic every single time. Needs more power The functions are pretty good, however,  the noise is pretty much a problem. When I blend protein or liquid, its fine. Once I add some fruits or frozen vegetables in it, its kinda noisy. So I have to use it in daytime. Smallest than it looks and cups are small; for this price you can get larger one at Walmart. Maybe not the best but super easy to clean and use Love the bullet. It grinds well and does so quickly. Worth the price I love this product the only problem is if you use it to make a couple of smoothies the motor will overheat and you can‚Äôt use it for a while‚Ä¶."
53,Master Lock 8143D Bike Lock Cable with Combination,Sports and Outdoors,"What are my options? Buy a new lock or obtain instructions from maker? I need your help. I have not used the lock and I need it. I really, really don't like this little lock. The little numbers are SO small and hard to turn -- until you get the lock open, at which time they all instantly rearrange themselves into a different combination, so you have to fumble about while trying to get the thing back together. I have petite hands, but this thing makes my fingers feel huge and clumsy and bumbling. Good lock for bike, but you cannot change the original code and if you YouTube it you can learn how to open it without knowing the code. Very cheaply made. A kid litteraly broke the lock in half and took my son's bike. Poor quality Looks much thicker and stronger in the picture... It literally fits in the palm of my hand... Guess that's why its so cheap... Too risky. Would probably break in half if you tugged on it. Way too thin and flimsy. I sent it back for a refund. Someone‚Äôs gonna easily steal whatever to try locking with this. good price but do not use this to secure your bikes since this is very thin and very easy to cut through . Total junk my son took his bike to a festival and it was stolen I really got what I paid for.  I'm using this lock to secure ladders in my storage area.  Its clear that this lock can easily be forced open.  I needed just a deterrent and would not suggest this lock for something of real value. I have been using this to lock up my bike but the combination lock is made of plastic and would probably break with one hit of a hammer If you put this on your bike, you're just taunting thieves to steal your bike.  If you lose your bike, it's your fault.  I don't know what the censors found objectionable before.  Maybe it was because I explained how you could open this in under a min with simple tools, I don't know, but even in general this is a pretty poor excuse for a lock.  The lock mechanism isn't very smooth and feels like it may fall apart any minute.  Plus, the plastic on this wouldn't last one summer outdoors where I live.  The reason I'm not returning it is because I don't plan to use it as a bike lock and how I plan to use it is more for show than anything and I won't be using it that much.  I can't explain more than that. Hard to read, too lightweight My bike was stolen on the first day I used this lock. The thief had no hard time cutting this. It never said you could say you can set the code so I just assumed it was like most of their other combination locks and you could. You can and have to use the code they send it with. Because of the tight coil I couldn't get the cord to stretch as far as was necessary to get the opposite end into the lock. I should have either bought a longer coil cord or just a straight cord lock. I am using it on my 150 quart cooler I have in the bed of my truck, surely it is only a deterrent to a sub honest person. I hope that if someone sees it wound through the cooler handles, they will not want to destroy the cooler to take it. Any cable lock is subject to bolt cutters, that's just fact as I saw many people complaining about bikes being stolen. You can buy a bolt cutter in any hardware store, big box store or here on amazon. I say fabricated because I cant understand who would like this lock, it jams constantly, the numbers don't line up to unlock so you have to jiggle them to find a sweet spot, and im pretty sure I can cut the lock with my fingers, that's a hyperbole obviously, but yeah pretty weak, unreliable, and inconvenient. I would give it  negative 5 stars if I could lmao I usually use my bike to go around my campus and other places around. These places are considerably low-risk areas for bike theft. So, this one works for me. But the lock is very thin and it looks like it can be easily broken. Also, it has fixed lock numbers. So, you cannot set the lock to your desired numbers. My final verdict, this lock is inexpensive and works well in areas with low risk for bike theft. If you live or bike in more theft-prone areas, I would not reccomend this one. The code it came with does not work. I had to buy a different lock. I had my bike stolen when I left it out overnight with this. It was pretty flimsy. It was nice to use when running into a store but I wouldn't use it for longer term secure storage than a few minutes. You do not get to use your own numbers.  Once I locked it together I could not unlock it.  I wasted twenty minutes trying to open it with the provided numbers.  I had to cut it off! Is OK If you are looking for a thick bike lock don‚Äôt buy this. I would never use it to lock up a bike. I have a motorcycle cover & using it for that. It could be cut very easily. Preset combination, nice keychain with the numbers on it, but 4 digits is easy to remember.  Cable is strong, 4 feet is OK, would have preferred a 6' but gets the job done. So tiny is a joke LIttle on the cheap side.  Numbers get stuck and you have to muscle it to open it often.  Pay for what you get There were absolutely no instructions on how to use!! Ok Great for bike lock Thanks !! Good deal..! This product was great for the first few times I used it until I was biking to a near shop and tried to lock it up but it got jammed I tried so hard to open it but it wouldn't open when I got back to my house pliers still didn't cut it off my bike. Also its very oily and it doesn't stretch very far its long but doesn't stretch. I would never buy this product again. Really low quality compared to the Walmart one Good simple lock. Only issue is I lost it. If I don't end up finding it soon then I will definitely get the same one from here! Definitely useless as my bike was stolen the first week I used this lock on it Excellent Product Really. Works well for its intended purpose. Walmart ones are better than this at Sam's price. Lock edges are rough, and hard to adjust Bought this to lock my kids bike in the bike storage room. While the number lock was a good feature - due to a nearby bike, the joint near the number lock broke and the cable lock was rendered useless. It took a lot of hard work to remove the cable and release the bike. Would not recommend for its weakest point - the joint near the number lock and the chain itself. Not even a month and it broke while taking it off The numbers are really hard to align... annoying if you are bending over trying to get it out of the wheel All cable locks can be cut, but this one would not even require heavy bolt cutters since the metal cable is only about 3/16"" diameter.  And, you cannot change the combination!!  Who wants to memorize another random combo that they provide??? works great Cheap and you get what you pay for.  This was a waste of money.  You cannot reset combo numbers.  This will keep nothing safe.  I‚Äôm sure you can cut this lock with a pair of scissors. Does the job. Disappointed in the fact that this lock has a fixed combination. This was not clear from the packaging. I now need to go through the effort of returning these locks and purchasing new ones. In addition these locks don't seem to be strong or reliable. A standard lock with nothing special. I wish you had the option to change the combination. we are getting ready for the camping trip, with 4 bikes on the back of the car, we definitely need to secure lock them just to be safe. Glad we saw this special deal. was satisfactory Very easy to use & sturdy. I‚Äôm impressed for the price Hard to unlock. Works well. Does rust. Be careful if it is hanging off your bike the plastic rubs off over time. (E-bike expirience) pretty cheap, but its cheap.  As described probably, but woudnt buy again,  would pay more for a better product Someone clipped right through it, now my bike‚Äôs gone. Spend the extra money and get some real security Works great and easy to operate Easy to lock/unlock, came with a keychain that has the code so I can‚Äôt ever forget it, and the length is great, not so long to be worried about someone breaking through it, but long enough to get through the wheels to secure the whole bike. Tiny lock. Didn't realize how small it would be. Guarantee if someone really wanted to steal your bike, a pair of bolt cutters would cut right through this. Works for my needs as I live in a pretty safe neighborhood, but if you are really worries about having your bike stolen, invest some actual money in a good lock. Otherwise, easy to use, though the locking mechanism itself seems kind of cheaply made. Only had it about a week, so we'll see how it holds up. Fine purchase for what I paid though. Lock works great.  Downside is that you have to use the code they provide you and it is very thin.  I wouldnt lock up a very important bike with this.  But you get what you pay for. Buy a proper lock if your bike is worth money but this lock is perfect for my daughter's $10 craigslist bike. very rough operation As advertised, though I didn't realize that the combination can't be changed. Great for the price, I'm using these to store Burning Man bikes, not for every day use. Be aware, you can not change the combination on this lock. It is set at the time of many actual and comes with a little metal tag telling you the combo. Master does make one that is customizable but this is not it. It works. Our kids each use one of these to lock their bikes at school but the tumblers are hard to turn in the cold and after 9-10 months, it rusted enough that they are very difficult to turn and it‚Äôs hard to put the lock together. Shopping for a new one now. i have had a few locks over the years.  My normal concern is that the cable is to thick and heavy to carry around on a bike.  I know the thicker the cable is the harder it is to cut it and steal the bike.  Lets be honest, the cable and lock is more than adequate in 90% of the cases if it has a decent cable and combination lock as it scares away the average person trying to steal your bike.  The thicker cable one are to heavy and inconvenient to carry on your bike as you ride.  This Master lock is good length (4 ft) . good thickness and light weight.  SO the reason i gave it a low score is that it gives you a password and no ability to change.  We all have your favorite password and having to memorize a new one for a one off transaction is wrong and enough to make the return it if i cannot get instructions on how to change the password.  I have never seen for other locks the inability to change the password.  I am hoping i hear from Master on this issue on how to change the password or i will be forced to return the lock - to bad as i think this is a good one otherwise My only wish is that you could set the combo. Smell bad Works great!üá∫üá∏ü¶Öüëçüèª WORKS GREAT EASY TO USE Got a new very expensive Thule kayak rack and have been worrying about how easy it would be to take.  This lock is long enough to lock it to the roof rack so even if it was unscrewed no one could take it anywhere.  I wish that I could adjust the combination myself but that‚Äôs my fault for not reading the description.  This would be a very nice feature to add. This lock was cut and my bike stolen within 2 weeks of using it. It does exactly what it should do. Locks and unlocks. Not worth it someone stole my bike because they‚Äôre easy to cut. I guess worth $4 and nothing more I use it as a bike lock. Cheap lock, hard to use This easy to use lock is great I bought it for my backyard entrance, and it‚Äôs broke after 1-2month. Some drug addict p.o.s. clipped my lock and stole my bike within the five minutes I left it alone and locked up getting ready for work. Never use it in the night. It can be broken by hand! Ordered one. Received it a couple days later with combination attached which would not open locked. Returned it. They told me to keep it and sent me a new one that works fine. To the old one in the garbage. New one works good. Not as heavy duty looking as it is in picture. But good enough for 6 or $7. Also locking mechanism feels a little bit loose. Wouldn't lock up nothing very important. But it should deter your common Thief Just what I needed!! Cheap deterrent not very theft proof The lock is ok, but it comes set with a preset combo and you can't change it to something you'll always remember. It's also kind of hard to close the lock, you have to make sure the combo numbers are perfectly lined up to close it. It is a lot shorter than it looks. Nice little lock...I use it to secure a small radio to the bicycle.Works for me Simple, cheap bike lock..as expected My bike got stolen the second day I love it, nice product  üëå Tag declares that it's coated with substances known to cause cancer...so if you want to wash your hands after every time you use it, go for it. I won't use this on my bike because it doesn't appear very strong. What is the point if I can not change the combination of my locks? I bought 2 for our bikes and when I used, month later, way pass the return eligibility, that the locks are not changeable. It is my stupidity to trust these locks to be changeable. I can't remember the code for bikes that I used may be once a month. I suggest Master Lock change their models. I was sent this lock with a label on it with the code. That code was NOT the right code. Didn't open. There is no customer service number to help. Waste of time I didn‚Äôt like this lock. The length and weight ok. However the lock feature is not good. It has only up to #6 and you‚Äôre not able to set your own password. If your favorite 4 digit password has a number above 6 than you won‚Äôt be able to use it. Even if there was digits up to 9, your still not able to set your own. If you loose the password tag that came with it, then good luck with finding the combination by trial. In overall, not satisfied with the item. It‚Äôs a great lock for the price! The part that locks is plastic... easily able to yank off. Despite the brand, it was cheaply made. Buy it if you want your bike stolen. Decent lock but seems to stick sometimes What you pay is what you get. This is very cheap lock and basic features. It is not good to lock pricey stuff but you can use it as extra security. love these Bike was stolen the same week i bought this lock. Theif cut through quickly and quietly. Not able to set own combination. Perfect for what I needed and a great price Does what it's expected to do, good quality should last.  I plan on using them at the gun range to lock my stuff down when I go down range to put up new targets. Don‚Äôt like curl in cable Not seemingly very sturdy.  Could be cut by a number of different tools, it seems. Works for my kids bike at his elementary. Dont even think to lock up any decent bike with this anywhere. I could cut it with a pair of scissors. It's Okay. The wire and the combination lock are a bit filmsy. when i let it on my bike and rain pured in on it, it started to jam.Edit: my bike got stolen ..this was so easy to cut that no onexception noticed it being cut if you have an expensive bike buy and a 5 star hardness level d lock if you care about your money....sigh Length could be a little longer. Other than that, I like it. The lock is just a cheap lock it works fine but I guess I didn't pay attention, or I thought all these type of cable locks could be reset to your own combination but NOTE: THIS LOCK HAS A PRESET COMBINATION AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT. From the beginning, this lock was difficult to couple and difficult to open.  Then one day, it would not open after using it for a couple of months ago.  It is junk. nice, could be a few inches longer The lock won‚Äôt open!  Fresh out of the box with a pre set combination that DOES NOT WORK! Does what I needed it to do Great lock for the price My bike was stolen easily out of my apartment complex's parking garage by a kid with bolt cutters. I should have known better than to trust this lock. It's cheap, don't expect much Not that good .quality is compromised . Though while using it . This lock was much smaller than it looked in the picture.I used it ones and the end broke off.you get what you payed for but just don‚Äôt bother Excellent lock to keep my bike safe Got this and another brand- this one is thinner and can't be reprogrammed with your own code. It will do the job but I'd spend a bit more to not have to remember a code and for the added deterrent of a thicker cable. Nice until bikes were stolen. easy to cut I guess. Haven't used it.  Instructions are in Chinese. It‚Äôs like a toy lock A well-priced, sturdy, efficient and handy bike lock. Verry poor quality lock.The cable is wound so tight it keeps snaping back which hurts if it hits you Master lock is a classic.  With that price it is recommended."
54,"Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Multi-Use Concealer, Fair, 0.2 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)",Beauty and Personal Care,"While I find it is a pretty good under-eye concealer, I don't like the 'sticky' residue at the cap. I fell for the hype and bought both the light and the brightener. They are horrible. They end up dry and flaky even after putting on eye cream. It also settles into fine lines immediately after applying it. Not enough coverage Product is nice but the application is messy This is really a difficult product to use. It came with no instructions on how to get the product to release.  I think I'll cut off the the spongy part and try cutting it open with a set of pliers. It helps fade brides look from surgery but does not completely cover. It is okay because it is less noticeable Been using this for years. Covers perfectly and is easy to apply either sponge tip clings onto dry parts of my face and makes me look cakey. I don‚Äôt think it covers well at all. It could be how well I did or didn‚Äôt do on apply it. Never used anything like this before. This is so hard to get out of the container!! I saw the arrows to twist the top and I have done this many times. It‚Äôs terrible! Boy! This product has decreased in size by 75%. Product was fine I just where very little bit of makeup and not what I exactly wantes Can‚Äôt get it to come out of the container- so really can‚Äôt say how it works or spreads. It is easy to spread & sheer!! I was a little skeptical but I felt the price was right. I could not be more pleased. So long dark circles! I wish I had ordered this sooner. And it's not heavy. Highly recommend. Thrilled with this product!  So much so that I ordered a second time to make sure I didn't run out.  This is the first concealer I've found that covers without caking, hides dark circles and moisturizes without being weighty.  Please don't ever discontinue this product as it's currently manufactured. I‚Äôm Puerto Rican so alittle dark and this is most likely made for Caucasian skin hard to blend and look natural even just under my eyes just to light for my skin other than that good product I have slightly more sensitive skin than the average person but i have given up on using this. This concealer burns my skin so bad everytime i put it on my face. The color is pretty and appears to work like its supposed to but it's just not for me. Great product coverage is great It goes on nice and as soon as I spread it out it becomes patchy, its not easy to spread and is VERY drying! Its good for covering up blemishes but I use it under my eyes and its hard to get an even coat even with tiny brushes It‚Äôs ok. Didn‚Äôt cover my two little age spots. But it would work well for you lighter discolouration a I suppose. The coverage is nice and all but it uses up really fast. The lid is too tight and was unable to use the product easily also the sponge that is supposed to spread the cream falls off easily making it very hard to useWaste of money and vwry poor quality I purchased the neutral for my undereye circles. Mine are terrible. It does not work well for me. It looks like good coverage but it's way too sheer to hide discoloration. It's best to conceal minor spots and to use as highlighter. The sponge applicator doesn't work as well as an older one I owned. It's definitely worth the price, but better for younger people with less discoloration and slight darkness and puffiness around the eyes. My eyes are sunken in so this makes me look worse on bad sleep mornings. I may try a different color to see if less transparent for eye circles since I can use just use it as light concealer and eyelid primer. This does not apply to the skin very easily.  by the time you have blotted the sponge on your face several times it has almost removed what you were able to get out.  Does not remain on the skin either. Na This is a really good makeup.  Covers really well.  Very blendable.  My only problem is it's not very much.  I usually can get 3-4+ months out of my makeup and I've had this a bit over a month and it's almost gone.  Not sure if the spongy tip is absorbing it all or what but I would expect something that I only use under my eyes to last a lot longer than this. Not sure if I received an old one or not; have used this in the past many times, but this was extra thick, wouldn‚Äôt spread and just cakey; a MESS I initially loved how much coverage it provided!! But after 3-4 times of using it, I noticed nothing was coming out. The applicator stopped working. No matter how much I twist or push on the sponge part, no concealer comes out. So disappointing. I wanted to love this.. The first time I used it, I had to turn many times to get it on the sponge.  Everytime I use it I have to turn it several times.  I gave it a try, but I wonder when it is near the end of liquid, how much will be left in tube.  Will not get it again.  I will go back to a tube that it squirts out of. Covers when first used but does NOT stay. I have a lot of dark spots and I can not completely cover them.  But I'm old and maybe don't know what I'm foing This is crap. You can‚Äôt get any of the make up to come out. Sort of streaky and foundation absorbed it after one layer. It could be the bottle but you'd have to add multiple layers for it to come out decent. Doesn‚Äôt last long, I put this on one side of my face and a different product on the other to test it, and this product didn‚Äôt last long at all. Not to mention it looks cakey once it dries. The bit at the top breaks off really easy too. She likes it. My go-to concealer :) Sheer and covers bags under eyes very well. I recommend this product. This is my second purchase of this item, as i thought the first time it was my bad luck and i got an empty bottle, this time is the same issue , whatever hard i press nothing is coming out only very little traces which does‚Äôt make any difference, i will not make a third purchase to be sure , i got an idea two times already !! And excessive pressing on around eye sensitive skin is not good and cause damage and wrinkles. Spreads easily, covers every nook and blends well Will buy again...good coverage... Didn‚Äôt cover the dark circles under my eyes. I would not purchase it again. The foundation works well the applicator is awful! It gets dried out and cakey and soaks up all the concealer before you can apply it. The pump doesn't work well at all.  You have to push it down really hard for anything to come out. And its dry on my skin Didn't like at all Goes on so smooth, perfect texture, excellent applicator.  I will buy this over and over.  Highly recommend if you need to cover up those spots under your eyes, or just want to brighten up your eyes. This concealer is the best! It covers better than any other I have ever used, is non drying without being greasy, does not settle into lines, lasts all day and the application is effortless I honestly have not used or purchased another brand since my first purchase of this product several years ago. I am never without a spare! Do yourself a favor and give it a try. I have learned that products reasonably priced can be superior to so many over priced makeup items on the market that do not deliver.Yes I  love this product!! I found this to work fairly well, for the price point, but the ease of spreading was not quite to my liking. It was thick and dried fast. Be sure to apply to one small area at a time and use a moistened beauty blender to work it in to level of desired coverage. Be aware make sure you read every detail in description because they make it look a lot bigger than it is obviously I know by the weight if I was to really look at but it can be deceiving this is a very small it is awful it will not come out and is to thick I‚Äôm 84 years old and have been needing a good ‚Äòcover‚Äô under my eyes for a long time. Thanks, Maybelline  Instant Age Rewind you helped me a lot. I like this cover up. It goes on very smooth. I only wish it canceled more. It takes more than I would have expected Hard to open I was looking forward to using this under my eyes to hide the dark circles under my eyes.  Initially I was pleased,  but before I finished applying my makeup,  the concealer disappeared.  Perhaps if I had set it immediately with powder, I would have had different results. It doesn't work for me at all. my favorite! It settles into pores.  Not good for mature skin, unfortunately. It‚Äôs okay. Everyone is different tho. It does not do what it says For me it is one of the best concealers on the market, not only for the price but also for the quality of the product. Concealer by Maybelline perfect Not a favorite. Too thin for my dark circles. This stuff works great‚Äô I use it around my eyes. I have allergies and my eyes have them the worst. This brightens me right up.I use bare minerals around the rest of my fave they go togynicely. Cheap, stays on about 5 minutes, poor coverage. Best product for lightweight coverage I‚Äôve ever found.  Love the texture, packaging and ease of application It won't come out of sponge. Can I exchange for a new one? I don't wear makeup all that often and went to use it and it made dents in my fingers trying to get something to come out but nothing did. This product does not absorb well into the skin. I always have to add some moisturizer to it. Product seemed somewhat dried out- not easy to blend/spread. Flaked off easily after application. Not good for small area coverage.  Goes on too thick and dries to a chalky finish.  Color was good and seemed creamy enough when first applied. Not happy!! It's like white out with a sponge tipProduct  doesn't  come out easily.  I tried  tapping  on my face  but no success! Not sure what else to do??I will look for another concealer or maybe remove the sponge? I use this for dark circles under my eyes it just doesn't spread good. Feels like it sits in wrinkles This is a under eye concealer and it didn‚Äôt work.  My foundation works better then this product. I bought this because it had rave reviews about the coverage and how amazing it worked compared to other products. Really sold me.‚Ä¶ No. Very basic. You can get this coverage literally anywhere. The diffused applicator helps but honestly doesn‚Äôt work as well as it states bc the coverage is soooo light. I would just use any cover up and a sponge over this and get the same look. Super disappointed. Love it! Great coverage and easy to apply! I wasn‚Äôt even able to open it. The container felt very very light and I believe it to be defective. I was excited to try it. Favorite concealer I've tried as far as the feel goes. It's so creamy. I took off one star because even the lightest color is too dark. Stick with purchasing from the store! I typically love this product and was trying to save myself sometime by ordering here but the product I received was chunky and unusable. Unfortunately they don‚Äôt take returns so save yourself from wasting money and go buy in the store! The coverage was good for such a light feeling product. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs full coverage. It‚Äôs a medium coverage with a light silky feel. I would buy again. The eraser sponge doesn't fill with the liquid no matter how many times I twist the top. It's barely damp with the concealer. I have plenty of other concealers that work way better. This concealer is a no from me. Excelente producto üëç Feels and looks really thin for dark circles. Imperfections on skin dies cover up. A little goes a long way! I found this to be drying hardly a good product for the eye area, also clumped not smooth would not recommend. There is something in this that REALLY bothers my contacts (like it‚Äôs coating them with oil). I wear rigid gas permeable, so it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs just that type? I wear it under my eyes (as most people do) and by the end of the day I‚Äôve had at least one issue where it‚Äôs been necessary to remove my contacts and clean them. Easy to use.  Matches my skin color. I dislike everything about this product,the makeup didn't even come out... It terrible!!!!! Great coverage and doesn‚Äôt leave area applied to dry.  Recommended I was so excited to try this because it had great reviews! When it arrived, I ripped open the packaging... and then read the ingredients. 2 different types of parabens. I was bummed and debated using it anyway, but ultimately gave it to a neighbor who wanted it. This is a good alternative if you do not want to use your more expensive products on a daily basis.  I use this if I am just running an errand or not doing anything ""special""  Definitely does not cover your dark circles completely. very easy to use..i didn't have reaction on my sensitive skin... Its a dry consistency. Waiste of $ It's the right color for my skin tone but doesnt cover up dark circles well I normally use a Garnier under eye concealer, but it has gotten really pricey. This Maybelline under eye concealer was half the price and had great reviews. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 compared to the Garnier. The Garnier goes on like silk and blends in slightly better. The Maybelline is a bit more milky looking; it just doesn't blend in quite as well. However, for the price I will use the Maybelline for everyday and the Garnier for special occasions. The foam applicator doesn‚Äôt work well. The coverage is very thin and not long lasting. Will not buy again. It‚Äôs easy to spread. But i don‚Äôt think it helps ur skin looks smooth MINUS ONE STAR !!!!!! How is possible to make such a lousy product ?????? I like this because it is easy to spread and leaves a healthy glow.I would prefer more coverage some days. 3 different shades I went to Walgreens to buy a darker shade, none provided any coverage at all it made my pores look bigger after blending on my face I'll be buying it again BUT it isn't that easy to spread, it isn't really moisturizing and it isn't that sheer. So if that is what you were looking for then find something else, but I personally like this. Kind of thick and difficult to spread! Bought this product about 5 weeks ago and tried to use it today, nothing nada turn left turn right push pull upside down, nada. Was very difficult to get the product to come out to HUGHES. I would not buy this again. It didn't cover my circles and it settled into the fine lines around my eyes. Disappointing. makes my skin look old (im not old) would not recommend. i would rather show off my undereye circles than wear this concealer... As a career woman for 40 years, I would never have used a drug store product on my face. No, ma'am, I was a Dior girl all the way. But after retiring, I could not justify spending the cash on cosmetics. So, after reading some ""4-5 star"" reviews, I decided to try Maybelline foundations, concealers, and powders. Am I glad I did! They are wonderful, and yes, comparable to high end brands. Cannot say enough good things about their products. This is by far the best concealer/foundation I have ever used. It covers acne scars and under eye circles beautifully. I actually just use it under my eyes, and on acne spots before applying powder. Looks like a full coverage job. So happy with this purchase and it‚Äôs always exactly as everyone says in reviews ... amazing in every way!! I hope they never stop making it. The color HONEY is my favorite amd I have medium skin with pink undertones because I am English. Didn't blend as I wanted. And possibly purchased wrong shade so be careful there. i was a litle slow and didnt know how to use it but you turn the purple part left a couple times and then you rub it on you and the fluffy part turns into the color you got"
55,Mens Digital Sports Watch LED Screen Large Face Military Watches for Men Waterproof Casual Luminous Stopwatch Alarm Simple Army Watch,Computers,"ok The screen scratches so easily. I couldn‚Äôt remember how I even scratched it. Everything else is great about the watch but that screen will scratch instantly. So I rate this 3 stars because all the features work but after the screen scratches it‚Äôs close to worthless to me now, I don‚Äôt wear it as much anymore. It is made of plastic and it bothers me if I use for a long time. Disapointed. World return it if I lived in USA. Pretty simple, however it kinda irritates my worst a little bit, however for the price it‚Äôs a good watch This watch is cheap and can‚Äôt be read with out turning on the dial light even in daylight. You have to look almost straight to the screen. With some angle the display is no good. You would see 88:88:88. I would spend a little bit more money and buy a name brand for quality.. It got slightly wet from yard work, lens  fogged up, never cleared up. I've purchased this model several times over the past few years. The last two watches didn't last very long before the waterproofing failed. The last one lasted a month before water got into the watch . I swim 2-3 times per week. I've had two of these.  It's a good watch but the band doesn't last two years.  It seems ridiculous to replace the band of a $15 watch.  The band costs more than the watch, if you can find one that fits.  Like I said, I've had two.  It's just wasteful to throw away a perfectly good watch every 19 months or so because the band breaks.I'm going to spend a little more money this time and try to get a watch that will last longer. Watch cracked and face ring broke within one month.  Watch was easily viewed and I liked the large face, but it did not last long. I had the watch less than 3 months.  Moisture easily seeps into the case. The digits disappear . . . until itdrys out.  Then the pin holding the watch band fell out while I was cutting the lawn today; now I can't wear it onmy wrist. I just threw it out.  Ya, I loved the size of the digits (for a couple of months).  Junk! Bigger and clunkier than you might expect. Reset button stopped working in a couple days. Unfortunately wasn‚Äôt waterproof - just swimming! Not worth it. Meh. Face piece fogged up and had drops of water inside. I‚Äôm fairly certain that this watch is ‚Äúused‚Äù, likely a floor model or return.  Small but noticeable pin-size knicks on pkastic face, and small, multiple scratches on metal backing. Low price watch, that seems to work well, so I‚Äôm not going to pay to return... The watch does indeed look the way I expected it to, sleek, sturdy and easy to operate. However,  for some reason,  I have had to reset the time over 20 different occasions because it changed without pushing any buttons. I just fixed the time again right before I started writing this review. Well, kits not waterproof.  Not even close.  Wore it into a pool on August 21, and it filled with water in about a minute.  If you buy it, don't dunk it! watch is functional. I use it for workouts. It's better than the apple watch imo because it doesn't time out. the only thing I think is annoying is the random beeping sound that happens sometimes when I'm using the stop watch. not sure why it does that and how to turn it off. Oh and its good for nothing else, unlike a smart watch. Quite uncomfortable for long periods of time Works as advertised and keeps accurate time BUT will spontaneously reset to Sunday, Jan 1, 1PM every now and then.  The frequency of occurrence of these resets is about once every 2 weeks.  So it's a great watch if you have a more reliable timepiece handy.  I did not attempt to contact the seller to complain - for $12 what do you expect? I was happy with the look and function of the watch. The only problem was that the watch caused a rash to appear on my wrist under and nearby the watch. Bought two of these. Plastic cover very light weight and cracks with low impact. Will return the second one."
56,"Microsoft Surface Pro 7 ‚Äì 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB SSD (Latest Model) ‚Äì Platinum (VDV-00001)",Computers,"I may need to return to update this review.  The Surface Pro 7 I received has a flash problem: the screen keeps flickering and sometimes goes blank before reappearing.  I have contacted Microsoft Support was told to visit their website for instructions on how to fix.  I take that as ominous because there are enough concerns for them to post instructions.  The MS instructions did not help so I contacted Amazon and they have sent me a new computer that will arrive in two days.  High marks to Amazon, less so for Microsoft.  I am hopeful that the new computer will work correctly.  We'll see.  My suggestion: buy the insurance with the purchase, just in case ..... I've had this computer for a while now. At first everything was golden, but now not so much.Pros:This computer is the perfect size for someone on the go. Its compact, but still has a decently sized screen for getting work done. In general, the computer is fast, the face recognition login is great when it works.Cons:There are many issues with the software or hardware, but I don't know which since I'm not a computer expert. The volume controls constantly freeze, so the volume is unable to be adjusted by any means until the computer gets restarted. There is an issue where the curser constantly freezes, but I can not tell if its the computer freezing or the mouse controls. As mentioned above, the face recognition login is fast, when it works. There have been many occasions where the face login stopped working randomly until the computer is restarted.I don't know where these issues are coming from, but they can make this computer a pain in the butt to use. Additionally, to maximize use of the computer, I highly recommend the keyboard cover, a pen, and a mouse. DID NOT COME WITH THE KEYBOARD. I was under the impression that it included the keyboard for this used price. Should of went elsewhere.  Ive tested battery life in the mean time and it was below a typical refurb. The Surface gives me what I want. The pictures that were given, showed that the Surface had a USB C port but the surface that I got has a mini displayport instead. I checked and found out that Surface Pro 7 don't have mini displayports, I was sent the wrong Surface Pro."
57,Moto G Power | 3-Day Battery1 | Unlocked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/64GB | 16MP Camera | 2020 | Black,Electronics,"The 2GB is too small for this phone although the processor is powerful. Most background apps will be killed when you switch to another app. The camera is not good especially at night. The photos are not clear because of focus. You may need to install the google camera. Great price - stupid phone.  Battery life is above average.  WiFi function is average to poor.  Limited USB function and no HDMI out.  This is the only phone I have ever owned where you have to tell the USB port to activate.  The digitizer is not accurate.  The camera is crap.  The speakers are above average.  The screen is not brilliant enough to be seen outdoors.  For $150, it's worth every penny. I purchased this phone for my wife who had an old iPhone that was glitching. She absolutely loves this new phone with its larger display, fast processing speeds, and vibrant colors. She loves how you can shake the phone to turn the light on without having to login press several buttons when you need a light quickly. The only problem we have found it that this phone does not support WiFi calling with AT&T. I wished we would have known that as we live in a rural area with limited and weak signal. The only option for us is to change carriers.What carriers is my moto g stylus (2020) compatible with, you ask?Check the chart below to find out more about the carrier compatibility of your moto g stylus (2020):AT&T  Compatible & supports VoLTEVerizon  Compatible & supports VoLTET-Mobile  Compatible & supports VoLTE, WiFi Calling, Video CallingSprint  Compatible & supports VoLTE, WiFi CallingBoost  Not supportedU.S. Cellular  Not supportedGoogle Fi  Compatible & supports VoLTE, WiFi CallingRepublic Wireless  Compatible & supports VoLTE, WiFi CallingCricket (AT&T sub-brand)  Compatible & supports VoLTEMetro PCS (T-Mobile sub-brand) Compatible & supports VoLTE, WiFi Calling, Video CallingTracfone (GSM)  Compatible & supports VoLTETracfone (CDMA)  Compatible & supports VoLTEConsumer Cellular  Compatible & supports VoLTEDefense Mobile  Compatible & supports VoLTEStraight Talk Wireless (GSM)  Compatible & supports VoLTEStraight Talk Wireless (CDMA)  Compatible & supports VoLTETing  Compatible & supports VoLTEXfinity Wireless  Not supportedOther MVNOs on Verizon's network Compatible & supports VoLTEOther MVNOs on AT&T network  Compatible & supports VoLTEOther MVNOs on TMO network  Compatible & supports VoLTE Make sure to order the 2020 model if still available. The 2021 model is actually a step back in quality, in both screen resolution and audio quality.And about that screen. It's gorgeous. An unbelievable buy for the money. Add Dolby stereo sound and you've got a winner.The processer runs quickly and smoothly as well.The downside is the camera quality. It's not bad, but it leaves a bit to be desired. It'll remind you your using a budget phone every time.And finally, I take issue with the much trumpeted battery life. Three days ? Hardly.It's still pretty darned good, but I've yet to see it last more than 24 hours before needing a charge. Perhaps I got a bum battery.But, all and all I highly recommend this phone. There's no better buy at this price point. I chose this phone because it had great reviews for it's camera and it's battery life.  My frustration is with the inability to store and access the pictures I take on the phone.  It will not allow you to store pictures to an sd card and you can't access the photos from the DCIM file.  I do not want to store my pictures on Google, but that seems to be the only option.  Battery life is not much use if you can't use the phone for anything more than texting, calls, and web searches.  I had a Samsung Galaxy phone before this and was frustrated with the short battery life, but honestly, it was so much easier to navigate that I will be returning to Samsung. One week after purchasing it, I was sitting on the floor and the phone slipped from my pocket. No more than 4"" high, still cracked the screen.The phone is extremely slippery. sometimes it's hard to keep it in your hand. If you place it on ANY surface that is not completely flat, it will just slip and fall.The sad part is that I'm still waiting for a case I bought to arrive. I wanted a quick inexpensive Android replacement. This phone worked great.But after 90 days it hung on a black screen and got very hot. That usually means battery.I had the battery replaced. No good. So I got another one. It works great...so far. i really love this phone. great features.. great price I think the phone would have been great. But no matter what I did it would not work with my carrier. I asked ahead of time. Was assured it would work with new sim card. It did not. Threw away $248 on nothing. This is not a very good phone we ordered two and both of them have problems intermittently and all the time lots of software issues Anne just a cheap phone just exactly what you asked for I wouldn't recommend this phone unless you're planning to throw it away after about a month I bought as a replacement phone for my Samsung J 7, which had only 16 gb storage, and quit recognizing the SD card. The 128 gb in the Moto G stylus give me much more ability to do what I want. I set up the fingerprint access, but then deleted it because it was more difficult to open the phone, plus I don't really need the added security. I'm still getting use to the differences between the Motorola and Samsung features. So far so good. I've used and have a number of Android device, and have been using them since Android 5.0.  This is by far one of the best value devices on the market right now. Liked it so much I bought a second one for my son. Works as it should. Returned unused no review able to be given. 3 phones later and endless hours on phone with service provider none would work properly on Verizon  don't waste your time It is very clear to read. It takes pretty good pictures.I Hate where the mute button is. It is on the screen exactly where your thumb goes when you pick it up.Once it is muted, you can't unmute it. You have to hang up and call back. When you are talking, the volume goes down. Purchased as a Christmas gift, microphone went out by April. Easy to set up and a good little phone. Not bad for the price, but sometimes, the touch screen is really frustrating....you cannot even open an app or scroll up and down....Updating my review:Downgrading from 4 to 2....touch screen is a serious problem... imagine that you cannot use an app when you need it the most...example: not being able to call for emergency when you need it... I don't think that this was a new phone!!! Great product, excellent price, great battery life. By far, the best value for the price. Item was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with Verizon but wasn't upon taking it to a Verizon store to have activated had to return Love the phone, I've had it for a little over a year now. It's my favorite phone so far (I tend to buy lower cost phones and this meets all the marks for a good, quality phone experience).Pros/Favs- size (I love big phones with a bit of weight)- BATTERY (its everything, I get 1-2 days and don't worry about charging it to the date)-  price point for features- headphone jack- call qualityCons- a bit of freezing (might be due to NOVA launcher not being as compatible) here and there (started happening around 7 months, but still fine phone experience).- space (doesn't come in any larger 128+ sizes)- camera (basic camera for photos, but isn't as good as comparable phones in the market - that said, the pictures are fine)- No NFCHope we get another good phone like this from Motorola soon (2021 lines weren't that great tbh). Could not find a case to fit camera oval. Having a few other problems.Hard to get through to support at Motorola.Motorola does not seem interested. May have to send back. Love the stylus for quick, short notes. Camera also works well So far this product has worked very well. Battery life isn't great This phone was great in the beginning. Some things weren't so great like how I had to download an app for everything basic like notes and a step tracker but that's okay. My problem is that I legit had this phone for about four months and it's already glitching. Screen freezing, I got it. Random blackouts, that you cannot explain because your phone is charged and you didn't 'accidentally' shut down your phone, you bet your ass that's there too. Audio going out of wack, definately, and don't get me started on the fire alarm they resort to when a normal song is suppose to to play for regular alarm in the mornings.It takes too long to start up, something this and apple has in common tbh, but my point is, this phone is fully freaking out and I don't know why. The fingerprint reader works when it feels like it and the screen won't recognize anything I type sometimes so there's that too. Woohoo hate it here. I don't even know if this phone offers face recognition tf. One good thing is the battery life. I can go two days of normal usage without charging. and it was 30 dollars cheaper than retail. If you‚Äôre buying a phone for battery life, that is the only good feature.The phone itself is so problematic, you avoid using it and thus batterylast even longer.Drops callsWhen connecting calls very often they can‚Äôt hear me.I dial numbers and get message I can‚Äôt connect but my house phone and wife‚Äôs phone connect right throughMy phone calls customers on its own while plugged into charger.The list goes on This is a scam. This phone is NOT UNLOCKED. This cell phone is perfect my husband used it outside USA international he got cell phone chip worked perfectly for his trip! The videos and pictures are very clear! The fingerprint worked perfect! This phone was used for his trip only! stylus input is sub-par. battery life is pretty ""meh."" they built it so the stylus pulls out of the phone from the bottom, so it's constantly falling out on its own (in fact, i've lost the stylus. last i saw it fell out of the phone in my car.) But the missing stylus doesn't matter much since it only registers about 75% of the touches to the screen with it. Drawing w/ the stylus is a chore because it can't register all points of boxes or circles I'm drawing and lines only complete half-way. trying to write with the stylus is a complete waste of time.On the flip side, it does have a nice camera and if you ignore the train-wreck of a stylus, it's not that bad of a middle-of-the-road android phone. The camera is so easy to use. My two year old granddaughter took pictures of her granddaddy using the camera on this phone. I also love that I can set the camera on smile and it automatically takes the picture when I'm ready. I love the brightness on the flashlight that comes on with just a shake. The speakers on the phone come in loud and clear. After having an LG for years this phone is difficult to adjust to, I don't like the voicemail option, hard to navigate. The local Verizon store, an authorized dealer, was little help. I think this phone stinks the battery doesn't even last all day I can't get the fingerprinted even work but the face recognition does work excellent product and very good Late is slow If you don't want to pay a fortune for a high end phone, this phone is a great alternative. It's great for all of the normal functions, like phone calls (great quality) and texting. I also find it very good for watching videos. The MotoG received high internet praise for its battery power that supposedly lasts for 3 days on 1 full charge and other basic features which for me it didn't work out.So on the 1st day, I opened it up charged it and played with the phone and was pretty lukewarm. It has the nice display, your standard Motorola widgets and interface you would expect and a solid OS.The major problem I came across was the back button if the user wants to go back in a page on a site or in an app. For whatever reason the engineers thought it would be a nice gimmick to swipe back at the top left but the biggest issue is that the screen is long so you need big hands to comfortably go back at ease. It was a painful experience on my hand which unfortunately is the only way to move backwards.The next biggest problem was the charge. For whatever reason it took a longtime to charge but it drained so quickly. I think the product was possibly defective which was why I returned it immediately. My older phone lasted longer than the MotoG.Outside of that, many of the gaming strengths were solid as it looked great and the camera capabilities were decent depending on lighting of course.The overall price of the phone in combination with its features made this phone a solid device however the back button or lack thereof influenced me to drop this phone and the poor battery life as well. Not worth it at all Had for 10 months; in that time I've strained my thumb repeatedly. This device is deceptively large and fooled me but I gave it fair shake. My major grip;  the moto gestures programed into the phone can have you scratching your head why the camera was on in your pocket. Doesn't feel nice when you feel heat on your thigh from the flashlight inexplicably activating... This is my 3rd Moto and it is by far the most poorly built.  The touchscreen is not very responsive, yet manages to open unwanted apps all the time.  The camera lens cracked without any direct impact.  The volume control is poorly placed, requires a lot of pressure, and is in general hard to change to a desired level.The speakers are good though. Had to return it because it did not have WIFI calling. This was important for me as I live in an area with limited cell coverage. Other than that the phone is excellent. Went from a Essential Phone to the G Power. This phone can't be beat for the price. The battery life is wonderful (when screen brightness is not up). Some lag occasionally but overall fast response. Perfect phone if you aren't heavy into mobile gaming. Was not worth my money I am not able to use the phone outside. The display does not get bright enough. I chatted with Motorola support. Ran through some tests. Nothing wrong with the phone so nothing to fix the problem. Otherwise it seems ok, but not being able to see it outdoors is kind of a big problem. Good cellphone for the price. Very nice The most frustrating phone that I have ever owed. It takes three to five tries to return to the previous link. It doesn't respond to you using your fingers to navigate.  Sometimes I have to reboot the phone to go where I want to go. I've owned several Moto phones, this will be my last. Its nice but mine is abit slow and crashes sometimes so it could use an increase in RAM memory or whatever its referred as in the Phone world even though it is unlocked phone but it wont let you turn on hot spot I kind of feel like you need to understand what you're getting into by buying a phone this inexpensive. It works, but it's slow. It crashes a lot. The camera is terrible. The screen isn't great. The list goes on. But I bought it awhile back after dropping my pixel and shattering the screen and needed something cheap. I'm still using it, for now In general I like the Moto G phones. Pros and cons to this phone.As far as the 3 day battery, I can leave it on battery saver for 3 days without using it and have it still at 70%. However, with heavy use it will last 1-1.5 days, maybe less.The  fingerprint reader is iffy and often doesn't work for me.Biggest con to this phone is it's size. It's huge and very heavy. it is much too big and too heavy for my hand. Not only is it difficult to use, especially with 1 hand, but I have actually injured both hands since switching to this phone from trying to hold and use it. Bigger is not better. I'm strongly considering switching to a smaller phone. However, I will note that it is not necessarily but than other brands, including some Samsung phones. Has decent battery life. Just  hassle to navigate through.Too fragile. And difficult to find a case for. Not worth the buy. Get samsung if you want a better over all phone or LG for the asthetic and half the functionality Made the mistake of thinking phones hadnt changed much since 2015, this one was 1 3/8 taller than what I had prior and 1/4 wider.Who wants to walk around with a scientific calculator sized device all the time? Found it too big. The battery life is great and the phone overall works great. over all it's a great phone. Good size and good price for unlocked phone. I loved this phone when I purchased it in Oct. 2020. Worked great. Very fast and responsive. Now, not so much. The phone (not the Wi-Fi) locks (freezes ) constantly. I have to restart the phone to get it to un-freeze. Battery lasts days. Works great. I have not had a cracked screen in years, I dropped this phone on vinyl floor out of my pocket (about 2 feet) and the screen cracked.  The camera does not take clear pictures, it lacks ability to focus despite multiple settings.  It also takes a long time to start/ restart and has frozen on me regularly.  This phone is only 2 months old. It's a good phone works well and great amount of built in memory. Just one down side is the display isn't as good as the Samsung. You have to turn the brightness all most all the way up when outside in the sun. Otherwise it's a great phone. I've had this phone for six months, and the battery is starting to fail. It only last half a day now. I don't recommend this product. The only way this battery lasts 3 days is if you never turn the phone on. I had to download an app killer app because there are 5 or 6 Google programs that constantly run. I use the app killer 3 or 4 times a day to close them. Fingerprint reader works well. My Samsung S8 gets much stronger reception on phone calls. This phone calls break up often.Added later. So far everyone I've spoken to on this phone has told me that I'm breaking up, so I guess it has poor transmission. I deducted a star for that. I had to replace my moto g7 Play and decided to try the Plus because of the camera reviews.  I'm not very pleased with it.  Volume isn't as good.  It doesn't respond well to touch some of the time.  Often the people I am talking to can't hear me very well.  It doesn't want to send texts if anything is going on.  I've only had it a couple of weeks and maybe I'll figure out some tricks but so far not impressed. Work good in Mexico with Tel cell I recommend it Trouble hearing on speaker phone, both ways Exactly as advertised and arrived in perfect condition. Had lot of hopes for this phone, but I am disappointed. I actually own a Alexa enabled Motorola G7 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N92347B/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_776dGbBT1YKK3) that I purchased during 2019 Thanksgiving, and this phone I purchased during 2020 Thanksgiving. So, I do like Motorola G series phone and the value they provide, but this one disappointed for few reasons:1) Media playback doesn't work via Bluetooth  - this is a deal breaker for me!  (For example, you cannot listen to YouTube songs in your car!. Same thing worked for my G7)2) No face recognition3) Not able to change font4) Not able to change Styles  (feature in Moto app that I have in G7 - this allows you to change how app icons look (round, square, boxed) and font selections.Few features seem to be good (when compared to G7) but didn't help change my opinion or decision. Returned the phone.- Camera- Battery performance (but this makes phone a little heavy)I am going back to my G7, wait for another good version in Motorola G series. I bought this to my mom, she loves it. Usually at the end of the day her past phones are almost dying but this has not shown any of this in the months that she has owned it. Went to my service provider to set up my phone with no problems. Barely multitasks while using Android auto I have to reboot the phone at least once a day.  It hangs up quite a bit.  The photos are pretty good.  The  call quality is o.k....nothing to rave about.  Battery life is o.k.  I have been very frustrated with this phone.  The only reason I went with Motorola is we had pretty good luck with our former Motorola phones.  Not sure I would buy another Motorola or at least not this one... Even brand new, battery life is horrible, plus, my sd card became dislodged when I inserted the tray, and I had to wind up returning the phone for replacement and wound up having to give up my sd card which had a LOT of pictures and music on it . The battery does not even last a whole day if you spend a couple of hours a day surfing facebook or playing a game. The only upside is the exchange went very easily. I wish I would have paid attention to the reviews that talked about the battery life or the sd card, as what has happened to me are NOT isolated incidents. I would have rather paid a bit more ( 50+) and not had to deal with any of this. Plus I would still have my memories that are lost with not being able to retrieve my sd card"
58,"NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Epic Ink Liner, Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner, Black",Beauty and Personal Care,"Does not last all day Very waterproof and doesn‚Äôt smudge. Last all day‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Too much started leaking out and I was difficult to draw thin wing. After about an hour it bleeds up onto my eyelid.. I had read a lot of positive reviews, but honestly,  not impressed. The first time I used it, it applied nicely but flaked off quickly. Despite having the cap on tightly, it seems like after the first use it dried up. Great 1st application.  Easy to use. You need some kind of power setting. It still smears on me after 10 minutes. Overall a good eye liner. However, if you use a face lotion or foundation that doesn't completely absorb right away, you may find your eye liner smearing.  You need to be careful opening the cap when traveling with it as it has a tendency to leak out into the cap which will splatter all over when you open it. I have no idea what happened, but I thought this product was absolutely wonderful until the ink was suddenly all over my hands and my counter. Still have no clue what happened.Design of the eyeliner container: 2/5Eyeliner itself: 5/5I'll give it a 4, because I really do like the eyeliner - better even than the Kat Von D eyeliner! This was so easy to put on. And im a beginner again lol. So many years of permanent tattoo eyeliner & now can't find another person that's good to redo them. Had to go back to this. It goes on easily but does not stay on all day.  By the time I get home it has ‚Äòmelted‚Äô off my eyelid.  I‚Äôve used similar products for years.  I won‚Äôt buy this one again .  I do wear contacts but it shouldn‚Äôt matter It is great eventually. I am not great at this yet and it‚Äôs too watery to start. Every time I blacken my left eyeball. It is not for a novice. I have hooded eyes so need a thin eyeliner but this formula is too thin for a beginner. I need to find something else. Didn‚Äôt stay on long. Also I won‚Äôt use it anymore because after 3-4 times the applicator Tip ‚Äúhairs‚Äù separated. It glides on well but it didn‚Äôt last for me. My eyes are watery often, due to allergies and this didn‚Äôt last through any of it. Also, I had to store it with the applicator pointed up because it leaks. Good product especially for the money and wears well. I live in the south, so we have high humidity and high heat. I would not feel comfortable wearing this outside. It was messy, did not apply like it showed in the pictures and an overall bad buy. I wish I had read the ""real"" reviews prior to purchasing. Save your $$$! This is not water or oil proof. I tried it the first day directly on the kids with no primer. By ten it had smudged. It‚Äôs a good eyeliner but it‚Äôs not waterproof and if you have greasy ass skin like me you need primer. Great option for the price. Comparable to my Mac eyeliner Nice hairs on the brush bent out of place Smudge proof, lasts all day. Best eyeliner I‚Äôve ever used!! Will definitely keep buying! I really love this. It goes on super smooth, but it doesn't last as long as I would like, but that's because I use extremely thick lines. Towards the end of the day I have to reapply the thicker parts of my wings. Glides on so smooth! I love it! DO NOT BUY FROM HERE! Amazon shows it as returnable. However, unbeknownst to me, this was denied for return because it switched to a 3rd party seller. This is a knockoff or defective! It looks like black water! Went on very smoothly Eh - I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised given the low cost. But was disappointed it doesn‚Äôt color as dark as expected. Takes about 3 layers (letting dry between each) to darken the color. I wanted to like this liner. The pigment was great, loved the application, but it transfers a LOT. I was only about a quarter way through my 12 hour shift and I had imprints above the lid. Not an attractive look! Bold looking I like this eyeliner; I would recommend this eyeliner to friends. Great price. Not as black or pigmented as Loreal Lineur Intense,  but a good inexpensive liner for your makeup bag. This product did not work for me. Eyeliner was very liquidy and was not waterproof. At the end of the day, I had raccoon eyes. It was awful. Didn‚Äôt last long enough to smudge. When you first use it, the pigment goes on opaque and smooth, yet after a few uses it seems like the pen is already drying up. It could definitely be a batch issue, but I'm uncertain since I bought two. Despite its pitfalls, you can get defined lines with it. The tip is firm but it's soft enough to not cause irritation. This eyeliner is easy to apply, dries quickly & stays put. I would definitely buy again. Easy to apply and stays on without smudging till I remove it. I hate it gets smudged very fast and then it looks bad! I work outside and it smudged, faded and bled onto my face. It says water resistance, smudge proof ‚Ä¶ BS. So upset with ordering this product. I don‚Äôt know how it got such good ratings. It smudged and gave me panda eyes. As expected When I apply to my top lash line (and let dry!) its perfect for about 4 hours. Then starts to leave smudges on my eyelid by the crease, where my lash line hits my lid when my eye is open. It a no. They said this is the best of the best waterproof eyeliner. Sadly, they are wrong. I have a condition where my eyes water all the time and it excited me when I hear of waterproof eye products. I had high expectations, but in the end, it didn't work. Lasted a good 1 hr then, eyeliner started fading or was completely gone. This didn‚Äôt even last 30 minutes. It instantly smudges and smears all day long and gets on both eyelids without even being exposed to sweat or water. It‚Äôs just a bad product. I do not recommend at all! Goes on nicely but wipes off with water. Not waterproof at all and definitely not long lasting. Flakes after a few hours or less. Stays out and goes on easily This is a really good eyeliner, really easy to grab and apply, and it lasted a long time, however; I don't think is 100% waterproof. Bleeds everywhere. Kept upright to avoid a mess once I apply, still poured liquid everywhere. I have been using this product for awhile because it‚Äôs cheap and does the bare minimum of the job. Now I‚Äôm sick of it. The tube is constantly leaking. At first I thought it was just a fluke or defective first one, but EVERY tube I have gotten has ended up leaking. It bleeds everywhere. Take your money elsewhere, or just end up disappointed. Not waterproof, not smudgeproof, and it bleeds. Barely applies on top of eyeshadow too. Anything you could want this eyeliner to do, it won't. Loved how long this eyeliner stated on! Did not budge during a hot outdoor wedding. My daughter likes it a lot she loves eyeliner and need some more so she ordered this. It smudged a little a few times but not much so I think I will buy this for her again. comes out super wet n smears all over Actually, I've purchased these previously and never had a problem. This time, I received a problematic eyeliner. The spring mechanism was way too hard to open on this item. Seemed it suctioned down too tightly, more so than any of the previous eyeliners of the same kind/brand that I bought from this vendor. Upon removing the lid in order to use this eyeliner, the eyeliner would ooze out black liner liquid and drip down the pen and onto the vanity and sink. After beginning 4 mornings of trying to get ready for work after cleaning up the black dripping liquid and also having to begin my eye makeup all over again, I threw this eyeliner in the trash. I sadly got a very defective one this time that hemmoraged everytime you opened it. I was not too impressed with this liner.  I looked great after the easy application but it just did not stay on well. When I received my package and wanted too use it it was dry af not worth it I‚Äôve ordered two. The first one immediately the tip got messed up, the second dried up super quick. I love them when they work but it seems like I‚Äôm gonna have to replace them pretty frequently So let me make this fast. My review is mostly positive, with a catch. So the eyeliner is indeed smudge proof, so that's great. It is also somewhat waterproof and sweatproof. By that, I mean I spent hours outside on a hot day, sweating and running and my eyeliner did not budge. However, I noticed that when the waterproof and smudge resistance were both tested at the same time, ie. rubbing your eye while sweating or crying, the eyeliner fails. So basically, if you're sweating or wet, DO NOT RUB OR TOUCH YOUR EYES! The eyeliner will come off. Otherwise, just lightly dab any sweat or water off your face, let it dry, and you're eyeliner will be more or less unscathed. Overall very happy with the product for the price point. GF likes Not smudge/ where proof smeared off I needed one that would be be easier to apply like this one. Love the liner. Stays on well and very durable. The one issue I have had with the last 2 times I've ordered is that it frays pretty bad. Not very water resistant & have to go over several times to get the black dark enough. Prob won't purchase again. This stuff is smudge proof! Had high expectations but unfortunately not waterproof at all Read a ton of reviews.  Got this to replace my MAC liquid last eyeliner.  It doesn‚Äôt last as others have reviewed.  I use a primer & setting spray and it still fades away by the end of the day. Doesn‚Äôt last on oily skin. It goes on very wet so be careful of smudges initially.  But it dries quickly and then stays very well.  Not water proof but resistance is good. Stays where you put it. Never have those black lines on eye lid Loved this... until it started Coming out in big drops and would run out on everything when I took the  cap off. I had to go back to my stills. üôÅ Not happy with the eyeliner. It‚Äôs not waterproof Goes in flawlessly. It‚Äôs my go to eyeliner when I actually decide to wear some. If I prep my face with even just a wash and moisturizer it stays well for me. Lasts me a good chunk of the day/evening and only starts to really smudge right before or during my sleep when I forget to take it off (guilty of laziness). I don‚Äôt always use eyeshadow or anything else with it but it‚Äôs nice for a eye shadow look or not. After reading many positive reviews, I was excited to try this eyeliner... it arrived timely, so shipping was no issue and once the eyeliner is on, it works as described. But the issue I am having is that it leaks all over the place. I‚Äôve tried storing it upright to see if that might help, but nope. It‚Äôs been a dripping mess every time I use it. Very disappointed. It‚Äôs very easy to use, has a good flow and creates nice lines. It stays in place but will start to flake off after wearing it for an entire day. No problems! I switched back to this after trying some stamped eyeliner, but it burned my eyes so badly, I came back to NYX. So glad I did. I can wear it all day and it never irritates my eyes at all. This came with felt tip feathered and bent second replacement began to feather and bend bristles. It‚Äôs flakey and opaque it sucked False advertising!  Does not last and smudges very easily. My eyeliner came almost dried and i had to use other eyeliners. Also this eyeliner is not long lasting and comes off easily. Also the tip pieces do not stay together and come out. Made my eyes water like crazy and they turned red Of all the eyeliners I've tried, this one really makes it easy to get both eyes to match with a variety of dramatic looks. The eyeliner glides on smoothly, leaving crisp lines. It does take a little while to dry (apply some powder immediately) and its water resistance is only moderate. But the effect it creates compensates for these limitations. Easy to apply.Dark black.Long lasting.Smudges a little if one has oily eyelids that are hooded. I have watery eyes, and this product isn't as waterproof as I hoped it would be.  It does go on very easily, has a very good tip.  If you have a great primer and don't have watery eyes, it might work for you. It works well The line was thinner than I thought it would be... After reading the reviews I thought I might have found something that would actually stay on my eyes. I was terribly disappointed as within 2 hours it was smeared under my eyes and above my eyelids. Would I recommend this or buy it again, definitely not. Be sure to use a light hand bc if you go into heavy you will get a little bleeding of the product bc it‚Äôs thin, but if you adjust to that you can get great well defined lines overall for the price I feel it‚Äôs the best in its price point. I honestly didn‚Äôt have my hopes up considering the price. But I love it. Its long lasting and waterproof. Definitely will be buying again! This makes doing winged eyeliner SO EASY. It usually takes me like 5 minutes to do winged eyeliner but the flexible brush tip and pen like tube allows you to effortlessly draw on your eyeliner I have tried seemingly a million different eyeliners with varying levels of success. This is by far my favorite! I love the fine point and the precision I get with each line. I will buy this product again and again. It‚Äôs very pigmented and has the potential to last all day .. however I have very oily skin and have no problem sumdging this off through the day. Untouched this can easily last all day but the slightest touch leaves me with racoon eyes. When I opened the product, it exploded everywhere. As far as the rest I‚Äôve used, it looks nice, easy to apply and last longing. I also tend to rub my eyes a lot and this eyeliner took it like a champ. I have oily skin and within a few hours, it was smudged all over my eyelid. Love the product This product is difficult to get OFF your skin and you'd better get a good line the first time, but it's a nice ink for eyelids if you get it drawn right at the first try. This is a long wearing cheap eyeliner, and it stays on for long periods of time.  I do notice that by about 8 hours, it fades a bit.  It is also not cry-proof.  I cried while wearing it due to a sad movie and it smudged all over. Best liquid liner I‚Äôve found For me, eyeliner is one of my makeup staples. I wear eyeliner for about 10 hrs a day so finding an eyeliner that does not smear or smudge is important for me. The NYX liquid eyeliner is very pigmented in color but for my skin type (normal to combination skin) I found that it would start smudging after sever hours of use. For the price it's an ok eyeliner. The brush is very precise and glides on smoothly. I like to try out new makeup brands, and am always looking for dupes to the Kat Von D eyeliner. Not water resistant or smudge proof at all...Smeared all over after one hour. Thought I could trust this to be as advertised, nope! Works good. Great! Lasts all day... this will be a staple item for me from now on Leaks a lot and the bristles come off easily...blurs and bleeds every time you apply. Not a good product at all. I didn't care for it. It is not smudge proof, water resistant, or long wearing. It's tough to apply. Not worth yanking at my eye every morning. Stays on all day, I use this for both my eyeliner and the tails of my eyebrows. This eyeliner is very easy to use and gives me those sharp edges and corners I want. Terrible eyeliner. Not sure why there are so many positive reviews. Difficult to apply - very liquid-like formula that is prone to feather-if you have watery eyes be prepared to have to clean it up with a qtip or start over multiple times! I‚Äôve never had an eyeliner that I mess up so often with! By noon I look like a raccoon! Not waterproof! This product is absolutely NOT waterproof!  I can wipe it off easily with a wet finger.  However, it is very black and does apply evenly.  DISAPPOINTED!!! Some of the hairs for the stick We are flared out and I had to cut them off in order to not mess up my wings at the end. Works good but I‚Äôm happy I bought two cause the other one was perfect. Top got more & more difficult to open; almost impossible some days. The top was spring loaded and last week started blowing the top off (!) while it was sitting on my make-up table. Did that several times!!! Finally dried itself out. As soon as my eye teared up all of the eyeliner was gone so I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to see how long it lasted because it was only on my face for maybe a half hour with allergies season this is a terrible eyeliner I have had non-waterproof eyeliners that have lasted longer than this one Clearly states 2 Count in description.Only 1 Count This eyeliner is ok, it's easy to use but after using it for a while the pigment isn't as good so I feel like I need to get a new one even though there's plenty of liquid left. Its definitely waterproof but the longevity isn't great, if you wear it all day it tends to flake off so you'll need to touch it up. I'm someone with slightly hooded eyes and I find that it doesn't smudge at all so I really like that about this eyeliner. One thing I highly dislike is that it's a brush and if you accidentally put the cap on wrong or the brush touches the side, the bristles will be bent which makes it somewhat difficult to put your eyeliner on at times. But for the price it's ok. Product is as advertised, it lasts all day without smudging or melting under my eyes. Easy to use and glides on good but mine is super like, juicy and runs very easily. Good eyeliner!! Easy to use and applies well. HOWEVER, if you have it on especially in your water line and you cry it burns really bad. So if ur planning on crying don‚Äôt wear it :) it hurts. but other than that good eyeliner. Just a regular eyeliner It is easy to remove, and I am not sure if because  I am the oil skin, so it doesn‚Äôt has longevity‚Ä¶And oil skin mix water will make it doesn‚Äôt last long time‚Ä¶ When I first tried this eyeliner, I was pleased! Very sharp, consistent lines. Then, after a couple weeks of use, the tip began to get inkier. Large droplets of pure ink would gather at the base of the pointed tip, and heavily saturate the pen to the point where I had splotches of ink on my eyelids and if I were able to successfully, get a wing out of it, it'd take 5 minutes to dry, which made blinking without mistakes difficult. The pen continued leaking every day, gluing the cap shut and eventually made the cap fit no longer. Would not recommend. Not what I was hoping for.  The color doesn‚Äôt apply if the eye area is moist, but eyes are naturally moist...only applies to outer eye area, don‚Äôt expect to get under eyelashes or at lash line.Also fades, runs, not waterproof.Super sad. It tries but doesn't work for hooded eyes. May work for those without hooded eyes but for me it smudged like crazy. I don't normally write reviews but I felt the need to write one for this eyeliner. I read what others had to say about this eyeliner and it convinced me to buy. IF YOU HAVE GREASY SKIN AND EYELIDS DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!! Application is very easy and effortless but after an hour or so it was all over my eyes and settling in my crease. I kept having to check in the mirror and wipe the eyeliner off to make it look decent. The promise of waterproof was misleading and smeared really easy. I love NYX products and have not been disappointed in the past by their products but this eyeliner is not for everyone. Does the job Does not last long. Smudges , terrible ! Felt tip on both didn‚Äôt last long The price is pretty unbeatable. In a pinch and on a budget, this eyeliner works perfectly fine. Application is easy and for daily wear, it can easily last a month or two.But it does smudge very easily and it is not long lasting and usually requires me to fix it up throughout the day. It‚Äôs difficult to get very sharp, concise lines with this eyeliner.If you‚Äôre looking for long lasting, high quality eyeliner, you‚Äôre going to want to increase your budget. But for the price, this eyeliner can get the job done for the most part. This is terrible. Not a good substitute for the Stila. Yeah, it‚Äôs way cheaper, but not worth the savings. Doesn‚Äôt make a sharp point, so wings look dull and stupid. Smears immediately. Rubs off a ton on the top of the eyelid. Can‚Äôt wear for more than an hour, 2 tops. Just buy the Stila! This eyeliner is sticky when applied and my eyeliner sticks to my eye lid.  I won't buy this again. Thick and lasting eye liner Good liner So, the first time I applied this, I loved it. It had a super fine tip that allowed me to create precise flicks - just like the KVD tattoo liner I‚Äôve used for years. However, when I went to use it the next morning, I found that the interior of the cap has such a narrow hole deep inside the end of the cap, that it split apart the tip of the eyeliner (which is actually made of brush hairs - that in itself seems like a bad idea), into frayed, individual brush hairs that go in every direction. That fine tip is gone and no mater how I try, I can‚Äôt get those brush hairs to conform back into one cohesive tip. I‚Äôm beyond disappointed and it was a total waste of money. Do not buy. After a couple weeks of using this I had to change my 4 stars to 1‚Ä¶ Tip starts to completely split or fray causing lots of makeup mess ups you end up having to fix. Don‚Äôt waste you money. Doesn‚Äôt apply smoothly. I've been using Kat Von D's Tattoo Liner for a couple of years and while it's very solid, finding an inexpensive dupe is what I was aiming for. Nyx's eyeliner sealed the deal for me and actually applied a better line to my eyes than the tattoo liner. However, after a month of using this the felt tip developed a tall like feather and it wouldn't go down so I had to repurchase. Hopefully I don't experience that again with this repurchase! Bleeds like crazy, takes forever to dry, any thought of eyes watering makes it smudge and smear. Would not recommend. This is a great eyeliner. You can get a thin or thick like snd it doesn‚Äôt flake. This actually stays on! I wear contact lenses and others get funky or flake and make it impossible to wear. I love this brand! This stuff flakes off pretty easily, which is a shame because I was really hoping it would be good. You have to go over some of the lines more than once because the pen doesn‚Äôt leave a good solid line, and it feels crunchy almost, sometimes you take the other eyeliner off with it. You get what you pay for Doesn‚Äôt stay long, started to fade within 3 hours of apply. Love this liner. I work in the heat and it stays The longevity is pretty good but the brush did not stay in tact very long. I usually use NYX products, though some of them could have better quality. This is one of the Nyx products with bad quality control this brand has a lot of problems unfortunately and at least its easier to order from Amazon than directly from them. Goes on smooth Not completely satisfied It does last during the day, and doesn‚Äôt seem to smidge badly; but it does wear off in places throughout the day, so the line isn‚Äôt clean and sharp like it started out. It‚Äôs ok though, I‚Äôll use til it‚Äôs gone and get something else After a minute of putting it on, my eyes start burning. Not suitable for sensitive skin. This stuff sucks! I bought two and after one use they‚Äôre severely frayed I can‚Äôt even use them anymore save your money and buy something else The only eyeliner I will buy. It lasts 24+ hrs and doesn‚Äôt smudge. It doesn‚Äôt come off when I sweat either. I‚Äôve slept in it and woken up with perfect wings if that gives you any idea. My only complaint is that the tip will fray, no matter how careful you are putting the cap back on. This doesn‚Äôt get in the way of doing eyeliner, it‚Äôs just aesthetically annoying. I use this eyeliner daily and it stays put, doesn't smudge and is my go-to for all occasions. This eyeliner was a disappointment! It‚Äôs certainly waterproof but bleeds when applied making it a mess to correct. On more than one occasion while I was lining my top lid, in the inner corner of my lid, it bled right into my eye. It also feathers, too. It seems like the product doesn‚Äôt regulate flow in the tube, so if you store in life side down it over saturates the tip. I‚Äôve been using this type of liner for years and never had these issues. I went cheap and it showed. Try Clinique or Kat Von D. It‚Äôs worth the money. This does not stay on, within an hour it's already coming off. Lasted 3 hours Drys out very quickly not worth it I love the deep black color and the point is easy to work with however it said it was waterproof and it is so not anf prone to smudging It‚Äôs VERY thin and watery. Bleeds everywhere and over all makes a mess. For a cheaper brand it didn‚Äôt disappoint like some of the higher end brands have. I actually choose to use this one over my $40 liner. NYX has come a long way! I usually love this eye liner but this one came leaking. As soon as I opened it I noticed a bead of black forming at the base. I can‚Äôt use it without beads of black liner dripping. Tried to get a replacement or refund but it said not eligible. I‚Äôve had the product for a short time and it‚Äôs already coming apart and it smudges alot"
59,"Nautica Voyage By Nautica For Men Eau De Toilette Spray, 100 ml",Beauty and Personal Care,"Scents good Delivered to  I incorrect residance Gave this to my son as a gift and the sprayer in the bottle is broke and laying in the bottom of the bottle after a couple uses. It's ok but wears off quick. Useless. Doesn't worth the money. I purchased this product by good faith of the 12,000+ reviews with almost five stars. This product is awful!!! Unfortunately we can‚Äôt return it. I am beginning to really wonder about amazon reviews and how legit they are!!?? This is the WORST smelling cologne! Nothing pleasant about it. Buyer beware! This product has NO SMELL TO IT!!!! None! I only bought because of all the reviews. I do not understand how it got so many good ones. It doesn‚Äôt smell good or back, there is nothing to it. Like spraying water!! Just wrote Amazon an email hopefully they let me turn this no return item!!! Horrible Was not that smell my boyfriend remembered it being The scent is strong but fades quite fast. About 2 hours later, don't really smell it very much. But actually happy that this one has a half life that's so short.. I think I would be really tired of the scent if it was any heavier and stuck around all day. Enjoy I personally just do not like the smeell. Jeremy Fragrance brought me here ü§£ I genuinely love the smell, but it doesn't seem to last very long and can be rather easily overpowered by other scents around you. Even a little bit of sweat seems to wear the smell away. Changed my review.... Smells great at first but wears off fast.... Disappointed! Cap is broken on arrival. I thought it would be a clean fragrance. Smells stale. It does smell great when first applied, but not for long. Scent lasts, well, for about an hour. After that it drops off sharply. To rule out my just going nose blind to it, I tested it out with multiple friends & family members. Results were consistent, good for an hour or so & fading to nothing within 3 hours. I genuinely believe this to be a fake. 5 star longevity cause I cant get the smell out. Holy moly dont buy cheap cologne! Nice scent, doesn‚Äôt last that long though. My dad loves this. The scent is very nice Not bad but wanted something stronger The scent lasted for a long time on my body even when I sweat. It smells good and does its job. meh Super upset because when I got the bottle the product was half gone looks like it was leaking No good The main reason I purchased this product was because the price was right.  The scent is OK, but not one I would pay a lot of money for. My fiance can't smell it after an hour. Not can anyone else. Cancel my subscription I like. First time buying this. Just give it a try. But it‚Äôs really turned out good will buy again It was a gift. You'll smell much better Love the smell only lasts as few minutes Scent doesn‚Äôt last but when I do smell it, it‚Äôs amazing. Just wish it was a longer lasting, but for the value can‚Äôt beat it I received this, sprayed it and automatically knew it was a fake. It‚Äôs been diluted with rubbing alcohol, atleast that‚Äôs exactly what it smells like. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it because it seems like a lot of people received fakes too. What a bummer, DO NOT BUY THIS. You will be dissapointed. I can‚Äôt even wear it anymore because it smells like I‚Äôm just spraying rubbing alcohol on myself. It smells very nice. But in my opinion does not last long enough. I usually spray on my clothes, even that does not last long maybe two hours. On the  skin very short period of time. I can definitely say I noticed immediately the scents not nearly as potent as my last bottle from 3 years ago. This products made in spain vs my older usa bottle. Its still a pleasant scent that brings the coast to mind but youll use more. It‚Äôs ok. Too strong if you don‚Äôt like a flowery smell. Worth the price Happy with the product this does not I repeat DOES NOT..smell like the one i would get back a couple of years ago, the smell of this makes me sick and gives me a headache like nothing i ever experienced. This should be illegal because its dangerous. It make it hard to breath, like some comments say it smells and has the effect of sniffing strong rubbing alcohol! Smells like rubbing alcohol, doesn‚Äôt even stay long. The smell comes out in no more than 10 mins. I did like the scent but there were some note characteristics that I wasn‚Äôt too fond off. Overall a great cologne for the price. I would recommend nautica blue though. Would have given a 5 if the scent was more to my liking. I just love how mild  the smell like a fresh out of the shower type of cologne I enjoy when I receive compliments on the scent. This happens often. Frankly, this is the best reason to use Nautical. This cologne dont smell more than 5 mins waste of money Smells great and the scent is kinda strong so u only need to spray it like 2-3 times so it lasts a while Smells pretty good, does not last long. Hadn't bought a cologne in a while. Got a few compliments! Not bad, not that good. This is a very pleasant scent. It's not strong and over powering but gentle and mild! It's ok but I prefer the original Blue nautica after trying this. Its just  blue water I smell like a dad now Perfect smell After applying to under shirt and outer clothing after 15 minutes my nipples and chest area started burning (I didn't apply directly to skin) and also the left side of my neck, I've never experienced this before. My girlfriend hated the smell, and the lid leaked. Cologne I purchased is defective. It will not spray. Pump is Defective. Amazon will not accept returns on cologne. You have been warned. Clinique for men is the way to go. Good fragance but it dies away too fast. It lasts less than 2 hours even when you are indoors I received a counterfeit product. The fragrance is way too alcoholic and not pleasent. i wouldnt recommend it Not what i expected but its good all the same Sent fresh wow this is literally 1 second worth of smell in a bottle and even then the smell is very weak. guess the reviews was right it literally smells like fresh grass I love that smell I don't like the Smell. Smells really good and it‚Äôs very lasting Must of gotten the cheap one cause this does not smell good at all . The smell is very harsh and strong. Does not smell pleasant When you buy a perfumery product it should say something about the smell I mean there should be sence of some kind of relativness. Sorry this product says nothing as long as a good smell is concern. Not so strong of smell, does not last long neither.Maybe for work is this decent smell if you keep puting on during the day. It has a light smooth smell for everyday wear has a light smell like the ocean for a good price What fragrance? None at all. I mean combined with my smooth talking and the cologne I'm getting more booty than toilet seats Good scent Its an everyday perfume , nothing strong. Value for money Its pretty good, nothing special Great product for price üëçüèæ It does not stay for long. The Smell is good. Have to use a lot of it to stick for a few hours also. over the top bottle Not for me but most people like it.  I usually don't use cologne, but all of a sudden I'm interested in buying colognes again after many years of not using them.  I read all the reviews about Nautica Voyage and it got high ratings and surprisingly for a cheap price.  But I tend to like sweet smelling colognes.  This colognes just didn't do it for me and I gave it away to a friend.  Most men love it, but I didn't.  Chances are you will love it, especially for the low price when compared to other colognes that cost so much more. no bad Like all Amazon's Chinese products ESPECIALLY fragrances,  you expect a year & you you get a month. It's just ""blah"" in my opinion. It doesn't smell bad, but there are MUCH better scents out there. But it at least smells good enough that I will still wear it to work. I had high hopes for this one, unfortunately it's more annoying to my nose than it is pleasing. Maybe it's not for me. The smell just gives me a headache. At least I gave it a try I got this for my son for xmas.  It has such a great scent to it for a man. Nice smell. Good value. I honestly have to if feels as if the product was watered down. Just okay wasted my money this is fake  its like applying rubbing alcohol to myself Super aroma I bought one from this perfume before this one but fron different buyer the 1st one better than this one Excellent product and a good price. Smells nice and an overall solid cologne.My only problem is that it doesn't last very long. Other than that this is a pretty damn good cologne. 4/5 Did not like the smell‚Ä¶It was very strong It smells great! Thought I'd try a different scent since i like other Nautica colognes. It smells nice and lasts long. Shipped fast and undamaged. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that the pump is a little funny and spritzes instead of an even mist or spray. Besides that i like it and i would recommend it. Overall i am happy with this purchase. Last long and smell great! I have bought this cologne three times over the past four years. The first two times I had no problems, nice clean scent for a fantastic price. However the third bottle (purchased November 2018) has a very weak scent and almost smells like rubbing alcohol, if anything. Maybe it is just a bad batch, but this third bottle wasn't even worth the low price. Needed something and bought this based on price and reviews. It smells like cucumbers. It‚Äôs an awful fragrance and I‚Äôm bewildered that anyone likes it. Bought this for my husband not knowing what it smelled like at all. But it smells wonderful on him. I was extremely pleased just ok Don‚Äôt buy smells gross like a cheap cologne from Walgreens ! Lovely smell, stays on all day unless I start perspirating. Can't beat the price. Very happy overall with this cologne. Very pleasant fresh clean scent. Excellent value to price ratio. this  Nautica voyage  is horrible  potent stuff three days later still smells on  your shirts Cheap version of what it used to be. Scent is faint. Plastic top instead of metal one seems flimsy. I‚Äôd look elsewhere for budget cologne."
60,"Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Water Gel Daily Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin, Oil-Free, Non-Comedogenic Face Lotion, 1.7 fl. oz",Beauty and Personal Care,"Nice moisturizer.  It‚Äôs light and smooth and does not leave any sticky feeling after it‚Äôs applied. Love the feel and smell The smell is horrific! Smells of a  cheap powdery scented feminine pad you get from one of the dispensers in a public restroom.I cannot imagine keeping this on my face. ü§Æ Love the feel, the way it moisturizes, especially with my extremely sensitive skin. It makes my skin soft but it burns. I Have only had this for 24 hours so I will have to update later. So far this has left my skin super  soft and smooth I have been breaking out really bad and I have started a new skincare regimen. This product was highly requested and so far I love it. I have oily skin around my nose so though it is very moisturizing it leaves my face feeling fresh. I thought the container looked pretty small but it is a good amount of product The box came all beat up and slightly open from the bottom. When I opened the jar there was no seal. I don't trust it. I love the actual cream. I think I'll just buy it from the store from now on. Great effective product! I've always preferred and loved Neutrogena products over Clinique, but this product let me down. The Clinique Moisture Surge (clear pinkish gel) doesn't burn at all, and that's even putting it on my eye lids. The Neutrogena didn't nearly absorb into my skin the way the Clinique Moisture Surge. I'm not fragrance sensitive, and this has a pleasant odor, but it is strong. I like the smell, but don't like the burn on my skin. I might actually return this product. Too much scent. I prefer the other version of this that is for extra dry skin because I can use it day and night. I battle extremely dry skin,I applied this lotion every night and morning,my face doesn't feel as dry as it normally does.But I prefer a more moisturizered in winter,not this one. This used to work for my husband fine but for some reason after awhile it stops moisturizing. I didn‚Äôt like how thick it felt and sticky and the color is bright blue Product was not sealed!!! I‚Äôm not sure about this cream. It is very hyped but it didn‚Äôt work well for me. Made my skin itch/tingle right after use for some time, but it did make my face feel more supple. When I got my package, it looked like the box has been through a WW2, and somebody opened it couple times. Also the Gel container itself, when I opened the lead, didn't have any plastic or some other second protection. Maybe that is how it's supposed to be, but it sure does look suspicious. I don't have any complaints with the products itself, its good! Plumps way those fine lines while it‚Äôs on, not that moisturizing though, good for oily skin, dried fast, scent is a little strong. Don‚Äôt get it in your eyes though. tatcha water cream is just more moisturizing and balanced if you have combination skin, I was hoping it was the same for less, it‚Äôs not but the closest I have tried so still a good value if you are on a budget felt like giving my face a drink!  lightweight I‚Äôm not a big fan of it but works alright. I admit I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative to the wildly overpriced Moisture Surge, but this is not it. Why In the hell does this garbage have so many good reviews??? Haven't you people ever actually had quality face moisturizer? I bought this because I was sick of paying $40 for Belif but I immediately regret buying this as a replacement. Don't do it ladies. Had to go to the doctor,  not normally sensitive or allergic but had a allergic reaction. Did some research and it maybe the lot.Lot number is L24420WD1Would appreciate a refund! I can't fathom why they'd add a scent, and so much of it, to this product, especially since it's supposed to just sit on your face overnight. Have been using it for a month but haven't seen any results. I feel like it's gotten worse! I love it hydrated my skin Feels wet and softens face for application of makeup. Buyer beware. This is not the true product. It was repackaged and replaced with something else. Very disappointing. I will cancel my monthly subscription for this item. NOT for dry skin. Absorbs nicely. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Light fragrance. Add a serum if you want deeper hydration. This product basically burned my face and caused it to start pealing. Did not feel moisturized at all. Would not recommend. I am 40 and have struggled with oily skin all my life, a co-worker suggested this lotion and it has been a saving grace! Hardly have oily skin any more and I know longer struggle with dry skin! This product works well as a light-weight moisturizer. It‚Äôs great as a day-time moisturizer during the hotter times of the year. What I don‚Äôt love and why I‚Äôm switching to a different product is the fragrance. I find the smell very strong and unpleasant. I also think the product is over-packaged with its thick plastic container containing a very small volume of product. It‚Äôs not eco-friendly and I would prefer supporting companies that consider sustainability. This is great for your face if its dry. My face drinks it up!It is the best! Good product in unsafe container. It needs a protective cover to be safe and prove that no one has put finger in it before shipping especially in coronavirus time like this. Non greasy and absorbs well.  Perfect daytime moisturizer.  Feels cool and smooth when applied Super hydrating, with no greasiness, melts into the skin leaving a refreshed feeling. The scent is amazing too. Love it I love this moisturizer-- it goes on light, not greasy, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.Usually I purchase this product from a local retailer and not through Amazon but I wanted to save myself a trip.Well when I opened my box it was clear that the protective plastic wrap had been partially peeled off, the neutrogena box containing the jar was ripped open on the side, and there was no cap inside of the lid.  Into the garbage it went, along with my faith in Amazon to send intact products, not someones return. Disgusting.2 Stars because shipment arrived on time and the jar looked authentic.Buyer Beware, you could be getting someone else's return. I like the texture and way this feels on the skin and it absorbs super quickly, which is also very nice. I have an oily t-zone but dryness on my cheeks and forehead and find that this doesn't provide quite enough hydration for me. Once it absorbs into my skin, my cheeks still feel a bit dry. If I put oil and serum on first, then this locks everything in, but on it's own, the hydration isn't enough for me. Sadly only got hydro boost 0.5 ounce with the sample box the other items were not in the box like it should be don't know if this is a amazon issue or not The hyaluronic acid does wonders for my skin. It is silky and blends into my skin- no greasy feel! I didn‚Äôt like the thickness of this product but it is very hydrating. I opened the box and took out the jar and when I carefully unscrewed the lid the product was very loose and ran out onto my dress. It did not moisturize my face at all. I felt dry about 2 minutes after putting it on, no matter the amount I used. Maybe if you have oily to normal skin it may be good but even the slightest bit of dry skin, try something else. I like that it is not sticky once applied, but it has a very strong fragrance. I wish there was a fragrance free version I have never had sensitive, dry, or acne prone skin.  This product dried my skin out and caused very small pimples.  I used it about a week before noticing the effects. this is great. very nice to use on both your face and legs  really moisturized Did not meet my expectations I wish I could get a refund The description at the top of the Amazon page states that the product is fragrance-free and dye-free. When I opened it, I saw that it's blue and has a fragrance. Both the blue dye and the fragrance are listed on Neutrogena.com's info on this product. See below. I would not have bought it for my sensitive skin if the description had been accurate. I will return it.Ingredients:Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1 I'm not sure if my skin needed this product. Didn't see a change or difference. Not sure if this Elmer's glue in a different bottle but it‚Äôs nothing like the Neutrogena daily hydro boost. Stay away if you have dry skin. This product claims to be fragrance free, but fragrance is listed in the ingredients and is very strong upon opening the container. I attempted to still use it, but my sensitive skin reacted poorly after a few applications. I like the Hydroboost line, so wish this was actually fragrance free. Smooth silky, clean finish. Keeps skin hydrated. I use daily the day time version and night time moisturizer. It is just okay. It smells exactly like the hydro boost sunscreen which my sensitive skin/nose did not enjoy. It dried fast but it seemed to dry on top of my skin instead of being absorbed.  I heard great things about this product and was disappointed.  For reference,  I usually use the Peter Roth Cloud Cream moisterizer and will stick with it. Liked that it was easy to spread although it‚Äôs thinner than I‚Äôd like, so when the jar tips over, the cream goes into the cover. Not a big deal but xcept when traveling. Seems to moisturize well. I cannot remember a time my face was flaking so much. My skin is dryer than back before I used face moisturizer at all. I was finishing off with my second jar which I bought both from Target. So I decided to buy my third jar from Amazon. Guess what, I think it‚Äôs fake. The smell are terribly strong of chlorine. The one I bought from Target printed Made in Canada, this one doesn‚Äôt say where it is made in! I don‚Äôt trust this to put on my face so Im returning it. ! I admit I have only used a couple of times. It seems nice and light but the fragrance is off putting. It's very strong. I should have checked for unscented but didn't expect this. This legitimately smells like cat litter and doesn't do much at all for my skin, which gets pretty dry in the winter. If I didn't get a bad formula I am sooo confused what all the hype is about I got this as a present, I don't think that is too expensive but sadly this brand is not cruelty-free which I realize way later after I got this :/ The scent is entirely too strong. You would think for a product made for sensitive skin that it would not have a strong smell of perfume. It also really burns around the eye area and underneath the eye. It does a decent job of moisturizing but for the price I will not be buying again. Disappointed with this product. I bought it because I have dry skin especially in the winter. I have been using this for almost 2 months now and have noticed no change, my skin is actually more dry now..and red which doesn‚Äôt usually happen to me. They also give you such a small amount for the price. The product smells good that‚Äôs about it. Oh well i‚Äôll keep looking for something that works. Doesn‚Äôt work at all. Waste of money It dried my face out even more. This is a good product. Unfortunately the lid was not tight during shipping and most of the product had leaked out before I opened the package which made unboxing a mess. After the cleanup, things got back to normal. I like this product and it does what it says it does. My skin feels much better after use. I will buy this again. The product came really fast. It is smooth and soft texture with cooling effect. What i don't like about it is that the package seemed to already use or open before shipping out to me. It is not like a brand new product. Pros:-Absorbs quickly-Feels light and refreshing-Good for sensitive, acne-prone skinCons:-This is my fault, but I bought the water gel instead of the gel CREAM, so the moisturizer that arrived was the scented instead of the non-scented version. I am not a fan of the smell because it is rather heavy and too artificial for my taste. This product is a scam. Not the real cream, the packaging was ripped and there was no hygienic seal component over the moisturizer. Absolute scam. I love that this moisturizer has no greasy residue at all but it does really burn when you first put it on and I don‚Äôt consider myself to have sensitive skin. not good I do love this but this is NOT fragrance free. Have purchased before and loved but recent shipment had detergent scent. Made me feel like it was not safe to put on skin. Sometimes my skin gets sensitive. When it is and if I put this on my skin then the skin gets kind of tingling. But other than that good quality and good price. Its moisturizing is pretty awesome. I put this on in the morning and night. Even here is dry area but I think it is enough. Love this. It doesn't make the skin oily I like the product , but kind of feels like it's over priced ! The product docent show any improvement made on my face. It smells nice and it's moisturizing but doesn't effect my face in a good or bad way. Not impressed It‚Äôs a nice product. I‚Äôm sure it would work well for some people, but it burns a little when I put it on my face and doesn‚Äôt provide day-long moisture. Won't need to buy this as often as they recommend. Great investment!! I was looking for a moisturizing but lightweight product and finally gave in to this one as a dupe for Laneige. It works perfectly for me! Also it‚Äôs very refreshing üòä Great moisturizer at a great buy I did have high hopes for this product but should have read the reviews more carefully.  My skin did feel smooth when I applied it, but the fragrance was so strong I had to wash it off quickly.  Would be happy to use this if it didn't have such a strong scent. I love how watery, cool and comforting it feels to put this on! It's always been difficult finding products for my extremely sensitive skin, so it's nice not to have my face feel irritated for w/e reason for once! Smells fresh, feels smooth. But it feels like a coating on my face and not a moisturizer that actually moisturizes. I‚Äôve been putting it on over a better product as a sealant type product. It's a fine product, and that's the problem. You want skin care products that enhance your skin, go above and love your face and body. This product doesn't do it for me, it's not excellent it's not horrible, it's just fine. It feels like a waste of time for me and this product if it doesn't do anything to my skin. It looks like an used item.The packaging was broken.There was no seal cover inside. This did not work for my face. It caused a breakout; Honestly, most things do. I now use it on my hands to treat the dryness from hand washing and sanitizer, and it makes them feel great. I enjoy the clean scent. Other than a nice scent, I didn‚Äôt feel it did any positive things for my skin - a total waste of my money. The extremely high fragrance content in this product can be hazardous to sensitive skin It‚Äôs a really good moisturizer, however I started noticing flare-ups. I read the bottle and even though this item is listed as fragrance free, fragrance is listed as one of the ingredients. The title of this product page states that this is fragrance free. I have have sensitive skin. I also am a migraine sufferer and fragrance can bring on a migraine for me. I used this last night for the first time. It is HEAVILY fragranced. You cannot get away from the smell when it's all over your face and neck. I couldn't fall asleep due to it. It made my eyes water and it made my skin a bit red and felt irritated. The product is also BLUE from a blue dye that they add, which isn't healthy. I'm quite surprised about the hype over this product. It's also in one of those glass containers that has really thick walls, making you think there is more product than there really is. Also a waste of glass that just fills the landfills. Exactly as described. great delivery. I have very flaky skin in my ears, it‚Äôs really an eyesore. Was hoping this would do the trick, but it just wasn‚Äôt strong enough. If I apply it routinely for a week, I get some relief but if I miss a day it goes back to being awful.For extreme itch and flakey skin, I think you‚Äôre stuck with the eucarin advanced cream or whatever. It leaves you feeling like you‚Äôve got lotion all over but it is effective.This smells nice, applies well, and feels good but wasn‚Äôt the right product for me A little pricey for such a small amount I have rosacea so I need to be careful. This would be great in the summer months as it‚Äôs not greasy at all. It‚Äôs not moisturizing enough for the colder months. Good for moisturizing. Prefer unscented, but got used to the fragrance.Product agrees with my sensitive skin.  Price is right It made me break out While listed as fragrance-free in the title ( why I ordered it) it has ""fragrance"" listed in the ingredients. I'll give it a try, but if I break out, it is will be returned. I wanted to love this product until I saw they use artifical dye. Specifically blue #1 which has no practical use and I am allergic to. Such a shame because so many people love this product. Would love a dye free version. This product is not good for sensitive skin. I don‚Äôt have the most sensitive skin as I can use most of the facial products. However, I feel the light stinging feel every time I apply it. It‚Äôs not unbeatable but I can feel it.The scent is also very strong. I feel I‚Äôm wearing perfume to bed when I apply it.I‚Äôll probably give it away and buy something else. It really keeps your skin hydrated  and soft , Goes well with the cleansing wash. Must be a fraudulent product. It has a terrible headache-inducing floral scent. I have been buying this product from Walgreens for at least a year and the Walgreens product is scent free. I do NOT like this product at all!! I want my money back asap. I hate the fragrance and it's making me breakout like crazy!! I'm actually allergic to fragrance and cant believe this ""top"" selling moisturizer has fragrance in it. Pathetic. DO NOT BUY!! I really like this product! It‚Äôs very light on skin and it‚Äôs absorbs into your skin very quickly. Even though I LOVE the scent I wish it was fragrance free to decrease any sensitivity. It gives me what looks like a rash on my face and it burns.now that's not to say this isn't perfect for other people who knows why it does that I could be allergic to something in there that I'm not aware of. I'm combination to oily sensitive skin i was super itchy due to the dyes but it is very lightweight Do not buy! This literally will moisturize your skin for about 30 seconds then your skin is dry again! Its a waste of money. It does not moisturize all day. And it leaves ypur skin feeling flaky. Do not purchase. Sorry just being honest. I really liked this moisturizer, my face breaks out easily and is super sensitive but this moisturizer really didn‚Äôt break my face out at all and helped me clear a little bit of my acne. I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a moisturizer to help extremely dry skin on the face! The smell is overpowering! And my package from Amazon did not look like the pictures; it looked messy and like someone stuck their finger in and mushed it around. Weirdest of all, this serum made my skin extra dry and flaky. I read that on someone else's review, but just ignored it. Should have saved my money.. I always meant to put moisturizer on my face at night before bed but never did, until I found this.  I use it every night and I love the way it makes my face feel.  And it dries so quickly, not sticky or tacky.  I have tried almost every moisturizer made and this by far is the best.  I will use this moisturizer for the rest of my life, will never waste my money again on anything else. I am sad that this didn't work. I put it on my face last night and up with my new acne right in the area I tested. I really wish I didn't buy this and want a refund, but I am not sure this is possible. I also did not like the smell at all, it was very strong for me. I was looking for a budget friendly alternative to Clinique Moisture Surge.  This is not it.  It's a good value but I could not get past the overbearing scent.  Also the moisturizing benefits are not comparable, my face was tight and dry after application.  The good reviews left me feeling positive I could swap, but I'll be going back to my tried and true brand. Normally love this product but it arrived open and looked like someone tampered with it I want to start by saying I don't usually like using products from big companies, ESPECIALLY ones like J & J, but I have to admit when my skin loves a product. I was recently on vacation visiting my mom and forgot my moisturizer and had to use hers. I was very nervous bc I have very sensitive skin with rosacea that usually gets triggered by products like this and containing fragrance. I also have hormonal acne around my monthly that was around this same time, so my skin was angry to begin. I feel like someone reading this may think I'm lying when I say my skin immediately, IMMEDIATELY perked up with first use. I couldn't believe over the following week when my skin is usually at its worse, it looked better than it had in years. My 40 yo skin was transformed that week to supple, firmer looking skin that it hadn't been since my 20s(and I've always looked good 'for my age'). I wish it weren't true, but I had to come home and order it right away. I can't imagine my life without it now. Took a star away for being owned by evil and containing fragrance, though I have to admit the fragrance isn't overpowering at all and is quite pleasant. I can see from the ingredients list it could bother some people, so it's not for everyone. The scent of this product is too strong. I don't doubt it's moisturizing capabilities, but  was not able to truly test it out given t I had to wash it off after an hour. The scent free gel is the way to go. Just ok This product is a waste of money, it does not work. I know this is a popular brand. This is got to be one of the worse moisturizer out there. For the price it should work on my dry skin. I had to use so much to get rid of the dry patches. It is light weight, which is probably the only thing that‚Äôs good. Sending back. Trying several new moisturisers.  This is high on my list.  Feels wonderful and a good price. This is a different type of moisturizer because it's a gel but goes on so smooth and makes your skin feel so soft.  Best one for the price. I was actually shocked how hydrating this is. Very impressed with how my skin looks after using it. It‚Äôs okay. Has a cooling effect when you apply to the skin. It is gel form so it will soak up in the skin faster. It was not as expected. It is very watery and does not moisturize. I bought this to replace my body shop vitamin E daily moisturizer and it has been working really well, if not better on my skin. I have combination (and sensitive) skin. I use this as my day time moisturizer and it has worked really well to hydrate my skin without leaving me oily (despite this summer heat)!  For the price, I can't believe that this works so well. Loved the water gel texture. Perfect for summer. The product packaging isnt sealed and it was a bit damaged so I was a little worried that it had been opened. The container and the inside of it looked fine so it didn't bother me too much.As for the product itself I have nothing but good things to say. I love the lightness of it and it feels refreshing. Smell isn't overwhelming. You don't need much to apply on your face. Love the way my face looks and feels It wasn't as good as I expected for dry skin maybe because it's a gel. It gets absorbed completely and leave me dry after a short time I love its packaging. Very professional and it does seem like it will do the job. Havent used as yet because i am trying to finish out another cream. This Neutrogena moisturizer has the consistency  of Vaseline and has an awful old lady scent. I have tried to use it  since I paid for  it, but I can't it is going in the trash. At first this felt a little sticky on my skin, then after 3 days, my skin seemed extremely dry!It doesn‚Äôt work for me. Not for every day use in my opinion. After using this product for a week I got these very strange dry spots dotted all around my face but especially under my eyes(I didnt use on my eye area) that almost cracked. I didnt change anything else in my routine so this was very strange. It could be that I have very sensitive skin or it didnt react well with other products that I use but it still was a shame that it didn't work out the way I would've liked. This moisturizer is just wonderful. I purchased it after reading many reviews and it did not disappoint.Neutrogena has been a go-to for me for many products in the past and they really came through with a winner here.It is light feeling and not greasy, which I love, especially for the summer months. It just absorbs right into your skin, but the moisturize doesn‚Äôt disappear‚Äîit really impressed me how moisturized my skin feels with just a small amount of product.The scent is nice but not overpowering. It smells fresh.Some products tend to irritate my skin or cause me to break out, but this does not. I do not tend to get eye irritation, so I cannot speak to that.Overall I just really love this moisturizer. Would definitely buy again and highly recommend. It says in the description that it is fragrance free, but upon opening the jar there is a scent to it. In the ingredients it also says there is a scent. So just a little confused on why it would say no fragrance in the description. been using it for about 2 weeks. i like that‚Äôs it‚Äôs light weight and it only takes a dab of the product to use on your whole face but if you are a person with serious dry patches especially in the winter time this may not be for you. i have to use a face oil before putting this on. Made  my skin bumpy and burned a little when I applied. Not a good fit for me.Skin type- acne prone, sensitive, combi"
61,New Balance Men's 623 V3 Casual Comfort Cross Trainer,Computers,"Bought as secondary pair! Great shoe and fits perfectly! Nothing My son has only worn these for about 4 months now. His foot is a size 14, so it's hard to find shoes that actually fit well so we bought 2 pair.  He has had NB running shoes in the past and have been fine. But both of these shoes have already come apart, with the soles coming unglued from each pair. I guess glue isn't what it used to be. Matter of fact, most shoes are terrible anymore, but I guess that what we get for exchanging quality for a smaller price tag.  Too late to return them, but buyer beware. Good product The soles feel hard and cheap. They became unglued between the soles and the leather in two places after only a few weeks. Too bad. I‚Äôm going back to Nike‚Äôs. this is what the doctor called for A OKAY Very disappointed with the shoes, in less than two month under normal wear the leather  is starting to crack. I get New Balance because I like them plus the insole comes out so I can use my arch support insoles instead. Is a little longer than expected.  Whole shoe is roomier which is not a good thing for my heels/ankles.  Very clunky and I feel off balance,  but irs not their fault I have wide feet and have to buy men's shoes After about two months of walking 3 miles 4-5 times per week.... the shoes have a weird occasional squishy feel to them.I've been a long time user of the 623 model and have never had this problem before. I'd send them back if I could. Love the shoe fit, but the sole is some sort of plastic instead of rubber.  Slippery and noisy. Maybe it is just my feet but the comfort for me is just not there.  I usually get the 411 style and have been happy with them.  However I am hard on shoe uppers and I though the all leather tops on these would be more durable. Well I am sure these will last me a long time because I will never wear them for more than a hour or two at a time. The stitching at the toe is very weak.  I  purchase 2 pairs and the toe stitching failed on both pairs within 2 months. Try another brand. Needed these for our son who wears braces. For perfect! New Balance used to supply insoles which had at least some reasonable arch support and heel padding.  This insole is a flat piece of foam rubber about 1/8th of an inch thick; it is essentially worthless  Add the separate cost of a good insole to what you are willing to spend. I purchased the white shoes, they fit great.  Later I purchased a pair of black ones.  The black shoes where smaller than the white ones.  Shorter and narrower. This is the second pair of this shoe that one of the eyelets broke. The first pair was within the return window, which means they didn't last more than a month. Unfortunately this pair lasted almost three months. That means I can't return them. Come on New Balance, try creating a shoe where the eyelets last at least as long as the sole. I've always loved New Balance shoes, and while I don't want to be too hard on this shoe, I feel compelled to say that it doesn't seem like they make these shoes with the same quality that they used to.  I have had numerous pairs of New Balance over the years, and they used to take a beating and keep on going, but not anymore.  I have had this particular pair of shoe now for about one (1) year; used them for walking on concrete mostly.  To the shoe's credit, it is comfortable and is solid (for awhile), but the lack of enduring quality is its flaw.A few months ago, I noticed that they were coming apart on the side where my small toe meets the shoe on both shoes.  Now, I have a narrow foot, and there was some shift (not much since I wore 2 pairs of socks with them), and perhaps that contributed to this.  I've walked well over 100 miles in these shoes and, again, they are not bad shoes...they are pretty solid, but they should simply last longer and not come apart like this.  I literally have a hole in each shoe on the sides as I mentioned, and that's just a lack of quality right there.Recently, I purchased a pair of Skechers, so I'm going to see how they work...they are extremely comfortable and fit better than these.  Like I said, I've always loved New Balance, and I'm not saying I'm done with them yet because I love the style of this shoe, but coming apart in less than a year is unacceptable to me and shows a lack of quality.  I'll probably give New Balance another chance, but it will be the last chance if the result is the same as this pair. Husband had for 2 weeks.  Feet hurt bad . No arch support. I reordered same as last time but style numbers were different. They were way narrow. Not happy at all. I ordered big as I had an issue with a bad nail so I needed the room so I can‚Äôt speak to size and fit but they are comfy but after a long day minor aches for bigger guys possible. Otherwise I found them comfortable Product was perfect.  Using for casual dress. Not agooddeal for these, would return them if I could I bought this to serve as part of my marching band uniform. I had assumed that new balance produce shoes with good arch supports. Not the case with this pair of shoes. Absolutely no arch support at all! Shoe is not very comfortable These shoes are relatively lightweight and comfortable.  So far, so good....excellent walking shoe.  Not much arch support though....nearly none. Not as nice as the 608 model shoe. Also it is not as wide as the 608 model. I usually like New Balance shoes, but this one just feels cheap and unsupportive. too long in the toe and dont breath well They are not bad, but they are not great. I was expecting them to be more comfortable. comfortable and well made The shoes are too wide I like these shoes because it has good support overall good look, sturdy arch support and overall a  Its not quite an actual 4E, but with some use it breaks in.  The insert can be removed so that gave me more room.  For the price you can not beat this product.  There could be some minor adjustments in this product, that the toe box a bit snug and pointy and not square.  A better gluing job is needed as well.  Overall out of the box I would give this product 4 stars, but slightly narrower than  a 14 4E fit I gave it 3 stars. Its not quite an actual 4E, but with some use it breaks in.  The insert can be removed so that gave me more room.  I have buy New balance for years and the trend i noticed is the gluing breaks down after 4-6 months, hopefully that can be fixed.  Conclusion, you get what you pay for, its a nice product, but some improvements could be made. Good shoe! I am breaking out the toe area on the right side which turned out to be a tad too tight!!!! I love New Balance shoes. This shoe; however, has no arch support. Spend some money for some inserts. My last pair lasted 4 years with hard useage in indoor and outdoor courts. The new pair fit perfectly. Love these shoes for the purpose intended. I ordered another brand at the same time for the same purpose and they are OK. I will use them also but these New Balance shoes are more comfortable and fit better. I have been buying this model for years, this one has somehow cheaper material look, cushioning less felt. Let's see if performs well over time as its predecessors One shoe had a pointed toe, the other has the expected rounded toe. It was too much trouble to return them. Lesson learned. Clearly this pair was not quality checked. All my sneakers are size 10.  These sneakers in size 10 squeeze my toes.  A blister formed on my left foot after the second wearing.  I do not like them These have been my go-to walking/training shoes for years. I have subtracted one star because I have had a couple pairs fail with a separation of the toe area leather from the upper. I ordered a ‚Äúwide‚Äù which is generally a 2E.I received shoes that are siniicantlwier than any 4E (‚Äúextra wide‚Äù) I ever tried.There is no width estimation the label. Poor quality.  The sole is separating after only 1 month of casual wear.Disappointed.  NB is my go to sneaker but this pair is not what I want New Balance is my favorite tennis shoe and I purchased this brand and they fit just fine and then I went ahead and purchased a second pair once I found these worked out. Very good shoe. I ordered a wide and got a 2E instead of an E. It's OK, but wider than most that are sold as wide. Lacing it tight is good enough to avoid returning it. I bought these nearly 2 years ago, and I wore these more than 50% of the time over the 2-year period. Over the past 9 months, I wore these daily probably 90% of the time. As time went on, my feet and back just seemed to get worse. I just assumed my feet were getting worse and were certainly not improving.Because these are 2 years old, I retired them and bought a pair of NB 669 V2 walking shoe for everyday use. Boy what a difference those shoes make! I wore the 623 V3 when doing yard work for a day, and man did I suffer. That's when I realized it was the shoes giving me grief! I think it is a combination of everything, the soles, inserts, and fit. I've been a NB loyalist for 20 years. But the lesson I learned is: stick with walking shoes and stay away from cross trainers. Since had these shoes since May, and they are already separating.  Seems like very poor quality or poor quality inspection.  The sole is separating from the upper shoe.  Need to add that the right  shoes sole has now separated.  Totally disappointing in this New Balance 623. I have only had this pair for 3 months before the seem at the toe started to come apart disappointed in New Balance quality for the first time Uncomfortablelow quality Thank you I have worn these shoes for several years and they are good, comfortable shoes. I only buy New Balance because they fit great and are comfortable. THESE SHOES ARE A FAKE KNOCK OFF !!!!NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. Owned less than a month, have worn a dozen times, sole separated on the right shoe already. New Balance has gone down hill last few years. Will not buy again.Updating my reviewThese are by far the worst shoes I have ever purchased. No support, and every two weeks the sole starts to separate from the shoe and I have to reglue.Left shoe hasn‚Äôt fallen apart... yet I have been purchasing the N Balance sneakers for years to work. The last pair i purchased i had to return as the top part of the sneaker was pleather, i have a narrow foot and the sneaker was too tight, too small and returned and had to order directly from  new New Balance . disappointing as i always depended on Amazon for excellent fit sneakers. however my other 3-4 pairs purchased in years excellent Shoes not true to size. Good shoe I bought these May 2018 and by Sept 2018 the stitching on the toe on the right shoe came loose and got worse quickly. I only walk in these shoes or wear them casually. No running or sports. They did last 4 1/2 months but I did not expect the shoes to fall apart at the seams in that little time. Especially just walking. There isn't much wear on the sole. I don't know how they would have held up if I played sports in them. I‚Äôve worn this style shoe for several years.  I like the width more than anything.  These shoes last a long time, but I only use them for walking. Hastily made The tongue of the shoe is ill fitted. I use them for work, So they will do for now. I  Won't purchase them again. fits according to expectations. I have been using new balance shoes for more than ten years. This is the first time I have had a problem.After only 6 weeks of light use, starting at the heel the sole is separating from the shoe.Will no longer buy New Balance shoes or  use this vendor. i Dont know  who made this product OR where it came from, BUT,  on or about the end of August, 2020 These shoes started coming Apart on the sides and the bottoms.  Sad to say BUT, I've actually had to use Gorilla glue to keep them together, ONLY after TWO MONTHS.  I ONLY wear them for Work which consists of Walking indoors for 3-4 hrs  and then Driving a Vehicle another 3 hrs.. I do not wear them for personal use because works requires a leather upper.  I dont know who is SELLING THIS PRODUCT BUT, I would not recommend anyone buying this shoe, online from this seller,,  I have NEVER had a shoe fall apart after 2 months of light wear.. Perfect without going to store I received the sneakers and they were two different sizes I have bought this particular model shoe for years so when I saw the brown color at a good price I decided to make the purchase. The appearance of the shoe is different from the white/blue model but the picture on Amazon is accurate. Also, there was not a problem with the workmanship. However, this brown shoe was not comfortable and fit snugly. Couldn't quite put my finger on it until I compared it to another new shoe. The front of the shoe is bent upward like an elf shoe. That is why it was so uncomfortable. The shoe upper also is much stiffer than the white/blue model. Not sure if I got defective shoes or if they all are like this. Would be interested in hearing from the seller. Ordered extra wide and found it was very narrow. Materials seem poor. Would not purchase again. Just the way I needed Should of went another size up in width. Didnt fit as well as the last pair same sizeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This product is defective. The left shoe causes the foot to roll out to the side. I have been wearing the white version of this shoe for years.  It gets a bad rap and the ""old guy shoe"".  That is because of the comfortable width.  Not I can wear these black shoes and avoid the stereo type. Fit not as good as previous NB I have purchased Not as comfortable as I thought I‚Äôve bought this model in the past however the ‚Äòbubble ‚Äò in the heel that makes the ABZORB system collapsed. Walking with a thump now. Usually I get two of service however these are only five months old. Wonder if I have any recourse? This is my second time purchasing these shoes for my brother. The first pair didn't last long because I thought my brother was a little rough with them. After wearing them one time in the rain/snow they looked terrible. This time the shoes looked bad right out of the box. They had this white cast on them as if they were already worn in the snow. My brother works in the shoe department in a store and he says this happens when shoes are stored in a box for a long period of time. He wanted to keep the even though I wanted to send them back. I wish the seller would make it known that there are imperfections in their products, which would explain the discount. The shoes start off tight and need to be broken in. Order at your own risk. I've used this shoe for a couple decades.......this one simply doesn't fit.  I foolishly did not try it, and kept it in reserve, and when I put them on, five months later, like to choke toes to death.  Shame on NB!  Poor quality control.  They clearly say eleven, but they are more like ten and a half, and totally unusable. Has no support. I used to sell new balance and they must be owned by different company because they used to be good supportive and everything else and now they  Suck make my feet hurt Don't buy them soles wear out on these shoes in two months on hard courts Better fit than what I find in stores So uncomfortable stitching on toe has seperated after 44 days of ownership. Shoe fits great on my wide foot. Finally my feet don't hurt and I wore them all day and evening walking around a fair. They had a 14EW. Hard to find.  Very Satisfied. arch support and fit are not quite as good as my old 608V3  , but they are better than just about any other shoe for the money. Still like the brown suede... Sole fell off within 15 days. I like the new Balance brand but the last 2 pair from Amazon have been substandard. Size 9 was more like a10 , very little support Great product, but with some use, the very bottom part of the heel tends to come loose. The shoes fit as expected but are just very uncomfortable. Very comfortable and affordable. perfect fit I tried these on at a local Dicks store, then found them 20 buck cheaper on Amazon. They fit just like the ones in the store.  3 stars because after a month of wearing these I've realized they don't have enough support or cushioning or something for my feet. I wear them to work (why I bought them) but only for work and change into my old running shoes after. I work in retail so im constantly moving around and in less then 2 months the shoe is already starting to break The overall design adn length were fine on lthis show. How Sneakers too tight in the toe box - will be returning. These are a great fitting shoe with a nice style and color. This shoe fits great.  Had an awful squeak when walking since the first step.  I wear them every now and then to work in an office setting.  In around two months of that sort of use, the sole came off.  It is still glued at the toe, but other than that inch of glue, the complete rest of the sole has separated and just hangs by the toe.  Shoe is totally unwearable now. I have odd shaped toes, and bought these because of the larger toe box.  Unfortunately, though they felt all right when I first wore them, the stiff leather cut across my foot when walking.  I won't return;  they'll work for occasional use, but not for walking.  I have some shoe stretchers which I'll use to make these usable. Too tight! shoes were just too small My husband works in law enforcement with a soft shoe profile. He has to wear black shoes so I purchased these. The quality is not great as the sole comes apart from the shoe after wearing them for a few weeks. He decided to go back to boots since the quality of tennis shoes don‚Äôt hold up to his work load. kinda small for a 13 no girth kinda flimsy with laces almost too short to tie The fit is perfect and it's very comfortable. The back heal is not supportive ... New Balance normally makes a better product but not this time. Shoe was too marrow The one place this pair seems to lack compared to past purchases of the same shoe is in the comfort of the inner liner.  I can sense the roughness on the bottom of my foot.  The sole liner could be better.  I guess I need to wear a thicker sock or it needs to be broken in more (several more weeks or months of wear needed?) 1 problem the soles come apart after a long time but long before the rest of the shoe is bad or old looking. They last less than a year for me. Granted I use them at work and do a lot of walking in them. I should‚Äôve ordered the next larger size I have been ording this shoe for 6 years in an xtra extra wide.. I ordered 3 pair and every one of them have been too narrow üò° Tried shoe stretch, wooden stretchers, etc with NO luck to get them comfortable. Unfortunately by the time we realized it, it was too late to return them..VERY DISAPPOINTED I am retired.  I wear size 16 wide athletic shoes.  It is hard to find my size.  I have worn New Balance shoes for over 20 years.  I am very satisfied with the shoe. 10 wide is best fit for size 10. I use as a walking shoe Needed to replace previous shoes.  New Balance seem to run  closer to narrow than other brands I have worn. Shoes are comfortable and provide good support. Probably my 5th or 6th new pair. The seam has come apart with just a few wears. not the comfort I have come to expect from new balance. The shoes said it was a10.5 that I ordered.. If fit like a 9.0 shoe and did not fit.. Amazon has an amazing way to return products.. GREAT !!! These 3 pairs were ordered and received in October of 2017.  I put one pair into service Spring of 2018 and needed to start using pair No. 2 this past weekend (November 2019).  I know from past experiences (and I sold shoes from 1963 to 1968) that shoes need a certain time of break-in, so I didn't think it unusual that pair No. 2 was tight on my feet the first day.  They became excruciatingly tight during the first day of wear and all day of the second day of wear.  So painful I quit wearing them at all and reverted back to a pair I had had prior to 2017 (The 2018 pair No. 1 was muddy and drying out prior to cleaning the soles so they could be worn indoors on carpet).  Today I cleaned the soles of pair No. 1.  Then I decided to compare pair No. 1 to pair No. 2, 2 being the newest pair worn two days this week. My feet were still sore today from the ""test run"" and I don't run in them. Results:  Pair No. 2 is visibly at least one full size smaller than pair No. 1 and pair No.3.  The soles on pair No. 2 are different from 1 and 3.  Labeling on the box No. 2 came in is different than 1 and 3 - it looks to have been cut off of another (Size 9) box and taped over the new box of 11-1/2 D's.  It has been two years since purchasing these shoes and I do not expect a refund or an exchange - but it would be nice. Except for the strange box label all other labeling for the ""too small"" pair appears to be for a size 11-1/2 D pair.  BUYER BEWARE! The pair I got seemed to be factory seconds, but stores were closed due to Covid 19. So had to use Soles started to separate from the shoe 5 months in, feel like I've been shafted with a factory reject not good on slick wet surfaces The sneakers were fine, good fit etc.. until after a month one of the shoelace holes split open and became unusable. At that time I decided to put up with it to avoid the hassle of returning them. Now about four months after the purchase another hole split , the shoe cannot be laced properly at all. T I expected much more from Amazon and New Balance. Nice and comfy As a whole, the shoes are okay but the toe area on the left shoe is extremely tight.  I've worn size 8 all my life but if one shoe is tighter than the other -- and downright uncomfortable, if I have to be honest -- I should have returned these right away.  However, as I purchased them for gym use and a back injury prevented me from working out for several weeks, I'm only now really finding out about the mis-matched construction.  Many people love New Balance but the slipshod workmanship of this, my first pair, will undoubtedly compel me to AVOID THIS BRAND in the future. parts of the shoe come unglued after just 4 hours a day of wear in only 1 month time.spend the extra money and get a better shoe to avoid the aggravation and having to buy another pair of shoes so fast.In short these shoes suck something fierce,happy shopping. 8/11/2020 returned process completed, modify overall rating to three stars :-)Any return status update 8/1/20?I ordered x-wide but still too tight :( I switched over to the new balance fresh foam more V1 for a more comfortable fit. Just what I wanted I like the way the product looked Returned them. Feels cheap, not like the New Balance I have bought over the past ten years or so. they feel pretty good, only thing is while breaking them in they squeak on tile floors. Why can't New Balance just be consistent? Bought these shoes to replace a pair of mx409v3 that I had for a year and these new shoes make my feet hurt all the time. And yes, I know, I know,.. the break in period, your feet have to adjust and all. Well I also bought a pair of 460v2 at the same time and I have no issue with them making my feet hurt. There is something with these shoes that just doesn't work for me. And of course I'm past the return date since I thought that they would ""break in"", they didn't. Replacement pair  for same (brand/ model).  Both length and width smaller!Hope they stretch with time.Price and delivery good! These shoes (size 15M) were a bit tight when I got them, and remained that way, but I thought they would be passable. I wore them daily for about a month-and-a-half but, about a week after my return window closed, my right arch started hurting quite a bit. So much so, in fact, I started limping and even had to limit my walking distance when I wore these shoes. When I switched back to my old pair of New Balance, most of the pain subsided. I haven't worn them for 5-7 days and I'm now about 90% pain-free. $ wasted I was hesitant to purchase shoes online as I have never done it before. I love New Balance shoes (made in America) and they fit great. I'd definitely buy these again. Large shoes seem to be hard to find, but the Amazon made it easy. Shoes are exactly what I expected., Size 16-wide. Received in brand new condition in just a few days. They were bought for someone else Two months and the soles are already coming off at the toe on the right shoe.  Disappointed.  New Balance used yo make good quality shoes. The shoe wore out fast. I looked back to see when I had ordered it. Disappointing to see it had only been 6 months. Bought these as work shoes for my son who wears a 15 and has flat feet. They are very comfortable and make standing for long periods easier. Very nice business. On Time‚Ä¶.."
62,"Nike Unisex Adult OneSize Swoosh H86, Black/Metallic Silver, One Size",Computers,"very happy Clasp doesn't grip to tighten cap. Great fit, but the Nike logo is starting to creep, and the gum used is showing up on the logo. I have ordered this hat twice before from Amazon, because I liked the fit and quality. I have just opened my new order and the quality is very poor, the material is paper thin. Very satisfied Average quality My fault perhaps I did not read the reviews. This hat is cheep polyester NO COTTON as in description, How Amazon allows this to continue I dont know.... oh yes money. The hat is also extremely small and im sure my head is not that big. Waste of time and money and a rip off, just my oppinion. It fits well and feels great.  The materials are soft and comfortable. Good quality for a reasonable price. Disappointed overall as all man-made and too warm for the Summer. Not even waterproof. Just paying for the name. Far better products are available (and from Amazon). great üëå Great for everything. You can just grab it and go. This hat was made of strange silky material, not dry cotton as expected. Every other cap I‚Äôve purchased has been cotton so this felt slippery and cheap. Sent it back. A very light and breathable material. The strap helps adjust your desired size. A discreet Nike metal logo on the side makes the cap very stylish. Great for the gym or running! Makes a great accessory to jeans/sweatshirts and adds more flare. My Husband really liked it, thank you! Just what we wanted Good fit for women, would buy again. Nice quality. The product not really with my expectation, the material so soft and not like addidas. I love it. It's says unisex but it's made for women. This is a comfortable classic style that looks good on a lot of different people. It‚Äôs lightweight and durable. Bought a couple for myself and as gifts. I wasn‚Äôt so happy with it.Seem a bit flimsy..Not as study or well made. 100% shiny polyester. Not cotton. It‚Äôs one of those caps that sticks your ears out! Caps do this when they are too long on the sides.I have five other caps by different brands and none do this. Back it went. Thanks Amazon for quick service. Good hat for price. Love it,will definitely order again Product seemed fine on arrival but after a couple of washes the front began to fray and Nike tick fell off in the wash. Very disappointed. This is a soft back hat so be aware if lookin for a hard back cap that keeps its shape once off your head I wear it with my everyday outfit and working out. I love the design and the fact it‚Äôs waterproof. Handy for rainy days, shielded me from the heatwave we had in the UK. Love it Bought as it's the same description as an older cap I have.  Material is different - flimsy.  The fit is odd too and seems to come down too far and swamp my head.  It's fine as a running cap, I'd say.  Disappointed it's not like my other one. Excellent This is a fake Nike Product. They strap literally snapped off the first time I tried to adjust it. I checked the tags and immediately saw that it was fake. DO NOT BUY!!! misleading infomation of the material,it's 100% polyester feels cheap aswell I have worn Nike swoosh caps for years.  I like the way they look and fit.  Now, for no reason, they have made the cap larger and it doesn't fit without rubbing on my ears.  I am a 6' 3'' man with a normal sized head, so it's got to be like this for most people. I ordered this cap because my husband has one already. However, this cap does not fit like the older caps - snug on the head - and the material is cheap.Disappointed with Nike since they should keep to the quality they were known for. Delivered in good time and as described although this is a present so cannot comment on fit Thin material I wear it on my head when coaching I bought this Nike hat in black as I already have it in white from a sports shop years ago. As others have reviewed, the material is thinner than the old hats, which I don‚Äôt mind at all, it‚Äôs cooler for summer. Genuine Nike brand.I love the metal Nike swoosh and the adjustable back. It‚Äôs very comfortable to wear.My problem with it is that this hat is bigger/deeper than my old one. The band sits low down right on my ears and makes my ears stick out. If i try and not pull the hat down snug on my head then it‚Äôs too saggy on the top and looks silly either way. I am a female in my 30‚Äôs, however it fits great on hubby, so I‚Äôve still given 5 stars, as the hat is great quality. Just a shame it‚Äôs not the exact same size of my last one that fits perfectly.

63,Nintendo Joy-Con (L)/(R) Fortnite Fleet Force Bundle - Nintendo Switch,Electronics,"dont do it these are cheap because some less than reputable character bought the defective controllers and is box and selling them back to the public. DO NOT BUY!!!!  these are cheap because amazon allows people to sell as long as they fit an online profile. so please help yourself and dont do it . Came with missing pieces son loved it Bought the controllers brand new and the pink one is defective. The side buttons don't work to connect the controller. Disappointing the instructions are in Japanese Green stopped charging in less than a month. Only works when plugged in, but I got this to play 4 player games on the tv i got these joycons after mine got a really bad drift and i couldn't move. after about a week they got the same drift i could only go up. i just sent them back and got new ones. guess what... they got a really bad drift too after a few days. Nintendos cheap. I am now having to purchase another controller...Nothing happened to damage it, the left one just stopped working. Good product, hard to keep clean. Seems like every new Nintendo next generation console is getting worst in quality specially the controller, small buttons, uncomfortable, poor quality and over priced. These are your standard Joy-Con.  I would be thrilled about them if only they'd fix the small release button piece being made out of fragile plastic.  After about 3 months my left Joy-Con once again slides off without releasing the button as this little nub has worn away. Loved the colors.  However, on the pink joycon, something is wrong with the joystick.  When you use the controller, it acts like your holding the joycon down and just keeps spinning through menus.  Amazon kindly refunded us for the broken controller... although now I'm short half a pair.  (We did have the option to return them both for a full refund) I feel it's good but not that good?I think.. The joy sticks look very bumpy and the left joy con just started to drift after only a few minutes Perfect for kids. It‚Äôs kinda small for adults. When I purchased the one I did it did not say in the description that it was used. I expected new and would have paid more from a different source of necessary. I have a pending claim with the company and will update review when they respond I bought these January 1, 2018. It‚Äôs now May 2020 and they‚Äôve been drifting for a month. They were $79 when I first bought them and over 2 year later they‚Äôre now $97.99. I wish the quality was better, they should last longer than 2 years. Two out of 4 controllers broke within two months without being treated roughly.  So far, I haven't heard back from Nintendo.  Amazon only gave us a $5 gift card.  I would expect much higher quality when these controllers are $40 each! purple&orange are two of my favourite colours, so i was excited to receive. until wireless remotes and games stopped working properly the moment they were attached to the console. i had cars and people going backward and i wasnt touching anything. i had games that wanted you to press L&R. and it wont leave thats connect the controller screen.the moment i put in the joy cons i had before.  everything connected & worked fine. These are barely used and broke less than 3 months in beyond disappointed that I now have to purchase elsewhere Was happy to get different color remote for our switch. HOWEVER 7 months later and the green remote disconnects all the time which interrupts the game play. It‚Äôs very frustrating and this shouldn‚Äôt be happening.  How can I get a replacement? Great Seller! They look and work great attached to the switch console but if used wirelessly the right controller loses connection constantly.I bought these to replace my original joycons that came with my 2017 console, assuming they had since fixed the connectivity issues, but I guess they have not so I'll be returning them. Only got 1 of the two joysticks and the box was open when it arrived. I bought these since one of the joy cons that came with my orig. unit didn't function properly. but basically, these are the worst controllers Nintendo has created.. Way too small for an adult hand, cheesy buttons, too easily prone to fail. (see all the discussions about drif).Sadly, they are required by lots of software, and need to be seated in the main unit to utilize your TV.I really appreciate the genius it took for Nintendo to create a multifunction (hand held or on-screen) console. But like many things that try to do too many things  -- it doesn't succeed as well doing either - (folks who only want handheld will likely disagree).Thankfully Nintendo Pro Controller (STICK WITH THE BRAND) is excellent Great feel, colors really pop! I received the European version which is Green Left and Pink Right.. the opposite of the one in the description and picture.. They work but two weeks after I got them my sister in laws dog chewed my left joystick on the joy con.. The left joycon is uneven and the right joy con Y button does not work, do not trust your money here, order from somewhere else or find in person I was once doubting about their authenticity because they have a slightly rougher surface than my Japanese original ones (it might be a regional difference tho), but now I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre real, because they started drifting after a month just like my old original ones. Typical Nintendo‚Äôs quality control of product hehe. I barely used them for action games since I‚Äôve got my pro controller, really didn‚Äôt expect the drifting in such a short time without even touching them much. Excelente The orange controller was missing the release button as well as it didn't even turn on. Worked well and i love the colors Generally great, but the right joycon seems to have bouts of connectivity issues from time to time. They work just how they're supposed to. It's really fun to mix up the colors sometimes. They shipped quickly, attached and charged up and work great.  Great replacement for my original ones that have since broken due to over use.  ;) The left controller does not stay locked in place!! I had just got these last week! Also I‚Äôve noticed it bugging out with making it go one way by itself. For the price this shouldn‚Äôt be happening! I don‚Äôt have the box it came it sadly because I did not think this would happen since the seller is actually Nintendo. Disappointed Sometimes, I click it onto the switch and it just doesn't register. Like the pins don't connect? Might be my fault though... The discription said it comes with a grip but it didn't. EDIT: Nintendo is offering free mail in repair service apparently and this is a known issue.. I filed a claim ticket with them last night and received a shipping label today, even with the pandemic in full swing. At least they‚Äôre doing their best without a full recall. Will update again after service.ORIG: After just 4 months, the left joycon will not stay connected to the switch in handheld mode, just like the blue one my device came with (which I only purchased In January). Nintendo needs to do a serious re-engineering of these controllers to stop the lock mechanism failure and offer replacement under warranty. I bought this product think they where new or else I wouldnt have paid full price. One of the joy cons already had the drifting problem when it arrived. The other joy con began to drift a month later and we barely used it. Rather disappointing. I bought these as an anniversary present for my fiance. That work perfectly. The only reason I'm knocking a star off is because the green controller had some cosmetic damage when it arrived. It doesn't affect the function of the joycons, but when I'm paying over $50 for something, I have expectations about the way it should look. At the bottom of the joycon there is some scratches in the paint that were there when it arrived. bought these two to play with friends.  Good quality and cool color. My grandson enjoys the switch and joy sticks Had less than a year and they‚Äôve almost stopped working completely. Not cheap so I‚Äôm seriously disappointed. The Joy-Cons are a lot of fun with several people. They can be a little hard to hold individually, so we‚Äôve bought grips for all of them, making it much easier to play. It appeared this set of controller is much better than previously purchased ones that had a joy-con drift issue a couple years ago. So far no drift issue is found. I speculate the Nintendo has improved it secretly over the years. Anyway I'm happy with the new controllers. Received broken item. The left controller no matter how much it was calibrated just kept drifting on every game. Not the best impression. Broke a few months after use. Purchased this set two time. the first time the right joy con was broken and never worked. The second time the right joy con was missing a grip. I bought the replacement piece just to avoid having to do another return but I would not recommend anyone buy this from here. The price is the same on Nintendo website and most major retailors. Ive seen them for less money as well. As ordered.  All good. Kind of fragile The product arrived within a few days which was great, but the joycons thumbsticks didn't work properly and are unplayable These are very nice looking controllers but they only came with 200 v-bucks! I ordered these from here because it said 500 v-bucks & the store only offered 200 so it is false advertising but we love the controllers. They look great & function very well! Because of the false advertising I take away 2 stars! The actual controllers are awesome looking & really look better than than the original ones it came with in my opinion therefore I would give 5 stars for the controllers but since they falsely advertise I had to give only 3 stars! Pretty good! Wow what a let down. The box looks red, but the controller is faaarrr from it. Neon Pink would be the correct name, not red. Although we do enjoy the new features that Switch have over Wii:* Does not require sensor bar* Portable - able to play on-the-go with build-in console batteryThere are few limitations that we were not aware prior to purchase:* Joy Con battery not removable. (Since rechargeable batteries have limited life, customers will need to purchase new controllers every 1-2 years depending on amount of use)* Joy Con controller size are small for adults including the joystick & buttons* Gel-Con Guards need to be removed when switching to Wheel adopter* Hand Strap need to removed in order to place on charger Had to get more joy cons because of stick issues of the other Nintendo units (~1yr old)  These worked well, but I am sure they will pile up just the others.  Nintendo needs to sort these things out. just got it from last week (4/26/17). They still did not fix the left Joy-Con issue. if you physically block you joy con by object, it will get uncontrollable or even disconnected. Gonna return this and wait for new model. Got these to replace the pair that came with my switch that suffered drifting issues. I haven't had any drifting issues with these so far but the left stick definitely has that odd spring squeek noise. Seems you can't ever get a perfect joycon but I can deal with the noise over drifting any day If the Switch doesn't have a clear line of site and isn't close by, they don't work.  Also the typical drift. My grandson said it worked perfectly It was a great controller at first but it broke within a few months. Joycon joystick does not work properly anymore, making the controller pretty much unusable.  Sad, considering how crazy expensive it was. Gotta love the flipped version of the classic red and blue joycon. Fun and stylish even on their own, but especially to make a monochrome Bleu or red themes Switch. The controller now has my person walking even when I‚Äôm not moving it Joysticks constantly lagging and getting stuck within the games. I have had them for over 6 months and still no improvement, even with updates. The analog sticks on both joy cons drift in game. Brand new Exactly what I expected Purchased an extra set of controllers so we could get more people to join in on super smash bro's and mario party. They were easy to setup and are the same ones that came with the nintendo switch. If you have big hands you will have a different time using this controller. I am curious on the longevity of these controllers and hope they will last for years. I only rated these 3 stars as I believe the price is rather expensive for such a small piece of hardware. Got exactly what i ordered and wanted. Start drifting after 40 hours gameplay I bought these for my daughter‚Äôs birthday. She LOVES them!! The colors are beautiful and they are made well. I wish there was a bigger pack option, like 4 or 6! Colors are nice. Not even a full week and they started drifting. I wouldn‚Äôt bother getting any new Joy Cons or a new switch/lite until they fix the drift. I desperately wanted to love this product. I'm a huge Nintendo fan & Switch advocate. I love that they have HD rumble, an NFC reader, & pretty responsive gyro controls. I even love that they can be used as individual controllers for many games. What I don't love is the horrible drift all 6 pairs I've purchased has eventually gotten (4 different pairs purchased, a blue pair, 2 yellow pair, & the green/pink pair, plus 2 more pairs from purchasing systems). Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should've gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once. Nintendo did not charge me anything to send them for repairs because each time they claimed nothing was wrong with them & the very same Joy-Cons would be returned to me. Lo & behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I've heard people say the size of these controllers aren't bothersome or small. I've also heard people say they're much too small, & I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding & playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I don't know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails. This is especially true for my original Cons, they would frequently have to be clicked back into place for handheld mode. Overall I don't mind how the Joy-Cons work at all. But either I'm an incredibly unlucky sob or there is something wrong with how the control sticks are designed or manufactured. I bought these for my switch (kinda obvious) in order to play with multiple people. The controllers were working fine but after a few uses I realized that they would get read improper movements on the joycons joysticks. They move up and down drastically on their own and get stuck like that for a while. It‚Äôs happened on both of the controllers I got here. Although I was content with everything, im not feeling quite content with this quite pricey purchase if they‚Äôre not going to work. Hopefully if I send them to Nintendo they can work it out. Soon. I had this product for about a year now but for as long as I can remember, the left controller has been off. Whenever I am using the left controller, my screen or a character in the game runs left on its own. When I‚Äôm in the menu or options, the cursor runs left as well. Yes !!! No more grumpy teenager complaining about the joycons that came with the original Nintendo Switch package. They broke less than a month after I bought the Switch and he wasn't able to play any of his games. These work great and he has been playing all his games again as well as asking me to buy a few more.  I have always preferred Nintendo products over Xbox or Playstation even though we have those too, so I was really disappointed that the joycons were so cheaply made that they broke so quickly. But these new ones work great üëç I highly recommend this product if you need to replace your joycons üíØüòä I bought this products exactly 3 months, for last 3 weeks the left joystick have been slowly moving to the left, now is like having the left pressed all the time. Too expensive to work only 3 months. So this is an authentic controller for the Nintendo Switch. Issue is the switch controllers are cheap. The joysticks are poorly made and begin to pull one way or another within a few months. This is my third set of replacements in 8 months. Order the replacement parts and repair them yourselves and save 60 bucks. It‚Äôs ok Either I got a lemon or these are some bull crap Chinese knockoff controllers. I had it for a week before the left joystick decided to be screwy.*EDIT*Got an exchange from amazon and it works as expected. First one was a lemon üçã It has worked fine for my kiddo! Perfect for the kiddos First of all I love nintendo but this is an overpriced garbage. Bought my switch on release day first month one of the button died.Never been dropped or anything now for Christmas I bought an other pack of these beautiful coloured joycons. The purple wasn‚Äôt even the right color I got pink instof the purple but thats ok I didn‚Äôt complained. Now after one month the joycons are shifting. Didn‚Äôt even touch it and my character walking to the right all the time. I updated,recalibrated but nothing. So thanks for the overpriced garbage Nintendo. Ohh yes and the online store??? Omg full of indie garbage where u cant even get refund not like Oculus where u can try for 2 hours and if u dont like it they pay your money back. Here?? U bought garbage?? Thats your problem. Soo beee very careful They work perfectly. I just wish the originals didn't break so easily (it's a known problem from what I understand). Plus I wish these weren't quite so expensive. But they do work fine on my son's Nintendo Switch. It‚Äôs joycon and they‚Äôre expensive! We got our neon pair on prime day for $59.99, however shipping was delayed. Nonetheless they work and function fine, but be wary of drifting issues. The reason we needed these were to replace our old pair that had drifting issues. Nintendo is however releasing free repairs for joycons, so if that is your reason to buy new controllers, contact Nintendo before. Got the package on time which was nice, especially during this time. Was disappointed when I finally opened the package to use the controllers and the left one has such bad drift! It‚Äôs brand spanking new and it already doesn‚Äôt work correctly. Not happy Got these for my friends kids why accidentally dropped there switch I love the colors. I just don't love the way the joystick sticks and drifts. I spoke with Nintendo customer support and they talked me through recalibrating and it worked for awhile but it's started doing it again. I had the original joysticks for over a year before they started giving me a problem. I don't think I'll be getting the switch pro if this issue isn't resolved. They work great for several months then they start acting up.. but I love these colors. I just think it's wrong for them to be charging so much money for these since they're pretty junky after just a few months. These worked perfectly for about a week and I loved them, but the right joystick just stopped working in the middle of playing. The rest of the buttons worked fine. This was only after Animal Crossing- it didn't exactly take any hard use/hits. Very disappointed- I bought these because my others I bought a year ago drift so badly. I didn‚Äôt even have the controller for a full day and the left bottom trigger finger broke Daughter loves it. Great product and works perfectly. Like the other reviews, after a few months the controller started veering to the left. Nice change After very careful use joy con controller not functioning over a short period of time!!! My joycons arrived today in a box that wasn‚Äôt a Nintendo box, they have been used they have scuffs and nicks on them and to top it off they didn‚Äôt come with the bumpers as shown in the photos. Totally disappointed and they will be sent back ASAP! Broke within the first month. Nintendo really needs to upgrade the quality of their joycons. This is the second set I‚Äôve had to replace in less than 6 months. Got this at Christmas,  3 months in the player just starts spinning and wont stop until you change the controller The joy cons worked for about a year and then i had to start replacing just about everything to keep them working. Awesome A bit over priced but a cool color, was a nice little ‚Äúswitch up‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.see what I did there? Works as well as any other joycons. The blue is very similar to the color on the package (maybe a little more vibrant) but the yellow is practically neon. The Joycons work really well, but after a while I could hear the spring move in the joystick of the left (purple) Joycon. Besides that, these are pretty good. Exactly what I was looking for; especially when my kids come home on the weekends and want to play the switch, no waiting cuz everyone can play. Good resistance  for the use we did. This look China brand. This is no original. Brought these on a trip with me, and while playing mario kart at a party someone said ""is the kart always supposed to be turning right if i'm not touching anything?"" uh oh.I asked for a replacement and sent them back aaaaand I got my replacement and these ones are working just fine! So easy to pair! Pricey but needed another set! I‚Äôve had these for 2 months and they won‚Äôt stay connected to my switch. son liked th product immensely These are great to use for Mario Kart. It‚Äôs fun when we can all play together! One of the buttons on the right joy con is a bit ""sticky"" I like that the colors are opposite of the ones that came with the switch. It serves it purpose however there are deffecrbon The joysticks and the only way to fix it is to buy new ones. Very disappointed. I expected these to be in a Nintendo box, as the picture shows. However, they are in a padded manila envelope. As these are for a gift. I have not had a chance to see if they are in working order at this time. These were great in the beginning. I bought them at the end of November and 5 months later they don‚Äôt work anymore. It‚Äôs pretty frustrating to keep buying controllers for this system. Especially for $80 bucks each time. They should be lasting a lot longer than a few months!  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Both controls arrived on time and appear to work just fine. However. The texture on both, but especially the green one, is HORRIBLE. I don't think a finishing coat was applied to the green controller as it feels rough to the touch and in general just terrible. It's like my hand can't grip it as well as it can the others. They feel nothing like the original controllers. They're switch controllers.  They work just fine, for a while.  I fully expect the left analog stick to wear and and succumb to drift after about 9 months of use. These are nice and colorful though. Bought a used set. They work flawlessly. No stick drift.Bought a pair of these, as I purchased a used Switch with no Joy Cons. As customary, Nintendo has created a non traditional controller, and to their credit these really do work. This is 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of the odd layout that they went with for the X,Y,A and B buttons. They are the inverse of other console controllers. It was exactly what we were looking for Nintendo has made these controllers to basically work for 2 years or less.  Then you need to go buy another controller set that costs 30% the price of the whole Switch console set.Ridiculous consumerism crapping all over the environment. Bought these to have extras for my kiddos and their friends when playing the switch. They work well and hold a charge for a while. I like that they come in different colors. At first, it wasn't really an issue, I just assumed the joy-con was a little stiffer than I was accustomed to because it was brand new and hadn't been used daily for 2 years like my other two. Still, the right joy-con slid smoother and gave me no troubles. About two weeks after I bought them, the left joy-con started to slide in smoother and I thought that was the end of it. However, they didn't fully connect to the Switch anymore. They'd slid in perfectly, but the Switch didn't register them as attached to the console. So, it couldn't be charged anymore. My older left joy-con works properly so it's not a console issue. The left joy-con has been dead for over a month in my desk and Nintendo won't fix it. Thanks! (It's usually a great product, just don't except any support from Nintendo if anything goes wrong). Product frequently disconnects from console during game play. Certain action buttons will not work at times. Never have any issues with joy-cons supplied with the console. Very unsatisfied with purchase. Received the wrong colors. I ordered a purple/orange joycon and I was sent a red/blue one. So, not what I was expecting - however, the joycon I received works very well, and has a much better grip than the one I have from 2016. The color isn't a dealbreaker for me, so 4 stars for a fully functional joycon that just wasn't the right color :) Ordered once when I bought my new switch, everything seemed to be in working condition, with VERY rare false inputs and disconnections, but overall very functional. I ordered another pair a few weeks later and received a set covered in deep scratches and dents(despite ordering new), and the right control stick drifted downwards(even after recalibration??) and not all of the buttons were working. However, I am currently waiting on the replacements so we will see. I will update this review once the replacements come in.Update: Replacements were mostly fine, but I just keep noticing irritating problems with the rumble, and/or other functions that end up being distracting during gameplay. I don't know whom to blame here, amazon or Nintendo, as my problems don't seem to be reported anywhere else online. I would strongly recommend this purchase if you are looking for a way to play Mariokart or Smash or party-games with your whole family. But, be very cautious with the product as it seems to have a lot of flaws. The refund/return process with them has been very easy, which is almost exclusively the reason these even get the second star. Received this Nintendo controller and it hasn‚Äôt worked since I received it. I bought this for my grandsons who live in the Bahamas therefore they‚Äôre unable to return it. Needless to say I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with it. Left joy-con didn't have a far range, the buttons are way too small, but I guess it worked. They only lasted about 8 months before they started to drift. Bought for spare controllers. Works as they were intended. I bought these remotes so that four people could play Nintendo Switch games at once. They were fine at first, but unfortunately they don't work anymore."
64,"Physicians Formula, Murumuru Butter, Bronzer, 0.38 Oz",Beauty and Personal Care,"I already love physician's formula to begin with. But they're butter bronzers are awesome, smooth, not greasy at all and smell great. I also love the perfume, it smells amazing! Nice texture and scent. I wish they had a little more pigment. Came smashed into pieces Love this bronzer and it smells like coconuts better than any high end brand bronzer I have used Scent pretty strong coconut or something tropical. I saw this on a Jeffree Star video and decided to try it out. The packaging is nice. My favorite thing about it is the smell! Hello tropical vacation! It does have A LOT of fall out. That is probably what I like least about it. The color is well suited to light skin tones. Personally, it would work better for my individual tone if it were a little warmer. Not the best, but not the worst product I have used. I use this as a highlight and a contour! This smells great, goes on smooth and not to dark and not to light. I don‚Äôt use the applicator it comes with, I prefer to use my own makeup brush. Great product! I got the shade deep bronzer and there is nothing deep about it.  It has a very light shimmer to it and that is about it.  I have light tan skin with a yellow undertone. The bronzer has a nice scent but when you apply it there‚Äôs hardly any pigment. I love this bronzer it's the perfect color and smells amazing! The only problem I had it that it was super powdery so there was a lot of kickback. I accidentally dropped it and it made a huge mess in the pan. Fortunately I was able to fix it with a some rubbing alcohol and pressed it back together, now it's much less powdery. I'm still using it and I like it much better now that I pressed it back together, the fallout this isn't an issue. Not dark enough. Plus it smelled funny. Sadly I'm returning . Love the product but it came broken the first time Makeup was broken and when I open it it got all over everything. Had to throw away Love this product! I got the lighter shade for myself and the darker for a friend. We both love the scent and feel like we just got off the beach when wearing it. The clear plastic top was broken; exposing the bronzer, which will no doubt be ruined without something to protect it. Basically there‚Äôs nothing to cover the bronzer. I purchased Sun-Kissed. I would look at this product in person before ordering online.It looks more like a light peach powder on medium skin. And I can see a little shimmer.I could not do any contouring because it is too light. I like this bronzer... smells really nice, has good color(no sparkle). Only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt seem to last very long. But otherwise I like it so far! My favorite bronzer and use it for highlighter and eyeshadow as well! Just OK Nothing special.  Will probably not use it much since I have others that I prefer.  Just bought it to try becuse it was recommended by a blooger I follow.  At least it does not have an orange tinge. I am HIGHLY dissapointed, not in the product itself, but with the fact that I will be unable to even test out this popular bronzer. I received my bronzer shattered in a many pieces and thus I cannot use it. Will not be purchasing any makeup item again. Too hard to work with, feels like you have too much or too little. The scent is nice but gets old quick. Not a winner, prefer M**lani baked I am not sure if I could see the effects of this product. I have a very fair complexion and it didn‚Äôt seem to do much at all. It doesn‚Äôt really show up on my face So soft and moisturizing When I use a brush to apply it gets powerdery, but once I use the sponge and pat it down it‚Äôs not powdery The smell is amazing....like Hawaiian tanning lotion. Hands down.. best bronzer out there!!! This smells like I am on a tropical island in the best way possible. Love to brush over the top of my foundation to give my winter Midwest skin a little kiss of color! Not sure why this color is labeled as  ""deep"".  My complexion is tan (Mac NC45) for reference, and it does not show up on me. Have ordered multiple times and it has been broken every time. This formula is too soft to be shipped well. Perfume was busted and everything is sticky, smells nice wish I could have used it! The rest is perfect. It smells like suntan lotion, which is not bad. The brozer is beautiful! Lots of fall out but still great! My daughter's favorite product. Ordered two- arrived today both completely shattered. Very disappointed teenager here. Great product with wonderful shade to add the look of the sun on your face! It was not nearly dark enough. It does smell great but doesn‚Äôt bronze at all Loved this product so glad I tried it. The color warm the scent is summer like and the product is long lasting. THIS ITEM CAME BROKEN HAD TO RETURN It came pretty broken up from shipping. I don't know if that made the glitter sparkle pieces come more to the top because I look like a disco ball when I put this on. I'm low-key feeling it sometimes but I'd just say it's okay I like this bronzer okay. But it didn't live up to the hype. Not sure if mine was older, but I find it to be a bit patchy with application. I have tried several different brushes just in case that caused the patchiness, but to no avail. The color is also a bit lighter and the scent isn't as glorious as all of the youtubers make it out to be. Then again, maybe that would be because it's not hot off the press in a PR package!Then again, it does work, just with more effort than I'd like. This bronzer is very pretty and natural. I love it so much and whenever I wear it, it gives the prettiest healthy glow. The only thing is that I have a light to medium skin tone and it only shows up when I am very light and not at all when I am tan. I would suggest getting a darker shade if you are even the slightest bit tan. Plus the scent it has is so amazing I just want to smell it 24/7. If you are someone that doesn't like heavily scented products, don't worry you can't smell it when it is on your face. Love this! Wish it was a bit more brown as it pulls a tad orange on me but it‚Äôs wearable. Everyone raves about this bronzer so I wanted to give it a try.  Honestly the smell is a little much for me, and it goes on my pale skin very patchy.  I mean I'll still use it but won't purchase again.  Other less expensive brands like elf, wet and wild and MUR that work better and cost less with no nauseating smell. Broke before I even got it, however was original product and still works great Really like this product  blends beautifully  feels soft  the scent is a bit strong if your not a fan of coconut/ Shea butter type of smell but other than that its a really pretty bronzer Arrived broken! But they sent me a new one for free. Hoping it‚Äôs not broken again! Smells so good though. I have a light/medium skin tone and it‚Äôs a perfect bronze for my skin. I love the smell, very smooth on the skin but turns out lighter than expected. Barely visible. Arrived broken. I received this shattered in the box. Crap, doesn‚Äôt go on well and has no glo If you like a light, soft bronzer then this is perfect. I love the cool undertone to it, I just wish it was a shade or two darker. Im very pale but it still seemed really light. I applied with a bronzer brush. The wear time was roughly 4-6 hours. This covers my uneven skin type great coverageGives the appearance of healthy skinGives to a glow The coconut smell is chemically and strong, the packaging of the product (the compact) is giant because they include a useless foam paddle in the bottom that goes straight in the garbage. Yeah the product isn‚Äôt bad, but the price isn‚Äôt exactly drugstore and the packaging makes using it feel cheap. I‚Äôll use it up but I‚Äôll never rebuy. Good color but all crumbled up from shipping. I love the color it‚Äôs gorgeous! And it smells really delicious! But I‚Äôm devastated! I can‚Äôt use it! I finally got my skin cleared up, got a great routine and higher end makeup that won‚Äôt break me out, even changed my diet and taking probiotics, my face is clear everywhere except where I put this on the perimeter of my forehead jaw bone, and cheek hallows... it happens every time I use it. This really breaks my heart because I love everything about this bronzer. This supposed to be hypo for sensitive skin. It broke out my skin and my face started itching right away after first use. It‚Äôs looks this product contain lots of fragrances and I am allergic! It smells so good to be true that did not have any!! Omg this smells so good! I love the smell and it is a nice calm color. I am super pale and it doesn‚Äôt make me orange. I got it because I am on zoom all day and I was looking paper white. This just gave me enough bronze that I don‚Äôt blend into a white background lol. Product itself is great; however,  it was broken upon arrival lighter than i expected but worked out great for me Quite oarngie unfortunately Smells like butter ....And also works good Love this product, however it was broken when I received it, very disappointed!!! Overall I did not like this product and I returned it. It smelled like a fake sun tan and grossed me out. It also wasn‚Äôt a pretty color in my opinion and was actually too dark, and I‚Äôm medium skin toned. This is a great bronzer, I love how it looks on me and has great coverage. The smell I could do without but it is not overpowering. I am sad to find out that Physicians Formula is no longer cruelty free so I will no longer be purchasing their products, this was my go to brand that I enjoyed and trusted and now I have to find another brand. Creates nice color. The smell is very strong Product is great but smells like something very cheap and it is annoying. Great product but couldn‚Äôt use, the coconut made me break out with acne really bad. Quit using and went away. Beautiful product, but absolutely HORRIBLE shipping/packaging. Compact came absolutely shattered and unusable. Completely dissatisfied. Pretty and light enough for ""not so tan face"" but has absolutely no shimmer. Perhaps change the description? Misleading. It smells like sun tan lotion so that's not ideal. Once I had it on for a bit I couldn't smell it so not a deal breaker. Really like the color and smoothness. Would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for the smell. I was very disappointed how hard it is to put on my makeup brush! gift It came completely broken Love it. I was worried about how this would look on my very pale skin, but it works great! Not too dark, just adds some slight bronze.Looks natural and smells great! Didn't drop it... but it broke after a week. Super jenial Love the smell Alot of utube makeup gurus recommend this bronzer. I'm not a makeup guru, but I like experimenting w makeup. I'm a total drugstore girl, nothing high end here. I don't have alot of bronzers to compare this product to. The ones I had, did their job ok, I suppose. This product has a fantastic smell though. I think it's okay as a bronzer but I'm not blown away by it. Maybe it works for you in an amazing way, but so far, it's been average for me. I gotta come clean, and admit, I'm not a contouring expert. I suppose if your more aware of the contouring applications that work well for your face & the makeup tones needed...this could work for you. Contouring, 101 that's where I should be headed, lol. The product didn't have any shine. I must've gotten the fake product. I'll never order again Received product all broken up.  Can‚Äôt even use it. Love this, especially for my sensitivity with anything. Is perfect. Came completely broken. I had to put it back together with alcohol/water. It arrived broken Smells SO GOOD!!!! New favorite I love the finish, but the scent IS strong, even after applied. My item arrived uncushioned and completely shattered. :( This seems to be a common theme on here. It looked like a lovely color and smelled nice, so I'm sure the product itself is good. it smells like coconut not sure if i love it I've used this from the drugstore before and it was a nice formula and was nicely pigmented on the skin.. this was not the same bronzer and hardly shows up on your face.. it's worth it to just spend an extra few bucks and get it from the store I love this bronzer a little lighter then expected Silky powder, not dusty or flaky.  Goes on smooth. Nice case with a mirror and applicator.  Color could have been a little darker. Returned this. It is supposed to smell like coconut but the scent on this smelled so strong, almost like rancid coconut. I returned it and ordered another one Good product but came shattered and the package was coated in product DISLIKE It‚Äôs orange It came broken up and it was a mess all over my other items in the box This is a really great formula and it blends very nicely. It smells INCREDIBLE and doesn't irritate my sensitive combination skin. The only thing I dislike about this is that when I have dry patches (which I often get on my forehead), it tends to accentuate my dryness. Other than that, it's perfect! This is a perfect Bronzer creamy and has the perfect color and lasts for good time Perfect for fair skin as summer begins! The color is a bit too light for me yet I love the way it smells I have never used this before so I don‚Äôt have a comparison, but it is NOT like butter.  It was very hard, not creamy. It was impossible to spread on my face even with using primer and a makeup sponge. I was also difficult to remove. I had to scrub it off with a washcloth. The compact itself was not shrink wrapped and I can‚Äôt help but think that it was old and dried out. It smells like Frito corn chips !! To be honest when I opened the package this smelled so strongly of coconut fragrance that I didn't even try it on my sensitive skin. There's no way my skin would react well to that. And I discovered that the first ingredient is talc - not what I want to put on my skin.I'm going to keep looking for one with cleaner ingredients and far less irritating fragrance. It's okay, I love the way it smells but I'm not obsessed with it my any means Smells good (coconut) and not too pigmented. I have super sensitive skin and haven't had an issue. Nice product for the price. Scent is strong, not bad but definitely noticeable. Coverage and color is great I really like this product because it‚Äôs a great dupe for higher end makeup products that you‚Äôd find at Sephora or Ulta. This has good color payoff and achieves a bronzed glow without going overboard. It‚Äôs also very buildable which I like. I‚Äôm only giving this product a 4 out of 5 because I found the scent to be a little overwhelming. Upon first application it had a strong sunscreen smell to it that lingers for a while, but it does make you feel like you‚Äôre on vacation to a tropical island, so if that‚Äôs your vibe then get this! The sunscreen scent has died down after a while of owning this product, but like I said this is a great drug store dupe to the higher end beauty brands. Too light for brown skin tones. Bello I'm a tan white girl and the bronzer shade didn't show up on me at all. It was all broken when I received it. I used isopropyl alcohol to put it back together in the pan, but the texture is a little different now. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a decent bronzer for the price. YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ON THE FACE it came broke because the package was not really safe, so I can not give a good advice just can say smell good, so sad The texture on this bronzer is great feels super soft and goes on really great. Drawback is it's a little too orange for me (I just go super light handed on application) and it doesn't wear that long needs touch ups. I bought it because it's popular and good reviews from the beauty bloggers and YouTubers. I have fair to medium skin tone, therefore I choose the original one. I think the color is natural on my face. And maybe it's too natural that I can't really tell if it has the effect. But it may also because my skill or the way I put it on. So I am still using it every day.Some good part about the product:1. The performance is very natural, easy for newbie to use.2. The scent is pleasent for me and the package is sturdy (I didn't know it comes with built in mirror)Some parts can be improved:1. I totally have no idea about the usage of the green sponge come with it.2. It's too natural, it's hard to tell if it's still on my face or not. I bought this after seeing it all over TikTok. It smells great and blends well to my pretty pale skin. I will even someday use the bronzer in my eye makeup in my crease in a quick weekend look. Smells nice, and covers well. Very pleased with this product. Irritating my skin. Like the color and I‚Äôve used this product in the past and it didn‚Äôt before. They must of changed something I brought this product because I saw it had great reviews. Sadly my bronzer was all broken into pieces when I opened it ok for the money Was too light on my olive Mediterranean skin. Also strong smell. I like this product but the packaging came broken and it feels cheep. I didn‚Äôt know Physicians Formula products weren‚Äôt cruelty free, or else I would have never bought it. I also think this color makes me look Orange like an umpa lumpa lol. I‚Äôm light medium color skin. Smells like coconuts! This isn‚Äôt my first choice for bronzer but it works! I absolutely love this bronzer. It smells amazing and has just the right amount of pigmentation to give a subtle contour without being too over-the-top. Typically this is something that I would just pick up at the store but I couldn't pass up the online price. However, when it arrived, it was in 100 little pieces. It may have been a shipping issue but it definitely should packaged a little better. It came in too big of a box with very little packing material. Very pretty, lovely smell, unfortunately like many others it broke within me first day. Great design for compact!  Color and size perfect for me and comes with spongy - easy wash applicator!"
65,"Portable Electric Space Heater with Thermostat, 1500W/750W Safe and Quiet Ceramic Heater Fan, Heat Up 200 Square Feet for Office Room Desk Indoor Use",Home and Kitchen,"Worked pretty well, but completely stopped working within 3 months of getting it. So that was disappointing. I‚Äôve never had a space heater die on me like that :/ Tiny but it works in a one bedroom.Best buy hopefully it will stay and works longer. I got the product today, so haven‚Äôt tested the heat output and etc. lemme just say, I have read the description, and I have read the reviews. I thought it would be quiet, but boy I was wrong. This literally sounds like a loud fan, and it is getting on my nerves. The switch mechanism that is in place to make sure it doesn't tip over and burn your house down, broke in 2 months and now won't turn on without it being held in place a specific angle.It's also the loudest thing in my house. Louder than my AC unit even. Very disappointed in this purchase.The noise should have been a deal breaker, but in the interest of having heat, I kept it. But after 2 months of moderate use, this has gone caput. Buy a different product. It only worked long enough that I could not return it the upright safety switch shorted out it never got moved but somehow the switch broke so I dont suggest buying it Definitely puts out heat Unfortunately this was not my best purchase. Half of the system is producing heat while the other half is producing air (cool air). Im disappointed. It‚Äôs cold in my office. Doesn‚Äôt shut off automatically Good for small area but kinda loud noise of the fan The heater worked pretty well at first. The only thing was that the dial that controls how either how much air comes out or the temperature idrk which because it doesn‚Äôt work. But now after 4 months it just shut off and won‚Äôt turn back on, even if the pin is pushed in. It‚Äôs cheap convenient heater to use for a couple months at best. Invest in something nicer. Also there is a 4inch gap from the bottom of floor to where the heat comes from, therefore you can‚Äôt stand too close it or you won‚Äôt be able to feel it on your feet. Lasted two weeks Disappointing. If it wasn't very cold, it would be a nice heater. This little heater packs a powerful punch.  It keeps my freezing office at just the right temperature. It‚Äôs a great value for the money. Great products. Decent size and works well for my office. Just what I needed. It died within a week. Do not buy No longer needed. This space heater didn‚Äôt work at all for me. It would just get to the point of actually heating an area when it would turn itself off. What a waste of money. That‚Äôs all you need is small, compact kicks out a lot of heat and is an energy saver it works great This was a great little space heater. Used under my desk. Great features - quick shut off if tipped over, solid temperature control (and it can get hot if you need it), 2 heat speeds, or just run the fan.But it suddenly died after only 3 months of use. Purchased October 2020, died Feb 2021... just after the return window closed January 2021.I gave it 2 stars because, despite its pitiful lifespan, it does have good features and it died with grace. I turned it on one morning and after only a minute, it shut off and I smelled a strange faint burnt smell. Then it never worked again. So no overheating or anything dangerous, which is good.Maybe I got a dud, but I'm pretty upset this only lasted a few months. And it's still pretty dang cold where I live so I am not pleased.My previous space heater was by Lasko and purchased on Amazon. It lasted 4 years of use during the winter seasons.I do not recommend this, and I'll probably avoid this brand in the future. It doesn‚Äôt put pit as much heat as I would like The product stopped working after less than 3 months of use and there‚Äôs no option to contact the seller! Terrible! I've used heaters ordered from Amazon for many years.  I've always kept a back up incase the heater failed.  I just realized that last time a heater failed, I didn't order a backup. I use the heater in my bathroom which is always cold.  This heater heats up the bathroom from 64 to 70 in minutes.  My previous heater never seemed warm the bathroom sufficiently.  With my old heater, it had to be pointed directly at me to feel the heat.  With this new heater, I have to point it away from me because of how hot the air is.  With my old heater, there were two speeds.  When I put it on the high setting, it smelled like something was burning and, in fact, that's when the heater failed.  On the new one, there's no need to use the higher setting.  The noise when the heater is on is far from quiet but it's not over powering. I am going to have to return the heater. It is very loud compared to my other space heater. It sound like a fan is blowing on you. It does not seem to produce as much heat as my other one either. Rarely return things but can't keep this. Mostly I am very pleased with this purchase although I displeased that it can't be turned off with just a single effort but requires a second effort to turn off the fan before you can actually ensure the heater is off. Dangerous. Caused my surge protector to burn! We use this in our camper and it works great! The heat output is good. However, the unit is noisier than I expected. Also, the motor seems to ‚Äústruggle‚Äù when I first turn the unit on. It just doesn‚Äôt sound ‚Äúright‚Äù. I've had a few of these same units anx have been happy but this last one was different - the plastic casting was lighter and seemed cheaper.  My last unit got knocked over a few times with minimal damage but this one had the handle break in the 1st few weeks of getting it. 448 square foot studio den apartment excellent choice to warm the place up when it's Sub-Zero out amazed how well this works this is definitely one of my five star purchases on Amazon thank you so much for making a great product Nice and compact - good heat. Just don't like the blowing along with the heat! The heat output is great, too great, really, but there is zero temperature control. Other heaters we‚Äôve had have temp gauges and this one does not have one. It kind of defeats the purpose as it does not shut off once a certain temp is reached. The room starts off ok at night but we wake up sweating every night. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product. Broke within first use. Kept shutting off and would not turn back for sometime. Had to unplug it several times and allow it to sit before it would start again. This definitely works for now, but it is pretty noisy. Also the dials are kind of confusing compared to the old space heater I have. This is a very nice heater. I like the simplicity of the controls. It also seems very safe. If it is on, and it is moved, it will shut down. I feel confident of its safety. It does put out nice heat, but we have only used it in a smallish space (10'x10'). It does have a higher temperature setting, but haven't tried that out yet. I am pleased with this heater for the purposes I intended it for. Bought this heater because the heat in my home office is lacking compared to the rest of the house, so I was sick and tired of trying to use my mouse and type with numb fingers. I started with using the heater on my desk a few feet away from me and it was great but louder than I thought it would be based on reviews I read. Then I decided to try it on the floor placed at the opposite end of the room (about a 15x12 space) and it worked amazingly well. Still louder than I had hoped. I would recommend it with the caveat that it will be loud but not so loud that you can‚Äôt hear or carry on a conversation, just a loser humming sound, and the low end of the temp control compared to the high end is not much a difference.  It still throws about the same amount of heat.  Those two things aside, I would definitely but it again for any room of my home. It heats up my entire bedroom The heater worked fine, but I recognized that the right side didn't heat up at all. I brought this to warm up my feet, but only my left foot would warm up. I was wondering why so, until I put my hand on the right side and I didn't feel any heat coming from that side. I have returned the item and will purchase another heater. Won‚Äôt work After 3 months of barely using it. Crazy! It does the job in heating fast. The light just lights up but it doesn‚Äôt run. Wish I could get a refund or a new one. $30 for barely using it really stinks Mine was fine for a while, it keeps you warm if it's next to you. Only lasted about 30 days before it shut down for good. I bought this heater twice as one broke quickly. The power cord became corroded after only 1 month. I was unable to get any help with it from the company.Getting the heat setting just right is really tricky and almost impossible. It is either too hot or too cold. This tiny little thing blasts heat and I love it! When my big heater gave out, I needed a quick solution. I was surprised how warm this little heater can make any room! Definitely recommend! Makes a lot of noise.  Much louder than the Lazlo heater, but Lazlo quit working after four months. I purchased this in January to use in my office, I would use it 20-40 minutes, maybe 3 days a week. It worked for a few months, then put out a horrible melted plastic smell and hasn't worked since. While I know it's not expensive, I still would expect it to work longer than 3-4 months. warm but noisy The device has a good heat output, controllable and even. Safety features are good to prevent accidental fires. It is small and lightweight. Didn't get to use it when I needed it most....Understandably the heater was late...I bought it as a back up or boost to what I allready had...It was still very cold when power was restored but unfortunately weather delayed the delivery like many other things... Love this little heater for our bathroom! It‚Äôs heats up really well and stays on! The heater stopped working after one month. Amazon didn‚Äôt allow to return it. Heats up a room very fast and has nice fan to cool off Works quite well.  The only reasons for not getting the full 5 stars is that the switch is not in the most convenient possible location; if you are a fat-fingered person the carry handle gets in the way of easily turning the switch, which is fairly small to begin with.  The fan is noisier than I expected also.  But the heat output is excellent and it seems be a nice unit. Our house was remodeled in the winter and the wall with the thermostat was removed. We moved around the country while it was being remodeled and we asked the contractor to finish the master bedroom and bath; which they did.The house sat unheated for 3 months and no thermostat was replaced when we moved back in.  The one night without the heater was a very cold night and the cats decided to sleep under the covers and we wore hats and gloves to bed.It arrived the next day and in a couple of hours it heated a room approximately 500 sq. feet to reasonable and after 4-5 hours we lowered the heat.It looks small but boy did it work. We still occasionally use it in the master bathroom since that room can be cool. I would highly recommend and suggest having at least one for those days that are cool to cold. I love this heater but it stops working, I brought this product this year and we are in April. I‚Äôm very disappointed. I have to unplug. Hard to set temp control Item stopped working twice. Amazon sent me another one a month after I purchased it in March and now it has stopped working again in June. Does anyone make anything that lasts anymore? Only lasted 16 months and it stopped working. Boo. This little heater is perfect under my desk.  It is low wattage, quiet and heats just the area where I'm sitting.  No one even knows it's on. It doesn't really heat my room as much as I would like. In order for the heat to reach the other side of the room, I had to put the heater on an elevated surface. I think this may be better as just an under the desk heater., Warms up good dont use gasoline around this product Does not get very hot, I use the heater under my desk at work I'm sending this back.  The specs said it was good to 158 farenheit.  It shuts down at 110.  I bought it to kill bedbugs but it doesn't get hot enough. Worked 15 minutes and never came back on. This little heater really puts out some nice heat, and I love the safety features.  However, I need to be able to hear my phone calls and that's difficult with the fan sounds.  If you don't mind the fan sound, this is a great heater.  Quieter than old models, but not quiet home office quiet. Heats space quickly.  Looks nice. The 20 Watt Fan doesn‚Äôt push very much air. Although the heat is sufficient, the fan doesn‚Äôt push it very well... Not as big as I thought It is much louder than I expected, also it has this strong PVC smell, I wouldn't recommend it for these two reasons. Good heat It's ok We used this heater in our camper on cool nights. This little heater has a big attitude when it comes to putting out the heat and we were able to sleep knowing the safety features that this heater has.  It had no trouble keeping our 31ft camper very warm and comfortable and we are very pleased with our purchase. After two days of use it died and would not come on any more Bought Dec 2020 it‚Äôs Feb 2021 and it quit working.Worked well while it lasted. Breaks quickly. Don‚Äôt buy. I love it, it keeps me warm and is easy to set. This little heater really works and for the price my expectations were low but it does the job more than good I would definitely recommend it. Doesn‚Äôt heat up like it supposed to (in my opinion) Maybe lasted a few months before one day it just didn‚Äôt turn on anymore. When it was working, the heater was incredible! Whenever it‚Äôs lifted or knocked over, the heat automatically stops‚Ä¶After a month of use, first the safety features stopped working. Then after a week or so, it stopped turning on all together. Awesome product while it lasted, but it didn‚Äôt even last us 6 months. I used this heater pretty often but never left it on all the time. The outlet and cord got way too hot when it was on for just 5 minutes. It's meant for minimal use maybe? Don't recommend. Compact stable heater. We use it in our camper. It shuts off if tipped over and the front grill never seems to get to hot too the touch. My only dislike is it can be difficult to get the thermostat set to hold the temperature you want. Especially at night. Be sure to run this heater outside on high for at least ten minutes to eliminate odors from the manufacturing process. I must have bought a defective heater because one side blows cold air and the other side is warm. Having connection problems now. Yesterday it worked and today it isn't. So IDK. Disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è We bought two of these for our little pop up trailer they worked awesome. Got very warm in full blast so we had to turn it down some which days allot when it's 37 degrees out side Heat output is very good! good for the price I liked this heater a lot. I used to have one that was 360 heat which was perfect for my husband and I to use outside during the winter months to smoke with. I bought this like 2 months ago in December and I just burnt out this morning. I brought it inside back in December after having it outside with us for a week and wanted to use it in the house but now all of a sudden it burnt out? Why? I‚Äôm really upset because now the price went up and I have to order a new one üòë it works good until it doesn‚Äôt The knob to set the temperature doesn't really do much. I want to run it at night in my room in the basement, but it either runs nonstop until the room is a sauna or not at all until I'm freezing no matter where I set it. heats up great not cold air for fan...fan's temperature is about room temperature This is a good heater, but cold air blows out the side.  Also, the hot air is so hot that you  can't have the heater near you.  Kind of strange, especially if your dogs like to stretch out in front of the heater.  But it keeps a chilly room warm enough. Use to warm the coldest room in my house. Just the amount of heat needed to take the chill out of the early morning without using propane in the RV. It does the job of heating a room, but I need something quiet as I wanted to use this in my office and I am on video/audio calls all day. This is loud enough that my system actually reminds me I'm on mute because it thinks I'm trying to say something. I'll return it but for some folks looking for something small and efficient where the noise is irrelevant it could work. We love having this lil heater in the bathroom. Heats super fast and has 2 settings. Just enough to warm up the bathroom for taking a bath or shower. I used it when my grandsons took a bath. Those lil ones get cold lots quicker than I do, had the ability to increase the heat output with this heater. We really like it! Only negative is that the manual should have been written by someone whose native language was English. Hardly any heat comes out.  Even on high.  If I shut the door to the bedroom it will keep it ok but it stays on all night to keep it comfortable.  Very noisy also. I should have sent it back but I threw the box away etc. Great heater for a great price The main reason I purchased this heater was that it boasted its quiet presence.  It was quite loud and I ended up giving it away and sticking with my older, slightly quieter model. I bought this heater for a bathroom. I like the safety feature - shuts off when it reaches a certain temperature and when the heater is moved while running. I ended up buying two more heaters. The heat output is great! Well worth the money! I love the heater it works good but if I were to use this as a work desk heater I think it would be a little bit too loud and slightly too high of pitched but the heat out put is good also this heater didn't smell like it was going to burn the house down on first start up which was pleasantly surprising I bought this because it has a good rating and plenty of good reviews. But it is a disappointment, it is very light and safe indeed. But it is VERY LOUD, it is blowing air and making much bigger noises than my air conditioner, and honestly only warm out a very small space, like you can use it for you feet. But the noise make me cannot focus on my work so I have to return it. This replaced a 5 year old Lasko ceramic unit; and is superior in heat, safety features, strong construction and properly bottom-weighted to keep it stable.Regardless, I have to take away a point for its noise. Even at its lower setting, the extremely narrow apertures between the heating elements result in a very pronounced 'WOOSH' that has woken me on several occasions.I live in a complex with boiler heat, which gets turned off on May 1st. EVERY ONE of the first 13 nights this may have dropped down anywhere from 47-34 degrees Fahrenheit. I use this in the bedroom, and have a much larger 'milkhouse' style (fan-forced) heater in the living room. That larger heater is no more than 2/3 the volume of this smaller one; but I need it in the larger room.While it does the job, I will be replacing this with a quieter heater by this Fall. Small, inexpensive, and reliable. More than adequate to heat my home office/studio (approx. 150 sq ft.) Nice size, gives off decent amount of heat... but control doesn‚Äôt seems to change much. Cannot use while teaching online  because it is noisy...:(  Cannot hear my kids. It was too noisy for me I use mine in my bathroom just before I shower. When I‚Äôm finished I put it away in my bathroom closet for next time. It prevents chills when coming out. I love mine. Perfect for my currently work at home wife. Just be careful and don't plug into same outlet with anything else. Or within same fuse point. A nice little heater that I use occasionally to warm my home office. At first it seemed to have an odor, but after a couple of uses that was gone. Heats up quickly, does the job. Too small to do the work Great quality. Kept my one bedroom apt warm Great product I bought this to heat my garage so when I work out in it I am comfortable.  It works for this small enclosed space.  The safety features are spot on! Smells terrible. Will be returning it. Even three days later.. the room continues to smell where the heater sits Works great, but it broke after 6 weeks.  I returned it for another.  All good with the return.  The new one broke after 10 weeks.  So I just bought another since I am outside the return window.  Hope this makes it through the chilly weather.  So whats that a two star or three?  I gave it two . . . it really shouldn't break twice. Worked well for about 2 months. Then stopped working. Kicks out serious heat in a short amount of time. Stopped heating consistently in under two months Worked for a week. Fan stopped working. Save your money and buy something else that will last. It‚Äôs small and easy to move and fits in little places. Doesn‚Äôt give off a lot of heat unless you are within 3-4 inches in front of it. Got this for our daughter‚Äôs room so we could keep the rest of the house cool at night and it is so inconsistent. The concept seems simple enough: warm the room to desired temp and set the thermostat. We are going off the temp on the baby monitor since this unit doesn‚Äôt have a temperature display. Some nights she wakes up cold because her room is 68 and others she is sweating because her room is 82. The heater either doesn‚Äôt turn on, or it does, then doesn‚Äôt turn off. This space heater is the perfect size to keep under my desk! I love the different settings and the safety feature that turns it off if it tips over! It was not what I wanted.  It was electric. The only room in my house this can keep heated is my 10x10 bedroom when the door is closed. It makes very little impact if the room is any larger. Great little heater. Loved it. One year after purchase on Amazon heater stopped working. Problem is the Auto-Tilt-Off feature started to trigger all the time, whether the unit was standing flat or not. So now the heater will never go on, even though it is not tilted. Still, it only cost $35 or so. So I sort of rented it for one year. :) I really liked this heater.  It was nice and warm and small but mighty.  But all the sudden one day it stopped working.  I had it for about two months and used it only a handful of times.  It is clearly the small safely mechanism on the bottom.  It works if I push it in with my finger but not just sitting on its own. Heats really well but it's SO noisy. You can't have it on and watch tv. Can't believe quiet operation was one of their selling points. Still, I did keep it. I like that it's small and does heat well Stopped working in less than a year.. I used this for two months a few hours each day. It suddenly stopped working and now won‚Äôt turn on at all. Definitely disappointing. It worked okay while it worked, but lasted less than a month before it's started squealing and died. Your room better be warm to begin with. Light weight and does exactly what is says. Not as quiet as expected, but reasonable. This is a great heater for my office, but it is very noise.  That's the reason for the three stars.  It heats up fast and is very comfortable.  Just a bit loud when people come to my office to meet. Working in an office the temperature is never right. So this heater and fan combo works great! There is a safety feature so if it tips over it shuts off automatically. There are temperature controls as well so if you don't want it too hot you can adjust the dial. Great product and not to expensive. I'm not sure what happened here but I used this for about 1 hour a day for 3 weeks and it randomly and pooped out unprovoked. It worked well while it worked. All of the sudden it shut off and stopped working. Do not recommend. Complete junk. Stops working entirely after a couple months This product is not built to last.  I've bought two of these now (returned the first one and exchanged it) and both of them lasted about two months before they broke.  During that time, the heater did a decent job of heating up my living room.  I can't complain about that, but two months of working operation is ridiculous!  The biggest problem might be a selling point for a lot of people.  For fire safety, there is a little safety switch on the bottom that automatically turns the heater off if it tips over and loses contact with the floor or whatever surface is underneath it.  This mechanism is very cheaply made.  It is basically a little piece of plastic with a peg attached to some kind of spring and this thing is guaranteed to wear out in a very short period of time, and unfortunately, when that mechanism wears out, you won't be able to turn the heater on anymore.  This second safety switch actually wore out about a month after I received my second one.  I ended up taping it down, but I only got another month of use out of it.  It just died!  Oh, well.  At least it's spring time.  The two I bought got me through the winter... But that was all this thing was good for.  I'd  invest a little more money if you can as this heater proves the old adage: You get what you pay for!So why does this have a high rating?  Because the first two months of use, the heater works really well, and I bet that's when people write most of their reviews.  It would really help the consumer for people to delete or amend these positive reviews.... Or maybe they got much luckier and got way more use out of this heater than I did.  Somehow I doubt that. Love that the unit is small and light weights but it is SO loud compared to my last space heater.  I do like the safety cut off feature.  It also doesn‚Äôt heat the room as well as my last unit."
66,"REVLON One-Step Hair Dryer And Volumizer Hot Air Brush, Black, Packaging May Vary",Beauty and Personal Care,"At first it was working fine But when I traveled to another area, I turned it on, and smoke and the smell of fire came out of it, and after that it no longer works, I only used it 5 times The barrel was too large Love this tool -- its perfect and creates a professional blow out look in half the time!  The only grip is it get super hot. I was hesitant to buy this product but I finally broke down and purchased it. I am glad I did because I love it and it‚Äôs the only way I dry my hair now. It is very easy to use and drys my hair fairly quick. It leaves my hair smooth and soft. Love it!! The blowing power goes up and down. I‚Äôve checked the plugs (my house is 15 years old) so it‚Äôs not the electric. I know people who have the same one and theirs doesn‚Äôt do it . Concerned it may catch fire. Using with caution $50 is a lot to toss out. I love this hairstyling tool!  It is so convenient to have the brush and the blow dryer in one.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Well worth the purchase! it only lasted three months, bristles broke and started to burn after three months ,only used it once a week. Need more temperature or blow levels When I received this, I immediately realized it was meant for longer hair...at least in my opinion.  I have medium length, fine, thin hair.  The brush is HUGE!!!  Probably great for volume, but not for curls.  I returned it without using it. Like the product. Would buy again and the product description was correct. I loved this dryer brush... However after only a month of use (only 5 times total hair dries) the motor is dying.  Very disappointed Even on mornings when I don‚Äôt think I have time for a blow dry I can get blowout quality hair in less than 10 min. This thing is worth every penny.*I have straight hair that doesn‚Äôt not have any curl to it. Only dryer I use on my hair now. Highly recommend. Got this on prime day because I kept reading about it everywhere.  It‚Äôs a fine dryer but I don‚Äôt see any advantages.  Doesn‚Äôt make my hair straighter, smoother, or have more volume.  After a while (and you need a while bc it doesn‚Äôt work very well) it gets really hot.  It‚Äôs also heavy.  I used it about 6-7 times and got rid of it.  For reference my normal dryer is a Dyson. I don't use this tool very often. I bought it in April 2021 and have used it maybe 3 times. Worked well enough the times I used it. I went to use it this morning for the 4th time, and about 30 seconds into using it, the handle started to get hot. Then it started to smell like burning, and then it started smoking. Luckily I unplugged it before it burst into flames and hurt me. Unfortunately my window to return it is way past, but I certainly would like to warn anyone looking to spend money on this item. Not worth it! It gets too hot and burns hair. A bit loud and hard to manage if you don‚Äôt know how to maneuver it, but the end result is amazing!! Dries quickly and so easy. I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have the mechanics to do it but it‚Äôs so natural. Get it! Product worked great for the first 2 weeks, then it quit heating. Now just blows air at room temp. Tried both high and low, same. This hair dryer smoothes my hair as it dries it unlike a basic hair dryer that makes my hair more frizzy. This dryer also helps with straightening my hair during the drying process. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because it does take a little longer than a basic dryer to dry the hair and it‚Äôs a little difficult to use on short hair After using it a few times, I plugged it in and it immediately caught on fire. I had to place it on the concrete porch outside immediately. Used one. Easy to use and works really well to dry/style fast. Only has high, low, and cool settings and can get very hot while on high. Difficult to get your roots, but still shortens blow drying time by a lot. The hairdryer worked wonderfully for about the first 3 years. Very easy to get a professional, salon style to my hair without a lot of effort and accomplishing this rather quickly! However, after a few short years the plastic two-prong electrical plug cracked and separated at the seam, exposing the ‚Äòhot‚Äô electrical wires, a definite safety threat. Had to be discarded. It was great while it lasted. Too bulky to use LITERALLY HAD IT FOR A MONTH AND JUST SHUT OFF AS I WAS USING IT. WASTE OF MONEYYYYYY I CANT EVEN RETURN IT TO GET A NEW ONE. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ALSO. DO NOT BUY THIS Really easy to style your hair with this product! It does have 3 settings for temperature control high, low, cool. However, on the high setting it does seem to get too hot after a few minutes of use. Could have been smaller. I absolutely loved this dryer but it died after less than a year. I used it on average 2 times a week and it worked amazing. I guess I don‚Äôt mind buying one every year but it would be nice if you didn‚Äôt have to so I‚Äôll be going with a different brand for my replacement in hopes that it‚Äôll last a few years like a regular dryer.  I was disappointed in that because I‚Äôve had my regular blow dryer for almost 10 years. It does work great though while it lasted! Made an awful noise after a few months and starting burning on the inside. Do not recommend. I really love this hair dryer got it for christmas i use it once a week now out of nowhere it stopped working Excelente Love the fact it‚Äôs two in one. Much easier than having to use a brush and dryer. This is only good for very thick strong hair when hair breakage won't be noticed. It is only very high heat and the hair is so close to the brush/heated part that it can be damaged quickly.  I have fine and thin hair so I use this on low, which is still not low enough.  It has a cool setting, but the cool setting is too warm, not cool at all.  It dries hair so quickly, like being close to a hot flame would dry hair!  It is damaging.  I've had it a year and didn't use it often at first, bu found that when I did it smoothed my hair out quickly, but if I used it often, like twice a week,  It would have fried the ends for sure.  Secondly, its very loud, louder than a blow dryer, and I wish I would have returned it. Bought in December, use approximately 1 to 2 times per week. Within two months, the heat control started to go, so I used it cooler. Now, the motor is gone and it's started smoking. It's going in the trash, and I'll work on finding a better product to replace it. This hair dryer was great while it lasted! I've had it since 2019 and now it completely stopped working. My 'regular' hair dryer is going on 10 years! Don't waste your money. I love this‚Ä¶style time down to 4 minutes with a smooth finish. My hair actually is softer and looks healthier after styling. I love it!! I use it every day and it is great. Personal I would  like the small diameter brush. Didn‚Äôt check that. I have owned this for little over one year and don‚Äôt use it every day and the motor has already burned out. Hopefully I can get it replaced. This is very hard to use! Save your money and get something better! Started off working great. Straightened my hair nicely and gave it great volume. (I have long, thick, course hair). After 3 months of owning it..using it maybe twice month...it no longer performs as well as it did. I've owned another blowbrush before that lasted me over a year. Was pretty disappointed with this product. I did love this item but it stopped working.  I purchased it last October.  I only used it once a week,very disappointed. The entire machine gets so hot within seconds you cannot hold it I love how it works and how my hair is dried and styled at the same time. The handle is quite large to hold on to and takes some getting used. The temperature runs pretty hot - there is a ‚Äúcool‚Äù but would be nice to have a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù I love this brush dryer. It‚Äôs great for smooth hair and touch ups if blowouts. My only complaint is that the handle has a wide diameter. It is hard to hold at times compared to a round brush and separate dryer. It is HOT and the cool works but not as cool as I would like to smooth the hair cuticle and set the style. The high settting stopped working after only a couple of uses This thing was way bigger than I thought it would be, like annoyingly big. My hair is bobbed and I used a couple of times but still had to use a straightener after on the back of head. I have a little natural curl, but this dryer is too big, using sides only, to maximize curl.  If you have straight hair, you will love it. Tooooooooo loud‚Ä¶.. sounds like a 747 plane on the runway‚úàÔ∏è. It‚Äôs really quite unfortunate because everything else about it was exactly what I was looking for ergonomically, power, size,  very unfortunate. Maybe this is something they could work on, because it seems I was not the only one that experienced hearing loss well trying to dry their hairü§™ The One Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer is a great tool, except mine has died after just 7 months of light use.  I will order another one but I am very disappointed that the motor has died.  I used it maybe 2x a week at most! After the 3rd use, it started smelling horribly and smoke came out of it.  I am afraid to use it again.. Unfortunately  it is too late to return it. Would not buy it again. This dryer/styler works great!  It‚Äôs super easy and I use it often.  My only complaint is the temp is quite hot, even on low. Great for the value . Powerful and easy to use Wish I had purchased one of these sooner. Cuts dry time tremendously and styles nice without having to use two tools. Overall, great hair effect. But the dryer was so loud that after using it only once I was dizzy. Had problem sleeping. Would have loved it if it wasn't for the noise level. I really wanted this to work but it didn't help me.  The hair dryer/brush is very big and heavy. This must be for the young, strong people.  My arm gave out before I was able to dry my whole head of hair. It was very difficult to use on the back of my head and I don't think it gave out enough air to dry thoroughly. Even the part that I did dry left my hair a bit frizzy. I ended up giving it away. I like that it works. I like it doesn‚Äôt get tangled in my hair. I do NOT like how loud this hair dryer is. It stopped working properly.  No longer heats up.. My hair was too short to use. I had a hotshot and loved it until it stopped working. Since I only had it for a little over a year before it stopped working I thought I‚Äôd try a different brand. If you don‚Äôt mind very loud blow dryer then this blow dry will be fine. I was thoroughly impressed with this! Cut my straightening time to 30 minutes from an hour. Left my hair voluminous and soft. The drying power was good. It was loud like a blow dryer as well. Only reason I took some stars away was because it stopped working out of nowhere. Won‚Äôt even turn on now. Little large, but it works nicely and I would recommend it. Didn't like how works. Bought another one before and thought this one was better but was wrong. My hair sits on mu shoulders and I have bangs.  The brush is too big for my bangs.  I had to return it. I am disgusted. This box looked like it may have been opened when it arrived. I opened it up and saw that it had definitely been used- there was someone else's hair in the bristles of the brush. This is completely unacceptable, unsanitary, and unsafe. Disgusting, Amazon! A smaller version would be better. Enjoyed using this brush, although a bit heavy.  Sadly it lasted about two years & I used it about once a week. Makes Curley hair straight. Probably a wonderful product if you have shorter or layered hair however money too long and it get tangled and pulled out my hair. My sister loves hers Don‚Äôt buy...I‚Äôd just buy the dyson one instead.This is Bella cheap...worked for a month and now makes a loud sound when turned on... This product has excellent drying power and it is easy to use.  The price of this item is hard to beat. If you have a coupon your an buy it for $35.00 I loved this dryer in the beginning.  Bought it in January and used it several times per week. I received so many compliments on my hair looking like a salon blowout.  Now it's August and the heat setting no longer works. It only blows cold air, so now it's useless.  It's past the return window, so I threw it in the garbage.  Don't waste your money. , not powerful. I have curly hair (2C) and wear it curly most of the time. This dry my hair very quickly, but it makes it look puffy not voluminous. It got a lot of frizz and felt tosted. My sister-in-law have wavy hair and it works very good for her, but she also straight her her all the time. I almost cancelled the order because of some reviews here but I‚Äôm glad I ended up going through with the purchase! They have added a low setting which works perfectly for me and it‚Äôs so convenient to use! I bought this to ease my arm pain of drying with a brush. It doesn‚Äôt exactly get the same blowout but it‚Äôs much much easier and quicker I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs going to fry my hair as the temperature feels way to hot. It does what it claims to do but I‚Äôm not sure how long my hair can take it. Easy to use. Able to dry and style at the same time. Item stopped working after 4-5 uses only It would be helpful to give sizes that would correspond with hair length This was a great, very affordable blowout brush for a few months. Then it stopped producing heat making the good airflow fairly useless. Didn‚Äôt work for my hair a blow dryer is just fine Best thing invented I loved this product... had it for about a month or two and it was incredible. However, I traveled to Europe and the first time I plugged it in it started sparking and ended up burning my hair. On top of that, the bristles on the brush itself actually melted off completely! I called the customer service line and they were extremely helpful. They informed me that this product is not a dual voltage machine and by taking it outside of the US I effectively voided the 4-year warranty. They also said that most of the issues they've seen have come from people not taking the hair out of the brush after each use. This causes the air holes in the dryer to become blocked, forcing the motor to overheat.  I'm planning on purchasing again, I just wish this information had been made clear before traveling. Hope this helps. Absolutely love how easy and amazing this works! I returned it for two reasons: brush way too big for my shoulder length hair , especially for the shorter front hairs which I wasn‚Äôt able to straighten with this huge brush and zero way of adjusting the temperature it felt like it was burning my hair and scalp so no thanks . Super loud & burns hair, tried it several times & doesn‚Äôt leave hair smooth but frizzy! Wish I could return it but missed my window. Love the color, the texture, and how easy it is to use  it is a little on the heavier side, so I have to use both hands most of the time. I still like that I don‚Äôt need tue brush and the drier all the time. I have thick, shoulder length hair and this has cut my drying time to about 20 minutes and now I don‚Äôt use the flat iron after, even in the summer humidity. I recommend it. Used it maybe twice a week if that.... Maybe 3 times a month and it already burned out on me. Bought on May, died in July. I really loved it when it worked, but it only lasted me 4 months and I do not blow dry my hair everyday. Now, it only blows out cool air. Love the temperature control. Is heavier than I thought, but is not bad at all. Take me around 15min to dry and straight my hair.  And leave my hair with some volume.  Love it. bought this in september 2020, absolutely love the product but literally just started smoking and smells like burnt hair. I clean it out so i know its not that. I also dont wash my hair every day so its not being over used, maybe two to three times a week. very disappointed. Blow dries my hair beautifully.  I have long straight fine hair but a lot of it.  Takes a long time to dry naturally.  Leaves hair smooth and shiny.  Barrel is a little too large to produce any curl but I don't use any product either so this may be a factor. When it starts or stays on, this dryer brush works great. However, it doesn't turn on everytime. I have to reset, move the cord, and make multiple attempts. I'm not sure if it is a cord issue or what. I wish it would work consistently each time because I love the way it straightens my hair when it starts. How do I return it?  It did not turn on anymore and I would like to return it or change it for one that works, I already read the return policies but I do not know in which part I request the return It was good while it lasted. I used it twice and it didnt work on my third attempt. It doesnt turn on. Didnt return cause i got rid of the box. This purchase was a total failure. My go to when I don‚Äôt want to use my straightener. I love how it makes my hair look shiny! Very easy to use. The only issue I have is how loud it is. Easy to use and fast at drying, but beware: this gets hot! (And I don't feel like the ""cool"" setting really does much.) If you have thin/brittle hair, I would think twice before ordering this product for that reason alone.I found that the soft bristles (which are meant to put tension on the hair) compressed/lost shape pretty quickly which was rather disappointing, but it's still a much better alternative then a separate brush and blow dryer! I am disabled and have trouble with normal dryers. This makes my life so much easier. I bought this product when it first came out a few years ago and it worked great- loved it- gave my hair the look of both a blow out and having been through a flat iron. It stopped working after 18 months. This one is a replacement and it is okay- not as amazing on the shine but still better than a regular hair dryer. The Revlon dryer brush is a little bulky on the handle and a little heavy, making it a little difficult to grab and stretch the hair from the root, maybe it should have longer wire bristles. However, I am happy with my purchase since it shorten a little the process of drying and flat ironing my hair It works great.  No frizz!  There are 2 things I dislike.  1. It is very bulky for my small hands so it's a little difficult to use, but still better than holding a brush and a hair dryer.  2.  I keep burning my finger on the little section between the handle and the brush.  Because of the bulkiness of the handle, in order to get a good grip and not drop it, I seem to move my hand up closer to the brush.  Eventually I'll learn to control it better.  It will take a while because I seldom use a dryer from late spring to mid fall.  It's just too hot to use a dryer during that time period. I thank good for this product it changed my life my hair is smooth and healthy and it‚Äôs so easy Last week, the device started to make a noise like the motor was dying. Then today, it became a noise scary and loud enough to send my toddler screaming and sobbing into the other room (he was observing my make-up/grooming). I realize hair dryers' lives come to an end, but that end should not be after 28 uses. I bought this for myself for Christmas 2020 (Mom life purchasing my own gifts), and started using it in Jan. 2021. It's end came today, August 6, 2021. This is unacceptable and disappointing. I really liked this at first but after 4 months it seemed to be over heating. To the point that I couldn't even hold the tip, which is for control purposes. It ended up giving me 2nd to 3rd degree burns on one of my ears. I've had to discontinue use.  It took me awhile to realize that it has caused a lot of damage to my hair. Burning the ends and making it fall out. It is very heavy and larger than I expected Much too big for me. The roller head is for someone with long hair which I don‚Äôt have.  Maybe if I had long hair, this product would have worked. I like how this product dried my hair relatively fast. However, using this tool has damaged my hair. The heating power is too much for my fine hair to handle. If you have hair that is already normal to thin I would pass on this. Very helpful I love this‚Ä¶ it has significantly cut down on the time it takes to style my hair. I just hate how loud it is‚Ä¶ I have to stuff my ears with cotton balls so the noise is bearable. I love the way it works, I am really happy with it. I just wish the handle was much smaller. Very heavy on the hand, I had to stop using wish it was not heavy Dryer didn't last long. Purchase it for Christmas starting using it in late December went to 4/22 DOAProduct doesn't last.  Stay away. Amazon purchase has a 30 day warranty. other stores have more. FYI I loved this blow dryer.  When it worked.  This is the second one I have purchased that lasted only a few months.  I would like a refund or a new hair dryer. I love this hot air brush!!  Wow, its awesome!  While I put on my make-up, I air dry my hair and then use a hair dryer for a minute or two to dry it some more because its thick.  I then put it in sections and begin using this amazing brush.....when I'm done with all my hair, it looks wonderful, full and all my frizzies are gone! I highly recommend this! normal It works great for me. I have really frizzy hair with some waves. My hair looked so smooth and shiny. I didn‚Äôt have to use my straightener. I love it aside from it coming with a few bristles bent. Unfortunately, I had to return this. My hairdresser said it was too big to create the volume I need. Other than that, it worked very well for drying and smoothing may hair and was easy to maneuver. The cool setting wasn‚Äôt cool enough. Thank you muy agradecido Easy to use and thick hair dries fast! No need to use a straightener with this: blows hair dry and straight all at the same time. The ‚Äúhot‚Äù setting does get HOT. Would need to supervise youngsters. I have really thick, prone to frizz, curly hair. If I wait till my hair is damp (not soaking wet) then it‚Äôs a quick blowout. It‚Äôs lightweight but loud, the brush section itself gets reeeeaaally hot so be careful! I dropped it and grabbed the hottest part by accident and burned myself.Make sure you use a thermal protector for your hair, it def gets very very hot. Nice features but too heavy for me. Love this product! But it lost its ability to heat up randomly after 2 months of use, was not dropped or damaged in any way, just stopped getting hot one day. Dryer died 1 day after return possible date(31 days) used 2 times a week I got this brush in Dec 2019 and LOVED it for the first 20-30 times I used it. Sadly this past weekend it stopped working and just blows cool air out now, the heating coils must have broken. Not sure why as it was just sitting in a drawer and suddenly stopped working one day. Too loud. Purchased in October on 2020. The other day my wife was using it and it started smoking really bad! Cause one of my upstairs smoke detectors to go off!! Stopped working one month in. Love this. My hair is very curly and takes about an hour to fully straighten. I now can dry and straighten my hair in maybe less than 20 minutes. I only have to touch up a few pieces when I‚Äôm finished. Makes getting ready so fast. I get good volume too. Please note I'm only giving this product 3 stars due to my experience with my type of hair. I don't personally feel that this product is a bad product, maybe just not right for my type of hair. First, I will definitely say I have very fine, no volume hair, that is why I was truly hoping for a better result. Honestly it really didn't do much for my hair other that make it feel extremely HOT. I've applied several different types of hair styling products prior to blowing out my hair. Which does help, but certainly not the result I would have liked. I do agree with some of the reviews, it is quite loud but I could get over that if it did more for my hair. I haven't decided to return the product or continue to try different techniques for better results. Either way if you do have very fine / thin hair, I probably wouldn't recommend this particular hot air brush. It‚Äôs too big not good for scanty hair Dries well but gets too hot and fried my hair. Would constantly smoke. When I plugged it in, it smoked and never turned on. I usually let my hair dry a little before blow drying to lesson heat time but I love this thing it's amazing and easy to use my hair is beach curls very lose texture and it does a great job it worked on my nieces thicker hair just as well I have curly hair and this cuts my getting ready time in half at least. Wish I would have found this years ago very loud I absolutely love drying my hair now. It used to take me about 15-20 minutes just because I don‚Äôt have the arm muscle to do the constant turning motion with a round brush. This does it for you. It takes me five minutes now and my hair has so much more volume and bounciness. I am so happy I made the purchase. I like the fact that this smooths and styles while it dries.  I always used a regular hair dryer and a round brush on my hair.  Now I partially dry my hair with just a regular dryer (no brush) and then use this to add volume.  While it does a very nice job the one item to note is that it‚Äôs a bit heavy and my arm gets tired using it.  The other thing is that the brush portion is NOT round on the one that I received - it‚Äôs oval.  Don‚Äôt know if that makes a difference but this tool works for me. A great gift.  Dries and smooths hair so well. Too loud. Didn't curl my hair, just blew it all around. I received this brush on a Friday, and I immediately used it. It seemed very convenient to use, because I did not have use a hairdryer and a brush. On Monday I decided to use it again, but about 10 min. after I started using it, it started to smell burnt. It shut off. I let it cool down, but it never turned back on again. So I started a return. Then I waited a couple more days, but it did not work, so I returned it. Blow dry brush started sparking and now won‚Äôt even heat up, have used it maybe 10 times. Extremely disappointed Can‚Äôt believe how well it works .Only takes a fraction of the time that my flatiron takes. From one use and it has loud noise and get smoke like something burn Supper disappointed with this junky appliance. Too big of a brush,  the unit itself is  bulky  with cheap bristles means a no - go from me. Amazing product I have naturally curly, medium length hair and have found this to be a good product for a blow-out. It weighs about the same as a traditional hair dryer so that took a little to get used to with a curling motion. I do find myself using two hands at times. Tip: Drying is not as powerful as a hairdryer so I tend to put my makeup on or let my hair towel dry for about ten-20 minutes before drying. Con: This is my second one in less than a year‚Ä¶I got a couple pieces of hair wrapped around it causing a horrible noise. My husband took the whole thing a part and cleaned it out and it still didn‚Äôt sound right. We decided to purchase the second one because myself and my daughter (daughter has long straight hair) liked the results. So far so good. 3 star rating purely because of the replacement within a year, weight and low drying power  when compared to a traditional hair dryer. The power is great and it is easy to use. However, there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòmedium‚Äô heat. It‚Äôs either cold or so hot it literally burns the scalp. I like this ok but it‚Äôs very wide and SO LOUD. My neighbors can hear it through the wall. I honestly wish I‚Äôd returned it but I was too late. this is awesome. make your hair super shiny and smooth easy to use/. When I first received this I thought the brush was too big and would be too difficult to use. I was pleasantly surprised to realize it works very well for styling and dries my thick hair much faster than a regular hair dryer. I would recommend this product. Great device that is easy to use Not a fan of this styling tool. My mom had one that I used at her house and I liked it. Didn‚Äôt know the brand so I bought something that looked similar. Well I‚Äôm just not a fan. It feels like cheap plastic, is big and unwieldy, and doesn‚Äôt seem any better, faster, or easier than using a normal brush and dryer. Would return if I still could. I bought it for me as i thought it would be easy for me to use after having two strokes but it's too big to hold in my left hand. Big and very heavy. I loved the product but it broke and stopped working after the first use.."
67,"RawChemistry Pheromone Cologne, for Him [Attract Formula] - Bold, Extra Strength Formula 1 oz.",Beauty and Personal Care,"Worst product i ever bought on amazon, i normally don't write reviews but this product made me regret that i bought it. First of all its water down perfume. Second the price they are charging for 1 oz is crazy.Just my 2 cents. The scent was fine but doesn't last for more then a hour, its like a cheap cologne but costly. So, I looked up best colognes for 2020. This popped out as number one and with a link directly to Amazon. It was cheap, so I said why and ordered it. Did know it was ""pheromones"" lol but it last long and smells nice. Don't know bout the ""pheromones"" though. Not sure if it works This Smells just as good as the expensive colognes you can find at the mall. Has a great masculine woody scent. I don‚Äôt know if the pheromones work, but I definitely get compliments on the smell. Will definitely purchase again. Love this stuff!!! Arrived in my mailbox as a frozen ice cube.Don't recommend ordering this in winter.A pleasant cologne scent but unsure of its effect. I DK if this really works. I can tell you that the bottle ours came and leaks a lot so you get it all over your hands just picking it up to spray it on.  The fragrance is OK but I found myself using the regular cologne my kids got me.  I think psychologically it might give a person a bit of a boost of confidence when you're wanting to have any type of edge  when dealing with the public. Reading all the positive reviews and being a cynic I went ahead and ordered a bottle.  It smell clean and fresh almost like cool water cologne.  It is not overpowering but only last for 4 hours max.  We all have different body chemistry and the same cologne will smell a little different on most people.  Your mind is a powerful thing and I believe for the positive reviews it is just that people's confidence rose when they wore this cologne.  It is build on hype and people's hopes. IT DOES NOT WORK except to trick your mind and maybe that is what some of us need to take that extra step. The bottle came half empty. it smells incredible and lasts a long time however id like to recieve a replacement or somehing along those lines Not overpowering.  Not overpriced.  I Like that it is  a small business and made by hand. Over priced, over rated It smells okay but kind of smells like roach spray........ That's the best way I can explain it. And it doesn't last long at all. this product smells good, but I notice zero difference in attraction with or without it.  Better to stick with simply exercising, eating right, sleeping properly, and using the money you would have spent on this for a gym membership to be physically in better shape and thereby more attractive and healthier. Unprovable effects or results. Smelled nice like a good quality aftershave lotion. My last bottle was kind of  leaking everyday fron the top. This one doesn't. But, it's not the same quality any more. Scent lasted all of 5 minutes I don‚Äôt recommend this product. Just a perfume, nothing else This cologne smells really good. I really love it, however, it lasts for about an hour and wears off. So if you plan on getting this, keep it on you and spraying it every now and then. very nice smell...does not last long!!! and does not seem to have effect at all. The smell is the only thing that saves this product Like the smell Do not purchase. I have bought this cologne a few years ago, and I loved it since then. This is def not a bad cologne depending on what you normally use. I am more of a Versaci or Gucci fan, but decided to give this a try. While this scent does smell pretty good, it fades really fast. And the whole ""Pheromone"" thing i think is a bit of a stretch but does tend to be a talking point assuming its freshly sprayed and the ""company"" likes it. Not sure if it really helps.. but at least it gives you a little more confidence? Smells great, good for casual or formal wear. I'd say for me it differently gives me a confidence boost! Great purchase. I love this cologne, all though I would call it an oil. I use it by itself, or I mix it with my other colognes. I call it dressing my nose, but anyway, goes great with my natural body odor. Women always compliment me on how good I smell. I do suggest layering it to make it kind of enhance the cologne your wearing. It goes best with brighter scents, but it also compliments more manly scents like Dior Saavage. So I give this a 5. I am def going to buy again. NO CAP!!! Gets compliments all the time more than any other cologne I've ever tried, it's kind of weird actually. More women talked to me but i'm not impressed with this product. Would not buy this product again. Spray cap leaks at fitting. Squirts, does not spray. And the seal of the spray assembly leaks. Especially when warm. Bought it for cologne, not some magic potion. Because it does not work by controlling others' behavior or drive. Around people constantly. Zero change in feedback. The cap for this fell apart during normal use. The two parts with the spring between them came separated and it spilled out. Very frustrated bc the bottle didn‚Äôt contain very much fluid. Smells good though. No noticeable effect on my wife Just trying it out...like it so far. The scent was very nice, didn‚Äôt smell like alcohol. I can tell that a couple of women enjoyed the scent as well. Value was great compared to others! This is my third bottle of this cologne. I love it‚Äôs scent! It smells amazing and came just in time for my vacation! I didn like it made me feel nauseous Well now second bottle and no good reaction from any women this will be the last one I was looking for something that had a long lasting scent, this did it I can put it on in the morning and at night after work I still smell great, and it's a good price to I bought this to impress some women at work, each one of them told me I smell either like a dead person or a low class hooker This is a pure fiction after using 3 month I quit because it's very grease Gr8 4 laying up wit yo boo thang didn't work This cologne has a sweet smell. I purchased it because of its popularity. Don't expect women to follow you home! Basic smell, not a fan. Meh No complaints, but also no compliments. Great smell hope it works as good as it smellso Smells great and long lasting I don‚Äôt like perfume Not the worst but also not the best product. Sucks don't buy. I'm a good looking guy with a good personality but this sucks Haven't showered in months. This helps. Product smell good but don't expect miracles. Major bs was losing1 spay when putting lid back on.hoped it was a one off, pressurising and squirting everytime, you put lid back on.I got another and that one is doing the same thing.so wasting it everytime i replace the lid.?That makes 2 in a row Don't think it works as a pheromone for attraction or whatever, the studies and science on that are shaky at best. But great scent, and will be buying it for that again. 3 stars for misleading product and overhyped. Applies thick and lasts all day Put the spray on, and about 10 mins later my fiance could smell it and asked if I put it on. Than proceeded to lay on me and now she's waiting for me to finish this üòÖGuys if you want to have some fun, buy this. It's definitely worth a rebuy No fragrance at all. It seemed like a placebo or water. Returned for refund Smells great but the container leaks really bad and with every use you get it all over your hands and it can make oil stains on you clothes if it drips on it Nothing special about it Don't  work for me. One of my co-workers is a female she came in one day in the break room and she comes in and says what's that good smell I started to laugh. It was packaged well, nice box.....the cologne has a good scent to it ..but it is so weak ..I sprayed myself 3 times in the morning and an 1 hour later you couldn't even smell it. And if you spray it directly onto your skin it will leave to spot super oilly and it takes a while to dry.... First time I bought it, did not care for it. Overall it is a great smelling cologne.. I work in an office and service serval clients on a day to day basis, what I would call a perfect testing ground for this product. So here‚Äôs the scoop:I don‚Äôt know if it is more of a boost in confidence which may lead to favoritism amongst clients Of opposite sex or the pheromones but  I did notice on a couple of occasions where a friendlier more playful mood was evoked which sometimes a playful touch or two was noticed.It doesn‚Äôt seem to work with all women but the ones it did work with I noticed an almost hypnotic like state where the smell seemed to capture the subject and send them to the moon and back.I wish it came in a larger size.. 2 applications a day for longevity..it is oil based so watch out for oils stains (which wash out).I‚Äôm most likely going to buy again. This product did not do anything.  My experience with women was no different.  The only reason that I gave it 2 stars is because is smells okay. Straight garbage!!!! I like the way it smells and my wife sure like when i use it Disappointed in this product scent doesn't last out of the bathroom to the bedroom let alone until you get out of the house It‚Äôs good stuff, I am happy with it, i bought it as a experiment, now I want something stronger though. Love the smell. Sometimes it will leave residue so best to apply to skin not clothes. Awesome scent!! Excelente Smelled nice. A bit strong... but I probably sprayed too mich Great smell, and my lady loves it Lasts for 10 minutes and that‚Äôs all and it has a weird after smell. Almost like a bad after taste with a food, this has a weird smell after There was no scent no longevity, stain your clothes with the oils. Very disappointed. I bought this a little while back, and recently began using it for the first time. The scent is pleasant. The first two times I sprayed the bottle, the sprayer worked as one would expect. After those initial uses, however, the sprayer quit misting and began spitting out the cologne in a hesitant stream. With a malfunctioning pump, as my bottle seems to have, it is difficult to apply it evenly, so I have to settle for spots of cologne instead of an even mist. I usually apply cologne to my clothing, and I don't feel as if concentrated application spots are an effective means of using it.As for the effectiveness of the pheromone aspect of the cologne, it is difficult to determine, as my ability to use it has been severely limited. As I said earlier, however, it does smell nice. It also seems to be evaporating at a faster rate than my other (regular) colognes. Not what I quite expected but I expect to use it. Awesome fragrance....but it seems the seal on the one I received was damaged...the entire bottled leaked out in the box it came in. Stuff smells amazing.But its not a magic wand...  it will open the door to conversation, its an ice breaker for sure when out trying to meet someone new you will know who is interested in you immediatly and the rest is up to you.Now if you have someone you know is already into you this will make them go crazy.I would best describe this as a confidence inhancer ! I tend to be alot bolder when wearing this. the oil from the product stained my shirts It was terrible order to bu I love the scent but not once has anybody gave me any compliments when I wore it. It‚Äôs very greasy so apply with care as it can stain or may be noticeable on skin. The bottle didn‚Äôt last that long and doesn‚Äôt hold a lot and I had issues where the top of the lid came off where it wasn‚Äôt supposed to. The packaging is great and the smell is wonderful but again, I never had women say anything to me and I wore it to church and on travels to LA and nothing. You probably won‚Äôt get dates or laid wearing this but if you do they may like the scent if they are up close but my ex didn‚Äôt even get turned on by it at all. It‚Äôs not some magically thing that will make girls want you more or like you better but it does smell nice. I just wish it had lasted longer since I am out now and the price is more than I want to pay since it didn‚Äôt do much for me. Great smell, very little goes a long way and it lasts all day.  This is bottle #5 for me. the flagrance didn't last at all. I like the smell. Very smooth. Was so excited because box it came in looked so well made and usually the box comes is reflection on product but not the case here smelt great at first but DOES SCENT DOEA LAST LONG AT ALL ;( product blends really well with my natural scent! plus i got some free things today, just cause, so that was nice Not good.... I receive compliments shells frequently The scent is the reason women like it. Women enjoy smells of a more natural variety and this cologne sums of that smell quite well it's very good for the price also Sent short lasting I wish I could review this but I never got anyone to smell it. This perfume never never lasts with me!!!! Is my unit faulty? nice product nothing overpowering The smell is amazing, cute bottle, nice packaging smell amazing Couldn‚Äôt see much of a difference thought. It‚Äôs all in your mind I guess. Being honest. You have to be looking to find. It doesn't smell unique and didn't last long Smells good but fades away kind of quickly Cheap, Smells great, My girl rated it a 9 out of ten. But it is an oil not a normal cologne just doesn't last as i had hoped Crap The smell doesn't last long it fades away quick Not working smell is not good Product stinks and a few girls said it awful smelling !!!! Product smells great for about 1-2 hours but only projects about 2 ft maybe 3 if just applied ..after about 2 hours some one will only smell this if giving you a hug ..love the scent but wish it lasted longer and the scent would project more than 2-ft I like it but it fades very fast and the smell is just the middle of the road. I don‚Äôt know if this works or not but I really didn‚Äôt like the smell. It could just be me. Smelt masculine and sporty but a little flowery underneath. Not strong but just enough to annoy me. The cologne smells pretty good but I had a problem with leaky bottle and jelling of the spray nozzle at first and now the pump mechanism has broken :( they need to invest in a little better bottles. My bottle is still fairly full and I can‚Äôt really use it anymore. The size of the bottle is too small. I enjoy the scent, as far as it attracting more attention from women goes, I seem to get hit on a lot more lately. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the cologne or I‚Äôm just more aware of flirtatious acts when I am wearing it. In any case, I‚Äôm going to keep using it. I will report back when I have a definitive answer. The scent was amazing but the staying power was disappointing Smells nice? I like that it isnt overpowering. My interactions with people are much more positive. Nice smell, seems effective, but way too small for the price! This product has a fresh soap like aroma. It lasts all day. It's a great scent and a great value. So far, i have not had large groups of women try to make out with me, but i still like to smell good. Just got it yesterday,  so far so good I did not expect tht this cologne would smell so good! My friends (girls) asks what I‚Äôm wearing as they haven‚Äôt smelled this before.It last long enough and you have to apply two sprays unlike perfumes, just a tiny drop is fine. Overall I am satisfied This is a quality product Worthless and no scent Fragrance is good FOR EVERYDAY USE It smells good to me. Especially, when you don't take shower for weeks. Lol I love the smell, but it seems like it fades pretty fast throughout the day. I'd say it's longevity is about 3 hours, which is good for dates, bad for full days. Crisp scent sort of reminds me of English Leather Lime (1970's) but a little bolder with a hint of something else mixed in.  Everyone (male & female) comments on how ""nice"" I smell.  You can't go wrong with it - not too overpowering, and it mixes well with Talcum powder. Only drawback is that it lasts for evey bit of 30 seconds. Smells good. Works well. Its okay . Not the best Human pheromones have not been proven to exist. I saw this on a tiktok and impulse bought it! Smells good but doesn‚Äôt last very long. The product smell nice, but it only last 5 minutes! They were super nice and sent me a small bottle of oil also for no charge. I think this product is very expensive for a perfum that does not last for more than 5 minutes. I gave it two stars because the seller is nice to deal with. Smells pretty good, but wears off fairly quickly. I think it's more of a Musky cologne than anything. I do notice a slight oil within the spray. I honestly don't see myself purchasing it again, but I could see how some other people could like it and continue to buy it. I bought it to see if it would work. Nada. It‚Äôs cheap and water down. The scent does not last. Great scent and it last quite a long time! Was t as expected. I like the scent, however seems short lived"
68,Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo RGB Backlit Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys Wrist Rest and Red Backlit Gaming Mouse 3200 DPI for Windows PC Gamers (Black),Computers,"Price point was perfect and works great!  Use it primarily for graphics. Like most reviews, the biggest problem is the enter key in the middle since it just doesn't work! The keyboard is great, nice, and smooth clicking sound. Great LED lights however it's not very that customizable but I'm not one for LED lights but they are there if you need them. The mouse is quite small for my hands but it has a great grip, a weight editor where you can change how heavy you want your mouse to be with some extra buttons which can help you (I keep pressing the two buttons on the side but I have big hands so that is understandable if you have big hands be careful). In all, if you don't care about the enter key in the middle then you might like this keyboard however, if you like using the enter key in the middle then you might want to look for something else cause you will be very annoyed (I know this cause I'm very annoyed at it but I'm starting to get used to pressing enter on the number pad).Update (8/2/2021):I have changed this from a 4 star to a 2 star because I started to find more problems with the keyboard. As I started to do assignments for my English class for typing huge amount of words for my paper. A lot of the Shift+(letter) doesn't work. For example LeftShift+U dose not work but the RightShift works. I had this problem with H, J, F, R, O for Leftshift and M, A, E for Right Shift. I'm pretty sure there is going to be more in the future but at point I just wouldn't recommend this keyboard, the mouse of AMAZING but the keyboard is just annoying. For gamers out there who uses WASD you find it very hard to switch keys as it can get stuck, for example if your moving forward with W and you switch to A to move left you will not move as you switch keys too fast as you must have a real like delay which is 100% a no for gamers. the keyboard when it wants to work, the primary enter key does not work. the color change effect keeps resetting. the USB connectors are large enough to make using other USB ports difficult. the worst keyboard I've ever bought. the mouse works fine. Most of the functions did not work, unusable This is the best gaming keyboard and mouse Some lags, inaccuracy....  Possibly some minor errors in hardware Sadly the mouse and keyboard both lose the rLast place they were once shut down.You have to reset the mouse speed every start up unlike any other brand I have used.The keyboard rbg settings always get reset for some odd reason. We have had this thing for quite a while now and it still works like it did new out of the box. B button gave out after a month. Pretty flimsy plastic. It had a lot of potential especially with the number pad. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Pretty Obvious this was a returned item.  Box was damaged.  It a Christmas gift so I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it or return it for another one. The lack of dedicated volume keys is a bit of a let down for me, but otherwise this is a pretty nice keyboard. Other reviews have noted the lack of flow to the colors, and this is true, but it still looks fairly nice. This product came in 4 days earlier which I found to be very convenient and very very nice of Amazon. I expected the package today at 8pm and when I woke up this morning I had a notification saying it was delivered. Very fast and clean work. I bought this set as a replacement to my Microsoft wireless set I had for over a decade. I have had one issue with the keyboard- sometimes fouls the keystroke with a backslash, may just be my unit. I have not seen anyone else having this issue but is not worth my time to return. I am very happy with the mouse, Love the extra buttons and onboard speed settings are awesome! The Board does have color changing LED's with many configurations. I don't think anyone will have trouble finding a color or setting they like. This without doubt is a cheap price.  It is a little disappointing that it is simply impossible to get the software to recognize and customize the mouse as advertised on current version of Windows 10.  First of all the site that is referenced on the box redragonusa.com to get the software doesn't even function.  I am fairly confident the other redragon websites that you find on a Google searches are for other countries causing the mouse customization app to not detect the mouse is connected.  Spent hours trying to get it to work to no avail.  I really like the keyboard, the only downside is the leds are a little dim.  The mouse would likely have been satisfactory as well.  However, without the ability to install the software and customize the mouse buttons, it is just junk.  In addition to not being able to program the buttons, the pulsing light function on the mouse is just annoying.  I ended up tossing the mouse. When the product came, the keyboard had several keys that didn't work correctly. It was the left ""shift"" and ""enter"" keys not working specifically that make this keyboard unusable for my needs. The mouse appeared to be working fine, but the driver download wouldn't install correctly because it was missing a file in the download package on the support website for Red Dragon.Product returned. This is a really nice keyboard. If you have roommates or need a quiet keyboard, this is perfect! I don't really like the mouse, it doesn't match the keyboard unless you set it as only red. But it works, so I'm not complaining. The light is also not the most vibrant, it's pretty but it could be brighter Feature set is good but the quality is iffy.  It feels like cheap plastic and probably wont last as long as my previous keyboard. The key board was fine but the mouse stopped working after a couple of days. Used a different mouse and that worked. So the mouse it came with was the issue. Sending it back keyboard junk, spring in keyswitch not strong, bounce the keyboard and get an output. or spurious keystrokes occurring without human input. it will type stuff by itself. Great for a ps4 and for the price its worth it  100% I very much like the keyboard except with no software there is no way to keep the backlight color once you have selected it.  The mouse needs software to do anything with the buttons.  The instructions say to download it and install BUT go to the website to download and they DO NOT have it listed.  I went to customer support and left a message a couple of days ago and have yet to here back from them.  I am keeping them but would NEVER buy another product from them.  It is your money and spend it where you get support.  Amazon will take it back but i just want it fixed. The mouse and keyboard are a decent combo - minus the fact that the mouse broke in under a week. I can't even return it because I'd have to return the keyboard too. Of course now I don't imagine the keyboard will last much longer, either. You get what you pay for, cheap junk looks good but can break fast. Great buy for the money. The lighting is awesome. My boys love them. 8 months after buying and the mouse stopped working. The keyboard so far has been pretty nice and my son likes it. Disappointed that the mouse didn‚Äôt even last a year. Connected both mouse and keyboard to pc while powered down. Turned system on and mouse worked great. The keyboard in the other hand is a definite no go. Although the keyboard does actually work,  after i locked system and came back 10 minutes later my screen was active and system kept flashing ‚Äúincorrect password try again‚Äù. I immediately restarted it and the same thing happened. I unplugged keyboard while powered up and the attack stopped.I attached old keyboard system is back to normal.I would say definitely some sort of malware built in to keyboard. Sending to a friend for analysis.DO NOT BUY!!!! We have enjoyed this purchase and have actually given them as gifts to my sons gaming friends for their birthdays! It‚Äôs always a huge hit! This friggin keyboard started going crazy...It just crapped out ..which now I cannot return ...so buyers beware.. Its a good keyboard for the price. I only with the warranty card would have come with it. The keys on the keyboard are or feel empty with no firmness. Does as advertised. Feels very cheap. Expected more but I liked the mouse more than the keyboard. Just a couple of month with it, and some letters stop working. I tried reinstall the driver but its impossible to find the driver of this keyboard online. Now I need to buy another keyboard... Very bad experience, you will have a keyboard just for a couple of months. I bought this for the keyboard and it looks really good and feels pretty solid. But, it start auto scrolling web pages and documents, and buttons stop working. The first time the enter key stopped working I was able to unplug it and plug it back in, and it started working again. The next time that didn't work, so I left it unplugged and hooked my old keyboard back up. Just got it in the mail today. The mouse came misaligned and the left and right mouse buttons don‚Äôt work. The keyboard is awesome but the mouse was a disappointment Works pretty nicely. The book it came with says there's supposed to be software I can download but I couldn't find any for this specific set. I've contacted redragon myself about this issue. The colors look really good and it's fairly quiet Dont get your hopes high, you get what you pay, cheap materials mouse and keyboard that works... I saw this keyboard on TV in a show about 911 operators and it works great. I am now a gamer but like subtle light in a room The mouse often just moves by itself. the keyboard died a month and a half after using it. The keys squeaked all the time then one day stopped functioning. The mouse is an ok gaming mouse for non FPS games for FPS games i find it lacking i will not buy again and do not recommend this product ordered this on September 12, 2020. decent setup but now my mouse wheel is starting to go. I have to spin it faster and takes a few ""clicks"" to engage if you know what im trying to say. They board and mouse are good for the money, I mean you get what you pay for the keys are kinda mushy and small and the mouse feels a little light. I am disappointed that this keyboard does not have downloadable software, and it does not maintain the light settings. You have to reset the lights after every restart. It has a nice feel, and if these 2 things were fixed, this would be an awesome keyboard/mouse combo. Love love love...Will be looking for the wireless version Grandson happy with purchase! Love it for the price. Key travel is excellent. The only two minor complaints I have are: 1) the mouse can't change color and kind of pulses red and 2) there are volume keys but they are built into the f-keys so they aren't a one-key press. You have to hold function down while hitting F2-F3-F4 depending on what you want to do. My old keyboard had dedicated keys for this and it was nice.Overall, great value for the money. We ended up with two (birthday present mix-up) and my son ending up keeping the second one since he liked it as well. Very cool lighting, easy to control. Would NOT recommend getting this. The colors are cool when plugged in. However, would need all the keys to function in order to use. Quite a few buttons on the keyboard itself do not work. Looking into getting a refund. Size of keyboard could of been a bit bigger for an ""ergonomic sized"" keyboard.  Otherwise all else is awesome, love the mouse and the colors on it.  The cable is that nice braided looking cable that stands up to wear and tear.  Keyboard has nice bright backlit keys, so you can use the keyboard just fine without the lights on or in low light conditions (like your game cave thats only light with soft lighting like TV or a Fish tank). Bought this keyboard for my teenage son who wanted a ""gaming"" keyboard.  It did the job but now some keys are messed up.  So it lasted about a year.  I guess the fact that it lasted that long could be a testament to the durability, but I was just never impressed with the keyboard (although I was not the primary user).Lights were good though, so if you need to see the keys in a darkened room it's a good choice.  I really want to say something good about this keyboard, but I was just never impressed with it.Not sure what happened to the mouse. Son was excited as he requested this This a wonderful keyboard and mouse combo! I bought on black friday and have been happy ever since. The keyboard has very quiet keys, an easy to use light-changing system (""FN"" key and either ""insert"", ""Home"", or ""Page Up"") and it feels good too. The mouse has a good tack feel to it and it is a joy to use, although it doesn't have the weight of a typical gaming mouse. My only disappointment came from the lack of color-changing options on the mouse, unless I am bad at looking. Red is just not the color theme I chose, but it is great for fans of red. I recommend! I wanted a colorful Keyboard. Its colorful but not as bright as I thought it would be. Overall its good. The mouse that comes with this set is very colorful and works well. *Letters on keyboard wear out really fast (within a couple of months).*Does not have any memory to hold color settings and by default you get an annoying flashing rainbow.*Company does not respond to warranty requests on their website. It's been about 4 months and still have not heard back from them. I bought this for my son. He loves it! But the lights are not brought and are way too dark. The keyboard and mouse look great! Although, I may have received a dud. The spacebar on the keyboard is very hard to press and made a ""springy"" noise as if something was loose. Not to mention, the keyboard and mouse were shipped to me in an unpadded Amazon mailing envelope. Without much confidence in the keyboard, I requested a return. its a keyboard  really thought it be wireless the lights starts flashing absurdlety and vioently as soon as you plug it in leaving you need to adjust it in the chaos light is too bright Unfortunately, a few keys are hard to push down. The shift is the hardest to push and make a loud clicking sound when pushed. Besides that I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the lights, even though I thought I would be. Controls for volume required two button push instead of one. It does have a few extra buttons I do like though. If the buttons didn‚Äôt stick I would say this was a good keyboard and mouse set. When I got it, it didn‚Äôt work and I wasn‚Äôt able to get a return on it when i plugged it into my ps4 i couldn‚Äôt use my mouse at all even with a mouse pad it was uncontrollable i don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs doing that. ive had it for 2 months. give or take. I use this as a personal keyboard and dont play games often. mouse seems ok and the keyboard is pretty quiet. its cheap but.. i guess the rule is golden: you get what you pay for. Keyboard was great, lighting, colors etc.  However quit working after five months .  Went to red dragon and sent 3 emails, to their customer service, explaining problem and if they could help.  Never received anything back from them. Customer service is very important to me and I will not be purchasing anything more from Red Dragon After one year, the middle mouse button just stopped working. Dont buy this crap. This keyboard/mouse combo is working well.  It's also a quite attractive set.  I recommend. Super Good solid mouse an keyboard Well worth the price This works perfectly on my xbox The keyboard isn‚Äôt the issue, it is the mouse. Bought as a present for Christmas, mouse lasted exactly two months. Was being used for gaming and the left-click quit working. For a product that was designed for gaming, it didn‚Äôt hold up. Great quality love it it was describe Love this keyboard, it has all but replaced my laptop's keyboard. The tactile response from the keys is very satisfying and the backlit keyboard with multiple colors and patterns is awesome. Decent gaming mouse with adjustable weights was included. Better quality product for a decent price. I was super excited to get this keyboard and mouse as I am starting to get into pc gaming however the moment I tried using the keyboard I realized something was up. The mouse itself works just fine and I haven‚Äôt had any problems, however the keyboard has several keys that just don‚Äôt work for some reason. I am extremely disappointed after hearing such good things about Red Dragon products but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll buy from them again. Great for the price, but the mouse speed setting resets everything I plug it in. Keyboard works great. Mouse worked the first day I got it and then went to use it the next day and the mouse wouldn't work. I bought the keyboard 3 months ago and now 3 keys stopped working. I don't play games or nor I have a habit of hitting hard still after a very light use three major keys stopped working.. Nothing to really be over the moon about, I wanted a lighted keyboard for my sim racing so I could see the keys in lower light, and while it could be brighter, it mostly works. My biggest hurdle is coming from a wireless keyboard and mouse to a wired setup is annoying. You only get software for the mouse, and it's glitchy, but I shut the light off on it because the only option is to have it ""breathe"" and it's only 1 color, I'd leave it on if it didn't ""breathe"". Mouse options are good, having a changeable dpi setting is helpful for games. Adjustable weight is a nice option too. Not a pro gamer M&K but it gets the job done for casual play. Keyboard is RGB programmable but mouse is only red. No I love the different settings and colors Don't get me wrong, it looks good, feels good, and the lighting is great. However, the first one I received the mouse didn't work at all. Sent it back for a replacement. At first the replacement seemed to work just fine, but I'd been having issues with keys I didn't hit putting out input. I thought maybe I was hitting them by accident, but no. Turns out some of my keys are activated by light vibrations made while using the keyboard, bumping the desk lightly, or (because I live in Alaska) earthquakes. Makes trying to write an essay pretty annoying when every other word your keyboard decides that it's time to start a new paragraph.Update: The seller did contact me and replace the replacement. This time it works as intended. I won't raise my product review from two stars because of the prior issues, but the seller gets five stars for excellent customer service. The keyboard will take up half your desk it sucks and the mouse only goes to 6000 dpi My mouse broke after a 2 months and I contacted the seller and they didn‚Äôt nothing about it. They didn‚Äôt bother to respond. The keyboard is still fine but the mouse doesn‚Äôt work. They have terrible customer service. Don‚Äôt recommend this product. that the light patterns didn't reset after the computer is turned off."
69,"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A 8.0-inch Android Tablet 64GB Wi-Fi Lightweight Large Screen Feel Camera Long-Lasting Battery, Black",Computers,"Didn't know it was a kids addition...but i.like it it serves it's purpose. Overall , it‚Äôs very good.  It does take a long time to wake up.  You have double tap the screen twice because it does not light up right away from sleep mode. Bought it for my mother and she loves it.  She plays her bingo and pay her bills with it. I bought this to replace an old freebie tablet that I received from AT&T, and I wish that I had just purchased something different. This tablet freezes up, even when other devices running on the same wi-fi network are not having problems....it's just frustrating, as I had hoped that I would like this tablet better than I actually do Does its job well for mid range tablet. Slightly heavier but well built What should have been a lovely tablet was seriously misrepresented in Samsung's advertising.  After an online chat with Samsung's customer service, I learned that you cannot move  apps to an SD card on this tablet.  This tablet is heavily marketed to children, and in my experience, children download new games every day.  The internal storage is nowhere near 32 GB, due to Samsung's bloatware.  Shame on you, Samsung!  My cheap prepaid  LG phone can put apps on the SD card, and therefore is more useful.  I won't buy another Samsung product. Size is much smaller than I expected, but I didn't read the description either. Its a good size for my 4 year old, and in combination with Google Family Link, I'm happy! This tablet is in Spanish only and no one can assist me with it. Everything with the exception of the picture taking capabilities. Otherwise terrible. It was a mistake to buy this. I bought this to use in my kitchen for recipes and whatnot but I see now that was a mistake. The pixel or picture quality is horrible. Forget about zooming into any text. It just gets blurry as you make it bigger. This is also very very slow. It takes forever to start up and lags when watching videos. I will be returning.  Do not buy. Bought this to use with my exercise bike and it serves the purpose well with a bluetooth connection for extra apps and functionality. Only thing I'd like better is if it had an ir function to use general remote control apps like my old Tab 4, but at this price the lack is understandable. The touch screen does get a bit unresponsive if your finger is sweaty, but not unusably so. The screen is actually very good. Sound is adequate, but not room filling or really loud by any means. I bought this to replace a 5 year old Galaxy Tab3 8"".  I primarily my tablet to stream video (Netflix, Amazon, Google Play, Crunchyroll), or to play downloaded video while traveling.  I expected this to be an upgrade.  But despite having more memory and faster processor than the Tab3, this tablet is somehow worse.The Bad:1. It will choke on a lot of websites and video streaming apps.  This one is very frustrating.  I'm really not asking much of it here.  I would have thought that a quad core processor would perform better than the 5 year old duo-core in the Tab3.2. The volume button is right next to the power button. So you have to feel about to ensure you are not going to turn it off when you just meant to adjust the volume.3. Having no physical navigation buttons is surprisingly frustrating.  While this doesn't bother me about my phone (an S10) it drives me nuts on this tablet.  When streaming, you now have the press the screen once for the buttons to appear and then you can hit what you want.  I guess this doesn't bother me on the phone because I don't really stream with it, so the nav buttons are always available.The Good:1. The build quality feels real nice and solid.2. The battery is theoretically longer lived than my Tab3, though I have yet to really test that out yet.I would not recommend this tablet.  Look elsewhere. Samsung used to make a quality products but they've taken a step back worth this tablet!  My biggest problem is that the screen is so cheap that the stylus that I use for all my other phones and tablets doesn't work on this one at all!  That means only fingers people! Tried the rubber kind and the felt kind and different brands of stylus but nothing works!It is also very slow for surfing and music services!Please don't think this is a bargain with a good name because it is NOT!  We own multiple Galaxy Phones and Tablets and this is not worth it! Amazon add stated this was a new 2021 device.  It is not.  This is a 2019 device and was not even built to 2018 specs.  Does not have usb-c, not a great processor,  ...  Sure it is cheap, and I wish there were more 7 or 8"" tablets out there, but this just doesn't cut it. Not even as fast as my Galaxy 10. Bought on the Amazon truck and it's going right back. Same as the other reviews. Decent screen but so hard to select. The touchscreen is really not sensitive at all. I have to press really hard to get it to register. But I am only using it for ifit on my treadmill and it is serving its purpose. Didn‚Äôt last a year. Very disappointed. Screen stopped working and it also operated slowly from the get go. Attempted to get warranty support and was told I had to go through a different company than Samsung and may have to pay and then the Samsung representative hung up on me. I had also gone through chat advisor that said I could send it in for service. Bad experience. Good product as Samsung always is Really disappointed in this product. I will not return it, but if I knew that it runs so slowly, I would not have purchased it. I thought being a Samsung product, it would perform better than an off brand. It doesn't A reference guide was listed as being in the package. It was not there. No written instructions, warranty, or anything else on how to use the product, which buttons did what. The sole reason this tablet was purchases was to play Clash Royal, Clash of Clans, and stream Netflix.Three simple tasks this tablet FAILED to complete. Despite updating the software for both the system and all the apps, there was far too much lag that ruined the experience. Since only three apps were installed, storage was not an issue. The issues don't end there, the screen was a bit off, as i was typing for some reason it would detect that i tapped the same letter a few times.I have been been using Samsung products for years, and I'm honestly extremely disappointed. Slow, everything  else is good.Compare with my old tablet Sony  2ram 32rom which I bought 7years ago. definitely this one is slower. But it light weight and good price. If you only want something simple it‚Äôs a good choice. I think it‚Äôs more like a kid‚Äôs table. Not too bad, great tablet for those looking for a cheap tablet for bmw protool, xhp etc. will definitely get the job done, but that‚Äôs about it wouldn‚Äôt buy this for actual tablet use. This is the worst tablet I have ever owned. It freezes all the time, and stays frozen. You have to turn off the tablet to unfreeze it, then you lose whatever it is you've  typed. It's useless to me. I've worked on cheap, no-name brands that have worked better than this. The screen shot feature is so inconvenient; I don't know what they were thinking. The home page starts in the middle. Just ""why""? A reviewer here said it was about bloatware. The charging cord is too short. The clipboard is more  mysterious than it should be. I researched tablets for 2 weeks in tech magazines before I bought this. I have never returned anything to Amazon before so I am really disgusted by the whole experience. I may never buy another Samsung product after this. There are no mid- priced 7 and 8 inch tablets. You either buy junk or shell out a ton of money for something that works. Asus had a great 8 inch tablet but iPad and Samsung hold most of the market now. iPads are just too expensive and this Samsung is just crap.Update: I was trying to send it back and it wouldn't even do a factory reset. I had to spend an hour on the phone with Samsung and she couldn't even get it to reset. Someone else had to join in and it froze 3x trying to just reset it. UPS picked it up today - good riddance to an awful product. I got this on Prime Day so I got this at a good price.  My granddaughter wanted an ipad, but this works just as good and she loves it.  She was happy so I was happy. International model?I found 2 Samsung tab 8 models for sale, one was 160$ and this one was 169$. The 160$ one said it was an international model so I decided to spent 9$ more to get a US or Canadian model.When I received the package, the box was all in Spanish which made me feel stupid for spending 9$ extra for, I'm assuming, the same thing. Anyway 9$ isn't a big deal, just annoyed me.External Storage fail designThe 32GB filled up pretty quick with games and apps so I needed more storage.I had a previous model (not sure which model#) of Samsung and I removed the 128GB samsung EVO select SD from that one to put into this new one. When I go to install a new app it says I have insufficient space. For some reason, samsung doesn't give the option to use the SD as internal or default memory. The same thing for the previous model but there was the option to move applications from the internal storage to the SD card manually. Slightly annoying but it worked. This new samsung model removed that option. The only use for the SD card as per samsung rep. Sharon ""Sorry we donot have option, except to move media files to SD card to free up some space for device.""So it's used for photos, movies and music files basically.Everything else works as expected so far. Extremely dissatisfied with this external memory design decision by Samsung. I had the tablet for a week.  It works very well.  The only thing I encountered is not being able to move apps to SD card, so no conserving space in this way.  But you still can have your camera use SD card and place music on it.  I am enjoying the tablet.  It was reasonable price. I bought this thing for epic seven and it kinda lags with screen animations.Probably does other things great, but that‚Äôs what I bought it for. For watching movies and searching the web this seems to work ok. The camera is not very good as it gives the pictures a noir type lighting.The touchscreen is slow at times which can be frustrating but for watching and searching the web it does the trick.Not my favorite android pad but for the price...not bad. This thing is so annoyingly slow. Plus the sd card capability is virtually worthless at this point since you can't move apps over to the card easily. Oh and micro sd. No rapid charging. I get it's not a 600 dollar tablet but you can get this capability on 150 dollar options.Bottom line,  in this day and age there is no reason for a ~150-200 dollar tablet to be so ungodly unresponsive. Don't waste your money. This tablet is unbelievably slow and unresponsive... not just compared to a higher end tablet, but very disappointingly slow. Certain apps just don't work well either, either crashing or being unresponsive. I guess you can't expect a budget tablet to work even decently. Very disappointed. The tablet is not zippy, looks like the processor is underpowered and ram could be less. Otherwise ok. Screen size smaller than 8"" as advertised Sound suddenly stopped and causing real problems. This tablet is for basic computing needs (that is, surfing the internet, checking e-mails, and watching videos).  The screen quality is mediocre and the touch screen is passable.  You should purchase this tablet if only you are short on cash; if money is no object, it is best to purchase a more substantial tablet. What do I do the screen  cracked inside It was working great handled alot of multi tasking 7 months later it stopped working!I rebooted it it turned on but doesn't work like before.It charges extremely slow and while is charging it stops by itself constantly.The charging port is definitely defective.And tablet freezes easily now. You don't expect a tablet for a hundred bucks to be greased lightning. However, my Galaxy tablet from 2015 leaves this in the dust.This is a nightmare for anyone who has any realistic expectations. It runs like pond water and can't get out of its own way.Don't even waste your time. I returned this in record time. I opened the box and clicked Return within two hours. This did not meet my expectations. I'm coming from a 3 year old Lenovo Tab 4 8.0 and this is no better than that minus the newer Android. They brought back the ambient light sensor for auto brightness but it always defaults to the minimum brightness for some reason when turned on. Comes with Android 9.0 out of the box. It has micro USB in a time where everything is USB C. It plays all my games fine and it plays Netflix and Plex. It also has 32gb internal storage plus micro sd slot. Screen is nice, speakers are also good, gets very loud and have more bass than I thought they would. Has a headphone jack. This is the budget tablet to get I would say, blows away the Kindle fires because it has Play Store.  Needs faster processor, faster storage, and more memory because it is very slow.  Unfortunately there is a huge gap in tablets, you either get a slow budget tablet or you end up having to pay upwards of $400 or more for a fast tablet.  I wish there wasn't such a huge gap.  Hopefully Samsung will take note. Bought to replace out computer, I know, many differences, and we were ok with that. Except that this tablet acts as if its 4 years old already. VERY large and super slow. Sometimes completely unresponsive. More than what should be ok, given this age with technology. Definitely returned will be getting the S6 Lite like my wife has. I loved this, it worked perfectly for a little while. Now after a month it keeps going into the reboot screen. Wish I bought the protection with it. Works great, has a green tint in the screen. Not enough memory for games like fortnite etc. I have had wifi issues almost from the start and had to order a wifi dongle which did work briefly then that too stopped working, so there is something fundamentally wrong with my tablet.  Also when plugging it into the computer via usb there is no option for connecting as a data device ie being able to load files onto the tablet that way. It simply starts to charge and the computer cannot see it; maybe the cable is wrong kind?  no settings anywhere that I can find.  Numerous attempts at restoring factory defaults, etc to no avail.  No solutions found online, this pisses me right off.  I suspect some kind of software or firmware incompatibility that Samsung doesn't bother fixing since it is an older model - something that can't play nice with my new-ish xfinity router.  OR a faulty part. Purchased this device in March on  Monday December 14th the screen went completely black and never came back on. 9 months and there is no reimbursement or compensation for the device very disappointed . The main complaint is that it won't let me get my email as it is on AOL. It tries to force me to use google and microsoft and others for email. So I may have to junk this thing as I wanted it for convenience; not for a pain in the ass. Much smaller screen than a  Galaxy Tab A 8in displayItem model number SM-T350That we received this last May.  Both tablets side by side the new one you get significantly narrower view Liked it fine until I found out you cannot cast to your TV through Roku or screen mirror with this version of Galaxy tab. Who would think that a name brand device would leave that out. I guess they are following Apples lead on this, but with my Iphone I can at least load an app that lets me mirror. After a couple hours wasted and trying apps that ultimately were not compatible I finally found a site that spelled out clearly you cant do that with this tablet. Going backward in technology because I can with my five year old galaxy tab. Go figure. Anyway, just be aware and don't assume as I did only to find out long after the return period expired. I really like this tablet. It's serving It's intended purpose which is to surf the web, check email, watch video's on YouTube, and use some apps. The only downside is that it has a mini USB power connector. It would have been better to have the newer USB C. I always want my electronics to have everything and be instantaneous, but I can't afford the ones that are.Considering what I paid for this it is very nice. It is hard for me to judge battery life, I do tend to get stuck on it playing games for hours, so I do need to plug it in at least once a day."
70,SAMSUNG: EVO Select 128GB MicroSDXC UHS-I U3 100MB/s Full HD & 4K UHD Memory Card with Adapter (MB-ME128HA),Electronics,"I bought for my cell phone. Easy to install. Plenty of storage. Good product. Works exactly as advertised. Only thing I noticed is the read speed is slightly slower than other name brands The packaging was very good however, the sd card is not totally empty.  a handheld scanner reads it as full no matter how much it gets formatted. It shows empty in a card reader but has lots of folders already created or built-in. It cannot be used in all gadgets The memory package as received was clearly previously opened. The whole top part of the packaging was cut off, and the rest had been stapled together.The memory card was not readable by the camera. Placing in a reader, Windows was unable to read it or format it.The thing is, I didn't buy a ""used"" memory card, it was supposed to be new. Very unsatifactory. Don't waste your money. I really wished that this SD card was able to transfer data faster. Everything else on this SD card was perfectly fine and the descriptions were pretty accurate. Works in my GoPro Hero 8 I tried to set the time and after I save the current date and time it returns back to 1/1/2014! This is supposedly a 512gb card. After formating it failed on my phone I bought a SD card reader and my pc says it's an 8gb card. You always have to be wary of SD cards since so many are fake but I figured if I bought from actual Amazon LLC I would be safe. Got a replacement for free. If the whole process ends up free and I get a working 512gb (there's was to varify regardless of how fake it is) I'll change my rating. great product for the price Bought this for my dashcam will not format so I tried it on my on my nikon d3500 did not work tried it on my phone did not work last place was my Nintendo switch and nope that also didn't work I inserted the card in my computer to check the storage capacity, because it was not allowing to install anything  in my device. The storage capacity for this card is 1.9 GB.  Fake card. A good value. Fail after 2nd use..lost all my Videos I made (This is junk) buy better Been used this card for a while as memory card of my drone. Every time I remove it from drone and insert it to my PC, the error jumps out and indicates the disk was corrupted, need to re-insert. To make sure it's not the problem from port, I used 3 different ports, all same situation. Take care if you buy it. Memory card was received on time but was not happy with first experience since card didn't work.. It was not recognized by phone or laptop. On notifying the sender in amazon they have sent replacement card which was really quick to arrive and was in working condition. Service was really good. The microSD card works but the adapter fails in some devices.  I thought it was my critter cam failing but it turns out the problem was the adapter they provided.  Other adapters worked. No issues.  Works just like it should.  Very easy to install It didn‚Äôt work with my dash-cam. Only reason for not giving 5 stars:  I bought 2 of these and 1 did not work. But, Amazon made it right very quickly.  5 stars to Amazon for exceptional customer service Fake!  Holds about 8 Gig but you never know when it's full to that point. When it gets to that point, it becomes unreadable.Can't believe Amazon supports this scam. An inexpensive price for an excellent SD card. Broke plug  in To my switch and damaged  the system. :( I bought this memory card because I bought a driving recorder. The price is more expensive and it is not easy to read the card. In short, I am not very satisfied. I bought it and it was too bad for my needs. I liked it so much that I decided to buy this second one , but it's broken well. I'll just note this supplier on my ""never again"" list. The memory has shrunk a lot.  It doesn‚Äôt seem to run as fast as expected Item does not work. It was not being read when I tried to format and even had a professional try and he confirmed it's a bogus card. Very very disappointed. Unfortunately returning is not an option as I shipped it outside of the country. what is there to say.. it works and does the job capturing 4k video with my drone. Working out fine. They are slow to adding items.but works like a champ.. wish the speed was faster otherwise great The card came delivered perfectly. When using the card for the past month, it's a little iffy. I use this card and put it on my house camera and sometimes it's not reading or recording the footage. Doubt it is a camera issue but yeah, sometimes its not storing. Also, sometimes its not capturing footage on my dash cam when I used it for that. Camera just turns off as it is not recording or capturing footage. Well worth the money. Love these cards. I use them in.Gopro plusGopro 5 blackGopro 6 blackGopro 7 black x2Gopro fusionDji osmoDji osmo pocket2Dji mavic proDji mavic mini and mini2Ape man action cameraNikon cameras. And some equipment I know I forgot...lol Never an issue, and they get a workout..trust me. From searing hot climates on lava flows to under ice shelves. Never an issue or corrupt file. Absolutely reliable. Hence why I own over 30 of these now. I got the 1st package with none of card reader or card working, the replacement is fine, overall expeience 3 stars, but consider the price, it stil ok to buy I liked it I am using it to free up some space on my laptop.  I put a couple hundred photos on it so far (which took up minimal space) but it continuously disconnects and reconnects to my laptop when it is in and not being touched.  The sound drives me crazy and it is a hassle when I'm looking for a specific photo and it disconnects. I purposely bought Samsung brand sd card for my Samsung tablet. I just assume it is most appropriate. Cost a little more but I think it is worth it to stick with same brand. I bought this for my wife to expand her Galaxy S10 phone; however, it only has slightly more than 460gb+ of usage storage.  WHAT THE HECK!?!?  I understand some storage is required for formatting, but 50gbs worth!?  That's way too much in my opinion.  Just thought I would give others the heads-up.  Otherwise, the card is good, solid speed, and quality you would expect from Samsung's EVO memory card line of products. I needed an SDHC and this is the largest sized available in that format Lifespan of these are limited when used with raspberry pi used to setup a home assistant install. Ran thru 2 cards in a year. I only got 59G after format oh well good luck good for price Fair enough The storage is not what it says it is. I Thought that it may had just been one that is no good so I purchase 3, one after another. I was quite disappointed each time. Three of them and the storage was 476gb, 477gb, and 477gb storage. Of course I do not expect the full 512gb, but over 35gb missing is just too much. Not what I expected as cant get it to transfer my pictures or any documents,  it did say it is for my phone, but wish could transfer my things to it. ‚òπ I bought this SD card 3 months ago and it is terrible!! I bought the 32 Gb and the 128 GB from the same page the were clearly not the same the 32 Gb card was rather speedy i got over 101 mb/s but the 128 Gb was terrible!! First when I bought it the package was already torn open and I plugged it in to my MacBook and it had 3 partitions of course none of them would work on macOS üôÑ so I reformatted it to apfs and it was super slow, I figured it probably wasn‚Äôt made for apfs so I tried hfs+ still super slow, I finally formatted it to fat32 and it would barely get above 20 mb/s I was very disappointed cause I could not use it for my video camera that requires a minimum of 85mb/s. Would not buy again!!! It does not work on my PC well. I can not store and transfer my file to this item. If possible, I would like to return it soon. I used this card in Canon 70D with the adapter comes with the card. After I copied photos to computer, I found I can't delete them from the card. Checked the switch on the adapter and it's not locked. Took the card out then used with a USB reader, still the same. I also tried to put it into my old Samsung Note 2, the phone can't format it either. Wasted my time. Bought for my GPS several sets, supposed to be high quality but,,,not even a month installed and now my camera can't see the cards, removed and repeatedly replaced with no changes, these card's I believe are not Samsung, I believe these are fake Returning, This was recommened by a YouTuber and it works fine. Last time I checked it had about 180 files 3 minutes or less. That so far is about 36 minutes a day for 10 days of driving. I bought this for a mirror cam that accepts up to 128 GB SD card. You can research more infomation online to decide if you need a 128 GB SD card. Get the highest number you can so it don't have to rewrite over old file as often. This should make it last longer. cant believe these went from a U3 to a U1 at amazon and the quality and speed has really dropped, avoid go with PNY same price and are U3, work great in all my whoops and drones. I experience some files or folders lost -> please go for SanDisk brand I‚Äôm enjoying the added space on my Nintendo Switch with this product makes having an extensive library of games more manageable file transfer speeds are really good also. Good product and will be buying more I got this memory card for a dashcam that required a high read/write speed and it works well for that. It was easy to set up and format the card for use, and the included adapter makes plugging it into my laptop easy.It is a little more expensive than other brands with a similar storage capacity though. Nice product but it does not support 4k at 60fps. Find a different one. Bought this to go into my phone for additional storage. I've bought some 'junk' brands in the past, but felt rest assured I'd be happy with Samsung brand, and I was. Works perfect. Purchased because I read professional reviews about its reliability since I'm using them in 4K UHD dash camsVery very surprised, when formatted exFAT, this 128GB card only has 119.34GB free spaceRead 100MBs, write about 60MBs, so it's lower than SanDisk Extreme I usually purchase which are rated 160 read/90 write.  (I trust read/write outcomes from consumer reviews, not manufacture packagingThe lower price should not be a reason to purchase this cardAfter reformatting, doubt I'll purchase other sizes in this line of cardsUpdate 10/16/2020Just received the 128GB SanDisk Extreme, formatted exFAT at same level of 119.35GB free space, so it must be the norm for this capacity card. Just like others have commented, the 128gb version of this product reads/writes at 60gbs a second. I transferred data from my PNY 64gb micro to transfer onto the 128 Samsung. The PNY 64 downloaded the files at an average speed of 88mb a second. The average upload speed onto the Samsung was 55mb a second. Will not work in go pro hero 9. Picture freezes in 4K and 5k modes good and affordable but doesnt really have 128gb of storage. had about 108gb only 59 gb instead of 64 Added needed storage to my Lenovo Miix. Recommend for small windows laptops, tablets. Inexpensive way to add storage. So far it's serving its purpose. I haven't stored or loaded a lot of app on my tablet yet. I bought this to backup my hard drive too. It functions nicely, and is much faster than my usb drive One micro sd micro failure in 2 days QC needs a lot of work. I have two of theses cards (purchased at different times). One works fine on my tablet, the other keeps making my tablet issue a warning that the card was removed unsafely (and to reboot to fix the issue). Of course that's only a temporary fix and then it happens again. Put in our security camera & now we are able to use camera for it's intended uses! Very happy!! Card stopped reading on my system.  I tried it in several other devices and computers. None of them would recognize the card.  I tried to register it on the samsung warranty site, but it says model and serial not found.  Looks like it could be a fake card.  Not happy considering it was sold by Samsung This is NOT 32GB this is 28. Don't buy unless you don't really care. This is deceitful and should not be advertised as 32. Buy it pop it into your device and you'll see exactly what I mean. I got a 64 instead of the 128 don't want to take time to return just putting it out there just in case someone else had the same problem Sd card stopped working, lost 64 gb of pictures. Didn't send it back because I was trying to get it fixed. Junk card. How is this allowed for products listed as 512 gb storage card to only have 476 gb actual usable storage?The listing (item sold by amzn) have no mention whatsoever on the ACTUAL storage. this is where i have a problem. I feel mislead"
71,Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub with Individual LED lit Power Switches (HB-UMLS),Computers,"This was a waste of money for me. I travel in a van full time and have limited USB ports and bought this hoping to be able to charge multiple small electronics at the same time. Doesn‚Äôt work with my iPhone 11 or my Apple Watch, two of the most used pieces I have. So, skip this if you‚Äôre planning to charge any type of Apple product. üòï I bought this device since during the pandemic I am working from home and my monitor does not have USB slots to use and a laptop has only two. I use one for the wireless keyboard and a mouse and this device helps me to connect a camera, a wireless charger for a phone, and a stick. One slot sometimes remains spare. Very useful device. used to have more available connections and was advised to use with Silhouette for better connection. This has helped As the headline said, it feels a bit like a cheap plastic and weighs less than nothing, but it works, and it seems to hold up, even used as a hub for a phone, a MIDI piano, and an eLicenser unit, and that's quite a lot of bandwidth. The cable is a bit short, but for most applications, it will be plenty long. So far so good. It arrived very promptly. Seems to be working perfectly. I like that it has on/off switches for each port. Stopped working after a few months. Any device I plug in either does not charge or throws a message that the charging device is a slow charge Works good didn't have no problems,had two different lights on ,charging phone and using tablet with this 4 -port USB The USB charger idea is a great concept, but there was not enough power to charge my iPhone X even when it was the only thing plugged into the USB charger. There are four ports, and I was able to charge multiple items at once (Sony and Beats headphones), but my iPhone would not charge. works This is the first usb extension I have ever purchased that actually works. Having the ability to turn off and on hard drives or chargers without unplugging them is great! it works I use this on my work laptop to connect a couple more USB devices - mouse, keyboard, etc..  I have not used this for video, and this works great for what I need it for. Android wont charge with this inline. Just What I Needed.  About To Buy Another One For My Other Laptop. This item was not up to my expectations and it wasn't what I expected it was way small and the cord was a little short but okay and the packaging was done very well Plus what you get it may be a little overpriced this should go for $5 exactly on the DOT if this was a $5 product it would have been perfect Would charge more than one item plugged in Have a few of them work very welll It worked well for the first couple months but after that it constantly is acting like the drives keep getting disconnected and connected so when you have a drive plugged in and are trying to do something or save files it screws up like you unplugged it even though the light is still on and clearly connected. These things DO NOT WORK. I ordered the first one and it didn‚Äôt work soo they sent me another one. It still don‚Äôt work It may have four ports but they are so close together I can only fit two thumb drives at a time. It works as expected, but the bright LED lights for each port are really annoying, especially if you keep this in a bedroom at night. Brought this Aug 19 2020. It worked fine. Now today April 23 2021. It stopped working. In the middle of my workday. I need it to work & I'm stuck. It didn't last a year. Won't ship with this vender again. My employer recently swapped out my Windows 7-based VPN laptop, which was an HP ProBook with a newer HP EliteBook with iGel on it.  The ProBook had four total USB ports, two on each side.  I used three of them:  one for a Yubi key, and two on the right side for a KVM hookup for mouse and keyboard.The EliteBook only has TWO USB ports, one on each side + a USB-C which is useless to me.  I had no good way to use my KVM cables anymore, so I tried this hub from Sabrent.  WORKS GREAT!  I have a two-port KVM hooked to it, which runs my Microsoft Ergonomic Natural 4000 keyboard as well as a Logitech G502 mouse.It is a bit more desktop clutter now, but I can deal with that in favor of being able to use my original peripherals for long VPN sessions for work.  The hub DOES NOT get warm, and that's after two hours of use.  The light glow for each port is very unobtrusive and doesn't bother me.Only thing which I do a bit different is I often times will put the laptop into Sleep mode (it has a write-protected drive for security purposes) so my wifi and display settings don't get erased.  The USB hub stays powered, so to prevent it from draining the laptop battery in sleep mode I just press the two buttons to turn off those ports and I've had no issues so far with coming back to a dead battery. A nice little gadget to extend the power of your plug-ins! very slow charge on Samsung Android phone.... compared to direct to Belkin power strip Works as it should I was concerned if more than 1 Inputs could be operated  (hot, or on) at the same time.  They can be, no need to turn just one input on at a time, though this unit does allow for that should you elect to do so.I used this to add 3 more USB Inputs to a PC unit I had run out of Inputs to, and it works like a champ. And the $price is quite reasonable.  ps:  those blue LED's are kinda neat also.  BUY IT ! meets my expectations Works well for my set up. I have a wired mouse and keyboard along with a USB desk lamp. I live that I can tur them off when I'm done! Only 1 port works, not even worth sending back Disappointed that it can't do fast charging. It is painfully slow. It now lives in a drawer. It worked great for peripherals (mouse, keyboard, small light I use) I only had 2 ports in front of my computer, I really needed 3; so I got this thing.  It worked terrific, and no it didn't get hot as I'd seen others claim (maybe it did for them, but mine stayed cool). I had a minor water splash and I think some of it may have hit the unit, although all night last night it worked fine. This morning -- every port would NOT work.  So before I fully blame the unit, even though I've found quite a few claiming it gave out after a while, I'll give it another try, just to be certain it wasn't my fault.  Stay tuned.. because I *will* follow up when I use the replacement -- which, if it does the same thing-- I'll certainly add to this review. Eh.  It felt cheap and lightweight, but whatever, as long as it works.  Only 3/4 of the ports work on the first one (I ordered 2 - one for home, one for work).  If you hold your mouth right and hold it just so after wiggling. . . It may or may not work.  The saving grace is the light, so at least you know.  I was wanting to leave one at work, as we all share a computer and wouldn't have to unplug each other's chargers: androids, iphone, etc.  It'll still serve the purpose, but my coworkers will not know how to use the one port.  I guess 3 out of 4 ain't bad?  The 2nd one was better. So far, they all work.  Will update if anything changes! One dead port on arrival. Switch still lights it up but no data or power. This was a set of 2 and the other is fine. Don‚Äôt waste your money. Only 2 of the ports work. Too late for me to return/exchange it. Not happy. Didn't work at all and not worth the trouble of driving a half hour to send it back! Really disappointed in this item! I‚Äôve used it twice and one of the buttons doesn‚Äôt click anymore. I have three more left which I hope last longer. It feels fragile at touch. With two USB ports and the need for 5 this solved my issue perfectly and is lightweight, easy to use. I like that I can turn on/ off ports as needed. It charges very, very slowly. I am not pleased at all. I only gave it 2 stars because it does charge it after all, and if you have nothing else, this will work, otherwise, it's a waste of money. Well, it's hard to review.  I plugged it in, and it worked.End of Review. I thought that the price on this was too good to be true and found out why.  Worked for 6 months and now will no longer connect any device to my PC. It works... But dosent, If I try to move the usb splitter it would turn off and turn back on, it gets really annoying because I have an external hard drive hooked up to the usb splitter and my mouse, when ever I see my mouse turn off im like OH BOY, and my external hard drive gets shut down, and I have to reload the game again, this sucks when im playing an online game like cs go or rainbow six I should have read more into the description/functionality of product didn't put out enough power to do what I needed it to do. Hated it. Didn‚Äôt work Does exactly what I wanted If your laptop has limited USB ports, this is a value for money hub.I plugged in a key board, headset and internet port and it worked well! It‚Äôs a lifesaver for when your computer/ laptop or other device only has one USB port, I love that there is light indicators for which ports you are using and you can turn on and off the power for one of the outlets without unplugging the whole thing. Only downside I‚Äôve noticed so far is it disconnects quite often if the cord moves, but that could also be because I bought an opened one. Overall awesome to have When I opened the box and took out the items, I pressed down the buttons to see if they would all turn on. The first button that I pressed broke immediately, and has been stuck down. It would've been fine, since that would mean that it's permanently turned on, but that port no longer works. 3 out of the 4 ports work fine, but the one with the broken button doesn't work at all anymore. Works okay. It works well for peripherals such as a mouse, controller, or keyboard, but I got a terrible hum when I tried to use my headset.  I got a new headset for unrelated reasons, and it still produced the same loud hum.  Overall, I would recommend this, unless you want to use it with a USB headset for gaming or whatnot. I was buy it by mistake, I thought they were 3.0 ports. not bad product anyway the cord is really short but other then that it‚Äôs good Product said 3.0 but shipped 2.0 This product is good to a certain point I had these for awhile at first they worked pretty good but then they make my gaming mouse flicker in and out of connection Will not charge my iPhone, but it will my iWatch and Projector. Leaves a little to be desired and cord could be a bit longer When I first using this product, I thought my phone has a problem, not this product. But it turned out that this product takes way longer time to charge my devices like two or three more times is needed. I did not return it becaus it works although it takes forever to charge my phone. (I actually don't use it now, but I am still keeping it because for trip, its better than nothing I guess and it is really cheap so....) I only needed a hub to simply open a few more ports, the only drawback is that I was hoping to place it on my desk, but the cable is very short and not detachable. I just ended up tacking it on the side of my case though, and shuffling my plugs around.I'm using it only for simple stuff, so don't even need the 2.0 but it's responsive enough to have my mouse, headphones and game controller plugged into it and no issues. The cord was too short for what I needed. But that issue is on me should've double checked. This product worked fine without any issues for about a month or so but recently I came across the problem that it is not recognizable on my computer. It was really convenient that I can turn off individually for each slot. I just wished it didn't stop working all of a sudden. Does not work or connect with MacBook pro. Bad connection.. I have purchased more than ten of these little hubs over the years and loved them. They have been my go to hub for a number of needs. But I just bought a new one and was sorely disappointed when I opened the box. They used to have a high quality cable with a thick, robust housing sleeve...close to  1/4"" thick. This new one is barely an 1/8"" and very flimsy. I don't think it will last long at all. I don't think it is durable enough for travel purposes. So sad to see another company ruin a perfectly good product to save a few pennies. I would have rather paid the difference to get a quality product. Now I will have to find another go-to USB hub. It's good for....well almost nothing, if all you're doing is transferring a low bit files off of 1-2 drives then you shouldn't have a problem, but don't expect to thread your accesories through this thing and have the same quality of a direct connection. works like charm This buttons are uneven and feels cheap. Hard to put usb in and scratches them when I take it out. Yeah Arrived with one of the buttons defective/broken. It wasn't an issue with shipping, it was packaged ver securely. It's a cool concept, but it is just too crummy/low quality to justify buying it. I used the product to charge headphones, AA battery and Apple Watch. I guess it knew that I didn‚Äôt need the fourth port because it was not working when I got it. This works ok but it will not charge your phone anywhere near the speed that it would be in the regular usb socket.  I do find it beneficial when travelling, but you need to be careful as is not too sturdy. I bought this for a specific reason and it's inconvenient when only works at 75%. Should have spent extra money. You get what you pay for. What I really like about this hub is that there are buttons to turn on or off the various items plugged in.  This is great for computer telephone headsets so that you can turn it off when not in use and still hear the sounds/alerts through the computer. For example, we use a computer phone system at work.  When I'm done with a phone call, I switch off the USB hub for the headset so that I can hear the other notifications (for new emails, Zoom calls, etc.) without having to leave my headset on the whole day.  So far so good! So far so good.  Like the ability to turn off ports when not needed.  On a desktop that doesn't matter but using a laptop it would drain power having them all powered up. If your Desktop's USB Port(s) are in the front and on the upper part of the Tower... these will ""dangle"" in mid-air and are (1) look extremely messy and disorganized (unless you like having a bunch of black spaghetti hanging in front of your tower; and (2) a real pain in the @$$ to connect anything to them.  I guess they're good for a Laptop and that's about it. This product was intact when it reached me. Working well so far Worked great.  Fast delivery.  Easy to use. Happy with my purchase 3PORTS no waiting. one quit and stuck off. I used this to add more usb ports to my laptop since mine don't work anymore. This was a good solution.I was able to multitask and switch on and off devices with this item.My only complaint is I wish the cord was longer This is exactly what we needed and it works GREAT !!! Needed some more port for a new laptop. Really like this one because you can switch on/off each port on the hub, instead of turning the whole thing off. Works great so far. Fried my usb port. Smelled like burnt wires Nice product that does exactly what it's supposed to. Works great for my laptop! But these ports cannot be used for charging anything. It didn‚Äôt charge my iPhone,returned I've used this usb with my macbook pro and it is starting to go. If you move it slightly the usb devices disconnect. I've tested each usb device with the connection on the laptop and there are no issues. This does not work with a mouse usb or a number pad usb. I needed this for both because my laptop only has one usb port. AND after having tried putting my mouse usb into this port, not my mouse won't work at all back in the original laptop usb port. I am so angry!!! charges things super slow Added to docking station to plug in USB lights. Works great. Got this for work at home and it‚Äôs awesome. So easy to use and affordable. Will buy from buyer again Win10 doesn't acknowledge anything you plug into this USB. It will charge but it will not acknowledge when something is plugged in. It worked fine before I had to get a new laptop. They claim there is no drivers on these so I am at a loss. My drivers and settings are all uptodate on my laptop. Individual on off buttons are great..cord length could be better ..needs to be longer..over all I'd  give it a 4 star rating The product is sleek and probably works fine for most things, but I purchased this product to plug into my tv to power a light strip and my Roku stick. When I have both on, the hub does not have the ability to power both and the Roku turns off. Will be returning in hopes I can find one with a higher voltage capacity, but otherwise, the product works fine with only one thing plugged into it. Small but what I needed for laptop The cord is short but just the right length to set next on the table next to my computer.  I ordered two.  One came damaged (very scratched) but appears to work.  Not the highest quality but will work  for my needs. When I first got it, it worked okay until it started disconnecting and reconnecting repeatedly, causing my computer to ping nonstop. I figured that I could glue it down so that it wouldn't move and disconnect. This worked for a little bit, but now it's back to disconnecting. Otherwise, it looks nice and functions well when it does function. Works perfect so far, not cheaply made as others"
72,SafeRest Queen Size Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector - Vinyl Free,Home and Kitchen,"Good investment for your mattress Cheap thin fabric,  disappointing. Won‚Äôt stay on the mattress, weak elastic.Feels like a cross between thick sheet and incredibly cheap towel material‚Ä¶. I feel duped! I need to store a queen mattress in an exterior storage shed. This will keep it clean and dry in storage. Very happy I purchased my SafeRest mattress protector. Five day after setting up my bed and mattress with my SafeRest, my daughters Rottweiler decided to mark my new mattress, thank God it had the SafeRest it prevented damage to the mattress. Highly recommended it especially if you have a memory foam mattress. We purchased four of these to go on the beds in our Airbnb about 6 months ago.  Since then we've had about 10 families with kids.  Travel is stressful on little ones, and accidents seem to be a frequent occurrence with our guests.  So far these have kept our mattresses dry and like new.  They fit well, come off easily and wash and dry just like a regular sheet.  We tried a few other brands from other stores, but they're loud and don't seem like they'd breathe well  Based on our use, I'd highly recommend this product. Happy customer My king size bed is 12‚Äù and this was a good fit it even has xtra room if bed is a little bigger Just got it so I can provide reviews on water resister or other After reading ALL the reviews i hesitantly purchased this mattress cover.I am currently potty training my daughter and make sure she uses the bathroom numerous times before bed to ensure an empty bladder along with cutting out liquids 3hours before bed, but the first night we put this on her bed, she peed right through to her mattress.I can‚Äôt be too upset because I read all the reviews that said this isn‚Äôt truly waterproof but I was hoping the company would read the comments and make their product better, especially with a better waterproofing system, seeing as it claims to be 100% waterproof.So, buyer beware! This is definitely not water proof and your child will pee through no matter how much or how little their bladder has in it. I found it very uncomfortable, scratchy and bunches easily under the sheet. I‚Äôm returning it. This product provided zero protection for my mattress.  Fluids run right through the protector. This mattress topper is soft. It is also easy to put on bed and easy to wash. I personally believe this topper is contributing to my partner and I sweats... We have been sweating really bad lately. Also this mattress protector is supposed to be water resistant but when my toddler spills a little bit of milk in our bed the mattress gets wet. Thankfully my toddlers mattress is water resistant so we just wipe it off when any spills or messes occur. This protector NOT being water resistant is a huge let down. We wash our linens twice a week. This mattress protector is prefectly waterproof.  There have been two ostomy pouch-related episodes, since I bought this protector, and it worked perfectly in preventing liquid from reaching the mattress.  However, it fails miserably when it comes to stain resistance and washing.  After pre-soaking, pre-treating and waahing on the Extended Wash Cycle, the protector is still so badly stained that I had to throw it out, today.  The old Utopia protector, which I bought two years ago, and just replaced with this one,, always came out of the wash, just as clean as the day I got it.  I am going back to Uptopia and will not be buying SafeRest again. Don‚Äôt buy this. Doesn‚Äôt work. Went straight thru the mattress. My toddler had an overnight accident and the mattress is soaked. I don't understand how you can call this thing waterproof when it OBVIOUSLY is not. DO NOT BUY if getting for accidents Unable to answer. Wont open until mid-April My low score is due to the fact that this mattress cover hold on to body heat which makes sleeping impossible for us. Seriously, I get butt cheek sweat now because of this mattress pad. It is heat retaining. Sleep naked. Here is why:Super water resistant, the puppy peed on it, I butt sweat on it, and boom mattress dry at eff.The puppy will someday be potty trained, until then yes, his urine does not penetrate the barrier. #pottytrainingI have washed about a million times, holding strong! I throw it in the washer AND the dryer.#allergies #puppies #hypoallergenicdog #buttsweat #coolproduct #itiscoolto #sleepwithoutpants I was disappointed that this is not a fully enclosed mattress protector with zipper used to reduce allergens. It is a mattress pad with plastic layer, more for protecting mattress from incontinence. Tried to return it but b/c 1 month+1 day from delivery (to a weird place where we didn't find it right away) but amazon won't let me. This is the best water resistant mattress cover I‚Äôve bought so far. Held great when my dog peed on it ü§™ This is a good cover to protect your mattress. Good material. No issues so far. I assumed this zipped around matress completely. It does not. Its more like a fitted sheet. Unfortunately these are more water resistant and not waterproof. Got it because I have a senior dog who occasionally has accidents and I just bought a new mattress. Low and behold she peed the bed after putting this on only a few days prior. I remove it to find the brand new mattress wet underneath. Do not recommend for actual waterproofing. We did not like the terrycloth material on the top of this item. Although the inside liner is waterproof . Quite unbreathable and makes the mattress become extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. Could not use it for longer. I had a SafeRest mattress pad fail & leak thru to the mattress purchased 11/2016.  CJ with their customer service dept provided a warranty replacement without any hassle.  Great customer service is rare these days, & SafeRest is keeping me as a customer for the future! Cannot speak for whether or not these protect from accidents and stains.  This review is about the feel and sound of the item.Bought 3 - opened one and put on the kid's bed.First impression out of the box was ""Eww - this feels awful.  Well, it'll be under a sheet, so let's put it on and see how it goes.""The terry texture was rough and cheap feeling - like a dollar store washcloth, only worse.  The whole thing crinkled out of the package.Put it on the bed - still noisy like a plastic picnic tablecloth.Make the bed and press down with my hand.  The thing makes a rubbery squeak sound.Ok, maybe laying down distributes it more and it's less noticeable.  Nope!  It's crinkly, rubbery, and squeaky.  It's like those 1970's mattress protectors for feel and sound.I guess if that doesn't bother you, it looked to be otherwise highly rated.  I just need to look elsewhere for a product similar to what's on the other kid's bed (and that I now can't find) and have returned these. Great product for someone with allergies! It is NOT waterproof. The mattress gets wet. Ugh!!! have not had it long enough to really check it out. But I do not like the terry cloth side. Leaked through first time on brand new mattress. Very disappointed. Horrible, this product is not waterproof! Bought this as a gift, works great. like it Happy with it Lame For granddaughter new twin bed I am a hot sleeper and this mattress cover is not for me.  It has a terry cloth feel on the top and makes me hotter while sleeping. I've had this on my bed for two years, and it hadn't been completely tested until last night when my elderly dog had an accident. I pulled up the comforter, 2 sheets, and the protective cover only to find a small damp spot on the mattress.I've washed the cover, but never run it through the dryer, so I don't believe it's a breakdown of the material, unless these things have a waterproof ""life expectancy"".It's a decent price, so worth the cost if you're dealing with rare accidents, but I wouldn't trust it for potty training. If there is an accident, remove it immediately! I was disappointed in the protection it offered.  My grandchild had an accident, and it still managed to seep through to the mattress somewhat.gramma One of my dogs is incontinent and this is great for her bedding BUT when washing, it takes forever to dry...about an hour, even by itself! This would be a good mattress protector if you don‚Äôt need to wash it often. Annoying. This item is not made to last.  It was washed by itself on gentle, cold water cycle and allowed to self dry because it seemed flimsy.  Even with that extra care, seams came loose and there were tears in the fabric. Easy to put on, however it consistently curls up in the middle- does not lay flat for long.  You can feel the wrinkles under your sheets. Not very comfortable. I would NOT recommend it. It fit beautifully on a king size bed nice and snug. To protect itself is very thin and flimsy feeling. They hyped this one up a bit, decent sheet for 40/60 dollar range. Loved it when my toddler started potty training and would ahve accidents. Its an easy slip on-off style! I like how it feels too. Perfect mattress protector It‚Äôs not what I thought it would be. It doesn‚Äôt zip up at the bottom and it‚Äôs not stain resistant. Perfect for the mattes Wrinkled on bed badly and not full enough for 14 in mattress Good mattress protector Such a bad quality not worth the price. This item it‚Äôs a big towel used as a matress cover. Will definitely return this item. I bought a new queen mattress online that why I bought this product. I shopped and compared with others mattress protectors on amazon and thought this one should be good with a reasonable price but turns out that doesn't not like what I was thinking.They don't fit well with my mattress, It's a big minus for this product. And It's hard to put the protectors in. We wash it before use and somehow It's not good after washing with warm water. I can feel their quality decrease after washing it. Well made, washes up nicely It's fine for the price. Potty training my toddler over here...Some still did leak a tiny bit through one time, but it‚Äôs just so soft and doesn‚Äôt make a plastic noise, so we prefer it. Very easy to wash. I place a towel under it now just in case. I think my toddler would go crazy with one of the 100% plastic ones with the noise they create. Bought this full size after buying two queens.  Only one instance of spill so far on queen and it held up well. The full size does not completely envelope a 14"" mattress on al edges like the queen does but seems like good protector. We bought this for our son as we have stopped using nighttime pull-ups. It is very effective at protecting the mattress from nighttime accidents. It is soft and you do not know it is there at all. Easy to wash and easy to put on the bed. We are so pleased with it. This product doesn‚Äôt have any friction and slides around on the mattress when moving. Anyone else have this issue? Bought the king sized version of this for a memory foam mattress.  I was told that memory foam beds are much warmer/hotter than traditional mattresses.... they were right.  I was told that this protector adds to the ""hot"" experience...  it did.  I am now looking for a permeable protector...  one that breathes. Overall I really like this sheet. It does the job. My cat is old and has accidents all over so we needed something that would protect our brand new bed. We've had it about 6 months now, it is water resistant... for the most part. I've washed it per the instructions, but maybe over time the protective material deteriorates. I recently spilled coffee on my bed and it soaked through the sheet and stained my mattress. Water and pee have never soaked through though. This protector is as expected & functions well from a liquid protection, easy care, and mattress fit perspective. However, it‚Äôs not breathable at all. If you‚Äôre a hot sleeper, this turns your bed into a sauna. My granddaughter had an accident and wee the bed.  It soaked through to the mattress and the mattress is wet. It's okay, I have been sleeping on it for a while now and that's all I could say. It's not the best but it's not the worst. I don't like the texture on the bed covering. Bought it for allergy protection features. It turned out to be very low quality material for the price. I thought it was a casing but it ended up being just a cover so the allergy protection is not intergral. This is a must have and must use for those of us with toddler age kids. Wash only using delicate cycles of your washing machine and dryer on low heat or you will ruined the waterproofing of this mattress cover. It is waterproof but after one cycle on dryer high heat and it will be no more waterproof than your fabric mattress sheet. Easy to wash Does NOT protect against leaks!!! It is just as absorbent as a towel.  The fabric is nice and it fits well but it does NOT help against water or anything of any kind, just absorbs it or the water beads up and moves to another part or on the floor. I WOULD NOT GET THIS FOR THE WATER REPEL ASPECT. Not a bad product, it is very soft, it just did not stand up to what I was expecting and hoping for. I think the product is probably meant for a larger (heavier) mattress on a firmer bed, but honestly I would not recommend this product.  It doesn't stay under the mattress very well and doesn't fit well on the bed.  Would prefer if the metal bars in the bottom went all the way to the other side, as it seems to fall off a lot as the bed moves. My problem with this is that if your child wets the bed, I doesn‚Äôt prevent the mattress from getting wet. It feels good and is soundless on the bed, but is zero percent waterproof. Also is very hard to wash and dry. Good product, great value. Is a little bit loud when you move. And is hot. Not a lot if air flow. But over all is ok. Seems ok. Not entirely waterproof, but given the price and quality materials, I have been happy with this mattress protector. I‚Äôve even ordered another one for my twin bed. Easy to clean just follow the instructions. Probably one of the best mattress covers out there. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find fully waterproof without the use of toxic materials, and since this product doesn‚Äôt use those, well, it‚Äôs not 100% waterproof. It will give you time to clean the mess before the liquid sinks into the mattress though, so that‚Äôs a plus. I bought this because I have a naughty cat that likes to pee on the bed if she feels her cat litter isnt up to her standard.  Everytime there is an accident it leaks through almost completely, this does nothing at all.  It might be ok just to keep your mattress clean from regular dirt but not from anything wet. Definitely not noiseless or cooling. Definitely will change the feel of your mattress. It is a common terry cloth towel with a waterproof backing. Does not work at all. It‚Äôs a terrible product. Started licking even before the first wash. I ordered it and it lasted for some time. But the second order is awful. The quality is so bad! Too crinkly. Feels cheap I mean it‚Äôs good for its uses but it‚Äôs kinda rough and not that soft Not as expected, just felt like a towel which I didn‚Äôt like. I retired this product. Great when you have small children Exactly as expected! It's water resistant, and best part no noise! I'm used to the crunchy sounding protectors but this one is nothing like those! It's also soft. Wish I could return this but I missed the return window.  Though it's very well-made, I've never used it b/c it's too noisy for me.  The top is made of comfortable terry cloth, but the underside (while not vinyl) made enough noise when I was pulling it out of the package that I knew it wouldn't work for us.  I think it would be fine for a child and for anyone who is a sound sleeper, however, not for those who toss and turn at the slightest noise or disturbance.  If it was quieter, it would have been a keeper! Potty resistant I'm a restless sleeper, and this thing keeps coming off? If this completely sealed I would have given it 5 stars instead I'm searching for a replacement. is not a good quality This is supposed to be water resistant and it‚Äôs not my son split water on my bed and it went threw all the way to my mattress Great fabric and very water resistance!  Great for little ones not quite potty trained! Didn't like this texture, sent back. This is a great product for potty training but it is very uncomfortable This thing doesnt actually cover the whole mattress and the seller is misleading at best and at worst an outright thief. Disgusting. Had one of those ‚Äúbamboo‚Äù mattress covers for past several years that was great. Have this a try due to all the reviews for the new bed. This one feels way more plastic-y like vinyl. Huge bummer. I bought this to protect a new mattress from accidents by my toddler. He wet the bed and this did not protect the mattress at all. Definitely would not recommend this product. Looks good quality but thinner than expected. Will see how it works long term. I was looking for a waterproof mattress protector since our cat decided to urinate on our bed and ruined our mattress. Well she just did it again, but we were not too alarmed because we knew we had the protector in place. Not the case. It went right through it. Not sure if anyone else has had this sort of problem, but I thought from the reviews that this would be great. Not impressed at all. You can't tell which edge is which, and it is waterproof, so much so that the sheets slide around.  Will be replacing with something more substantial and stays in place. We tried this on a memory foam mattress that has a cooling gel feature. It didn‚Äôt do well to keep the cooling feature working. It was a hot sleep. May take two people to complete task. It is soft and durable would definitely buy again. Bought it as a gift I got this fir my Allergy and it has worked perfect! Plastic lining,, make your bed hole heat! To hot has plastic to make waterproof not what I had in mind will be replacing These protectors are awful. I have 4 total and all 4 leak through. I messaged the sellers to inquire about a warranty replacement for 2 and they stated I had to pay out of pocket to send them in for testing or they would only replace one. I accepted one replacement and it has been washed twice (using their directions as I always have) and already it leaks as well. Look elsewhere, especially if you are using them for a young child. Great quality, and my new mattress is not in any danger of accidents. Wish it would have fit more snugly Easy care but could be a bit more comfortable under the sheets. Does protect the mattress  well and is a great value Disappointed! Not water proof. I locked my cat in bedroom by accident and she peed in bad and all too cover, duvet, flat sheet, and protector leaked ... Affordable, but Hot and noisy. Might work well for a kid- or on a different kind of bed. I much prefer the Casper  mattress cover... but. This did ok till I could save up for the fancy one. World Fine. Had to wash to get rid of odor - took forever to dry - the material is rough, do not like this product and cannot return now it‚Äôs been washed. Liked how it protected my mattress. Easy to care for. This does fit a very deep twin mattress and extra long. This is one of the only ones we purchased that was sized correctly. The top is soft on the outside and heavy duty plastics against the bed. The sides however are cloth with no plastic coating, which means If it‚Äôs a big accident fluids may drip down sides and through to the mattress. Would not recommend for kids or heavy wetters Cat peed on it. Mattress was ruined. Not waterproof. I normally don‚Äôt leave reviews but this was such a waste of money. My son still has accidents at night and this does NOT keep the mattress dry. It soaks right through it. It doesn't look very durable but has not broke after a year of use. Plastic like Not liquid resistant at all Water resistance. Protects mattress. I am thrilled about this item  in every way..especially the depth of it. I like it very comfortable This matters cover did not protect my Purple mattress from a potty training 2 year old who climbed into bed with me last night. I'm so disappointed. Love this mattress protector it really protects This pad will suffice for my needs, but it has no ""padding"" like the cover I used to have - but so far, so good.  I have no complaints - it's just extremely thin fabric with no padding for comfort."
73,"Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, True Wireless Earbuds (Wireless Charging Case Included), Black ‚Äì US Version",Electronics,"The sound wasn't as great as I thought it would sound. I love them, but they are super sensitive! You have to touch them the right because I've tried to answer a call & ended up starting my music. They are a better fit than others that cost much more money I use these for about 6 hours a night 5 days a week, and there alright. After about a month the left side became much quieter than the right, its not dirty or anything and that messes with me pretty good witch is why I gave 3 stars I love these earbuds. I usually only buy Bose but these have an amazing sound. My only complaint is that the case won't hold a charge very long. Even without the buds in them. The buds themselves hold a charge just fine. The battery lasts about a week with an hour use each morning. The sound quality is fantastic with many options to adjust genre or customize the experience. The one downfall is they do hurt my ears a bit as these are ""in ear"" buds. I love how the case can charge your ear buds they work great. I highly recommend I've now gone through 2 pairs of the original galaxy buds and this pair of Buds plus. The first two pairs each lasted slightly over the year warranty, these only 9 months. Each time one of the ears got lower and lower in volume. The kicker is that you can't just replace one for a reasonable price, you have to replace both ears. I'm done with Samsung Buds in any form. The ambient noise is weird and sounds like crap, just a gimick feature. These are awesome and the only reason why I rated them 4 stars instead of 5 is because since I've had them, they've gotten stuck once on what sounded like a low volume in both buds . I searched to try and figure out how to fix it but I believe I just left them in the case for a while to correct themselves . Worked great for 1 year, then suddenly left earbud is very quiet. I took to the forums for solutions only to find this is a VERY common issue and all of the troubleshooting tips didn't work. Super bummed. Kinda pricey for only 1 year usage. I've been using the Galaxy Buds Plus with my Pixel 4a for about six months now, and I honestly can't fault them. The sound quality is excellent, they're comfortable, and they always connect the first time I open the case.I go riding with them for about 1.5 - 2 hours a few days a week, and they always stay in. The touch controls work fine, so I can pause and unpause quickly. The battery life is great too and I'm often surprised how much juice they have left in them after using them all week. The case holds a decent amount of extra charge.The downsides are the ambient noise option is just OK, and the touch controls can sometimes trigger when I'm adjust them in my ear. But overall, I like these a lot. I'm a studio musician so I'm constantly on the lookout for great sounding earbuds so after looking at many under the $150 I purchased these Galaxy buds plus. So let me start off by saying these earbuds are really cheap sounding and the quality just isn't there at all. I bought myself cheap $22 Bluetooth earphones and even they sound better than these.... I'm not knocking Samsung or push anyone away from buying thees but this is just my personal opinion. So please look elsewhere if your looking for sound quality, and if you something that is on the better side please check out Soundcore Liberty 2 pro's which has a full customizable EQ. I bought two sets exactly the same just different color. One pair still working fine, but the other pair after 9 moths, the right earbud stop working.  I'm so disappointed The left one works well, the right one is not quite as loud...I usually only wear one anyway. But when the left dies and I have to put the right one in, there is a very noticeable difference. And oddly enough, I have slight hearing loss in my left ear, but hear these better out of my left war.lol For the price, very pleased. There is better audio quality and noise cancelation out there, but not really at this price point. Overall great buds. Use them all day at work and haven't even had to put them in the case to recharge. Sound great. Probably just the shape of my ear, but I can't get them to fit snugly enough. And the touch feature is rough when I have to push the ear bud back to the right position. Also any drop of water hits the ear bud, which is not infrequent in my line of work, and the playback either pauses and unpauses or continually skips tracks Liked the product. Great call quality. Right bud broke, though. Can't return after only 8 months. Costco has a better return policy. Will shop there for electrical products from now on. They are cool when they work but I've had 2 sets that stopped charging the right earbuds. Do yourself a favor and don't get this generation. These earbuds give really good sound quality for what they are, and the touch controls work pretty well. As an overall package, they are still a better product than any of the other Samsung offerings (including the successors to this). If you have a Galaxy phone, even better as the seamless pairing works great. There are better buds (Sony's wf-1000xm4 are phenomenal) but you'll be paying more for them. Solid recommend Better sound than the previous model, fits well too. The one thing I really hate about these is the Galaxy Wearable app they seem to feel like they need to have. It seems install the app autonomously. I've had to uninstall the app at least three times since I bought the headset. Weak Volume These are easy to use and have great sound quality, but I just can't pump up the volume! (Yes, I have installed the app.) I still want a few more decibels.  Asked other people I know and they have the same opinion. So these have become the earbuds I use at work, which is perfect. They pair flawlessly with my phone every time I remove them from the case and they are super comfortable. Even without the eardrum destroying volume that I want, lol, they were worth the money. I've been using these for a couple weeks and overall, not terribly happy with them, but feel like it would be wrong to send them back now.For the sound quality, I think the price should be about half of what it is. I've had $10 earbuds that sounded better. The sound is thin and lacking bass of any kind. The app that controls these earbuds provides some rather basic and lackluster EQ adjustments. None of which really provides any quality alteration of the sound.The earbuds themselves, not terribly comfortable. I got these primarily to use at night since I have trouble sleeping without some sort of sound or music or whatever. These are definitely not earbuds that can be used if you're a side sleeper. I generally sleep on my right side, so I've had to resort to only using the left earbud. Not a great solution.I might have to go back to my $10 earbuds, I hate having the wires, but at least I could sleep with them and they sound better. Great sound but don't hold a charge very well. Just not worth the money Hello... Battery life of these buds is of less than a day. I used to have some Jaybird headphones that lasted 2 days on one charge. Then, moving on to quality of music playback... One word says it all: horrible. I compare the sound quality to the one that I got from an old Walkman using a $1 wired headphone. It is that bad! In less than a year, I had to send my buds for warranty repair twice. First, they were not charging at all or decharging from 100% to 0% in 30 mins. Then, buds were not connecting to anything over bluetooth. These are really bad! In regards to comfort, I would give them 3 stars. Style wise, I give them a 5. Noise cancelling and calling features are horrible as well. I live in a really quiet place and during my business calls I always get a: I cannot understand you. You are breaking off. I can barely hear you. Speak up, it is too low. Over 25 calls per day, for a year, I have always get a complain. Stay away from these. Right after the return window ran out, the right ear is now less than 40% of the volume of the left. So if you buy them, be sure to get the extended coverage on them. I like its secure fit Just 2 day after one year and left side dead due to not receiving charge. Sound echos.Made my ears ache with the rings on them but would fall out at the slightest bump without them.Sensor was touchy. The air from my hair dryer would turn them off. I wonder if my set was defective (it was renewed by Amazon, Galaxy buds plus white color). My experience is not as good as most reviewers here. The music quality was poor compared to low cost wireless sets from lesser brands. The battery drains fast (89% to 34% in about 16 hours of non use while not kept in charging box) even when disconnected from my phone (there is no on/off switch on the sets).  It stayed well in my ears during walks and paired easily.  The box charged wirelessly on my wireless phone charger. Not as good at cancelling out backround noise as i thought theyd b These sound awful. They are extreme v shaped. They also constantly cut out audio for half a second.  Inexcusable for this price. The buds pro sound great and didn‚Äôt have the connectivity issue. The only thing I can say for these is that they stay in the ear.It‚Äôs baffling so many companies have been making wireless earbuds for a while and most of them still have glaring problems.The equalizer presets all suck The equipment itself is great. Two stars are lost because the only way to get the functionality of the sound equalizer and noise cancellation is by connecting through Galaxy Wearable app, and the app only works if you give it access to your contacts of which there is no need and which is a privacy concern. The sound quality of these has really surprised me. I really enjoy bass in my music and these are excellent for that.  I also have the apple airpods and I can say I probably won't use the airpods again now. I had this since March 6. Around april 12 the sound quality almost diminished and even at max volume I can barely hear it. One of the buds was inoperable. I was however able to receive a full refund. Stopped working after 1 year. I am just not as impressed with these as I thought I would be for the price. If I wear them to the grocery store, I can barely hear my audiobook for example. I've tried a bunch of settings and just can't get them to perform the way I hoped. I should have just bought another $35 pair instead. My ears start to ache after 30-60 minutes. They aren't noise canceling the I find them a little bulky and uncomfortable in the ears. They are extremely touchy such as pausing music and changing song.. When exercising if I put my hand behind my head for a crunch the sensor would pause the music of change the song even if I just move my hair and brush the headphone by accident. Extremely quick delivery and good product Took me a while to make the purchase decision, when I finally got my samsung buds, oh boy there was no way it will stay in place, I tried every single piece of the rubbers to adjust and have it inplace... I was dropping out of my ears while working... going to the gym you name it. Best decision I ever made was to immediately return it. Horrible experience to me. These would not stay in. The quality is pretty good. The life of the battery is pretty good as well. The sound quality is great and I love the red buds. But, my major problem with these is that they do not fit well and are uncomfortable.  When I remove them, my ear canal is sore. For the price I was expecting more I returned them to buy a cheap pair airbuds. Products ear fittings started sliding on product after a month and made the device fall right out of ear now. They stretched out from having to reposition in ear and now there eorthless. Bought these many bcz my phone is Samsung so I expected top notch experience... all but. The sound quality is low,  hardly any bass and the left bud keeps having charging issues.  Very  disappointed üòû While I had high hopes for these, I was disappointed with the ongoing use:It seems they disconnect at times while connected to my computer and the most irritating part is that they fall off my ears - and it depends on weather I'm speaking more or less with them, I don't have to tell you how annoying it is to have these fall off while running. (Even with the largest of the ear caps)If I could do it again, I would buy a different brand.UPDATE: Even worse experience, Discord and computer use is subpar as it doesn't work in fullduplex mode for stereo listening and voice transmission - only handsfree mode. Used for cell phone. Does not fit ear. Lost one third day of wearing working out I honestly preferred the IndyEvo Skull Candy headphones I bought but they hurt my ears. These are nice. I wish they were water resistant. The other ones I mentioned had better sound quality, too. These are comfortable. Don't get these, mine disconnects all the time, during calls, during YouTube vids, during movies, doesn't matter what I'm doing. I don't know why, these things are freaking expensive to be disconnecting like that. Got these yesterday and so for the are amazing. Will update in 2 weeks Loved these until the right ear bud stopped working. I've only had these for 6 months. For $100+ they should have lasted longer. Terrible bass..I'm not a bass head by any means, but I do like a full rich sound..Considering all the hype about 2 drivers, one dedicated to mid a deep, I practically had to ram them down my ear canals to my brain to get the richness I was eager for when I bought them..I did a lot of research before hand, YT reviews and they were all saying that the buds were ""all that"", but I don't see it..After downloading the App, and using the equalizer, setting it for Bass Boost, all it did was dampen the music..The other settings did what they were meant to including Dynamic..I tried everything, all the ear tips, went into my phone sound settings and cranked up the bass in custom and barely had any effect..Sure the mids and highs are great, but that's it..My 59.00 pair if JLabs sound way better... I give it a 2 stars because after a while it seems to lose connection with whatever device I'm using and I'm in rang of the device.  The sound goes I'm and out and it dose that for a while, which it can be annoying. But overall the sound is good and they hold up very good. Very happy with my purchase. Got these when they started dropping the price so i ended up paying 80 or something. They are good earbuds, sounds is okay enough and its very convenient that they will just auto pair if you grab one. One minor problem with that is when my toddler opems the case, sound cuts out on my phone and goes to the earbuds. With the right tips, they are very comfortable and seal up well. I dont think getting the noise cancelling model would make much of a difference unless i was on a plane or something. Controls are simple and i dont know where the mic is, but it seems to pick up well when i am on phone calls. Very loud, Battery lasted quite a while which definitely helps for those long work shifts. Size is good, they don't feel like a bother as they're pretty light weight. My only issues would be the interference they get when you cover your phone with your hand ( doesn't happen too often). Or when it's up against something.  Overall, very worth its price. Quality is great. A must buy if you're in need of wireless earbuds. They are a little big and don't fit real snug.  They are OK though.  My first set of wireless so I don't have anything to compare with. I am very disappointed in the sound volume quality of these earbuds. First the right ear volume is sig significantly lower than the left ear. And it has only been getting worse over the months. Is gotten so bad the right are wisper quiet when the left side is a comfortable volume effectvly makibg them useless. Second issue is that I have to crank the volume to near max, again, just to have it a good listening volume. The functionality of these Buds is second-to-none. I have a set of Bose QuietComfort buds which are 3x the price. These Samsung buds have the best touch controls, the most options for touch inputs, and great range. The battery life is unreal. I regularly can go 10 hours on a charge, and the case will charge them up twice more. That's 30 hours of life. Sound quality is good. These are not studio-quality sound pieces. They do everything well, but nothing great. Volume could be louder, but I suspect this was done to increase use time. The Samsung Wear app is great, although I wish you had an EQ to set for these directly instead of having to do that in the main sound settings. Otherwise, I love them. If the Bose headphones WORKED as well as these (or if these sounded like the Bose Headphones) I would have no complaint. The case is small, they are easy to use. If you are mobile or moving all day, these are hands-down (pun intended) the best value and quality set of Buds you can get. I bought these in January 2021.  By April the right ear stopped working.  I did all the troubleshooting suggestions and it's still not working.  For the price of these, I expected a better quality product.  I can't get any support from Samsung.  I don't recommend these ear buds. When I have one in my ear the person on the phone could barely hear me. Volume sounds low when its turned all the way up Right bud stopped working after 6 months.  Too late to return to Amazon.  Contacted Samsung customer service.  Great to work with, good communications.  However, they did not stand up to what they promised.  I sent in my earbuds, along with the box, paperwork, and accessories it came with.  After evaluation, I was told the earbid was replaced.  When it was returned back to me, my is, my original packaging and accessories were not returned back to me.. In addition, the right ear bud again stopped working after one hour of use. when i 1st got it, it worked perfectly and i only needed to charge it once a week.  now almost a year later i had to replace it (i got the buds pro) b/c the left ear bud discharges at over 2x faster than the right ear bud.  after charging to 100% and 2 hours of use, the right ear bud would be at roughly 80% while the left ear bud somehow is at 45% or lower.  the charging case can't keep up with that level of discrepancy and so the ear buds never recharge to 100% and the left ear bud NEVER charges fully.  i pretty much have to charge the buds and case every day for 2 + hrs if i want to use it. I like my music loud enough to drown out my thoughts and these buds DO NOT get loud at all. You know that spot your phone stops at with earphons  and says any louder can be damaging to your ears well that's about as loud as these get. They were just ok.Very little noise canceling I use the ear buds every morning for my exercise workouts and walks.. The sound quality is really very good. I find the ear fit a little problematic on occasion (the buds sometimes like to fall out).. the buds come with several ear pieces that give you a pretty secure fit but as with everything else, nothing is perfect.  Charging the buds has also been a problem.. I've had occasion where one or the other bud fails to charge and I'm then using only one ear piece until I can get them both charged.. I have started putting the buds in the charger and sealing the case with a rubber band.. so far this has worked well.. I like the buds and for the price don't think they can be beat.. Definitely recommend them from Amazon as they were kind enough to replace the buds after one fell out and was crushed by a golf cart.. Great customer service.. I love the color. The sound quality is great Very unhappy as sound quality is ""tinny"", but more importantly, they keep falling out of the ear, no matter size adapter I use.  Would advise another manufacturer. ProsBeautiful color and fits inside the ear securelyConsBattery life Work well, I have smaller ears and the standard ear buds fit perfectly. Wear while running and they don't fall out. Easy to lose I would say the bass boosted signature is perfect if that's what you want but for podcasts and classical music it leaves more to be desired. The noise cancelation works for really well but the passthrough is lack luster. The battery and software are the best aspects. After reading and watching numerous reviews, I thought these would be my Go TWS ear buds. Not so fast. While I fell in love with the battery life and integration with my Samsung phone and tablet. I was less thrilled with the fit and comfort of these buds. Also the sound was just, ""meh"", you know nothing to really brag about. Anyway after trying different ear tips and still getting the same results or worse I ended up returning them. They keep having static, like old radio stations as you get out of range.But the phone in in my pocket! Even just drops connection.I have an S10 Ultra. The software seems ok. Battery.life is good.Loved my regular buds, but these leave a lot to be desired. I dislike that they fall out of my ears. I have used all the different sizes and they STILL slip out of me ear!When they are in my ears, they work great! Sound is great! Edit: After daily use since buying I think I'm done with all wireless earbuds. They sound great listening to music or connecting to my pc or TV to not wake up the house (usually up all night) but for phone calls literally every person I speak to asks if I can switch to the phone because I sound to them like I'm talking in a tin can or am very muffled. This is on a galaxy s10. When I use the wired with mic set that comes with the phone literally everyone says much better. I'm done waiting 100+ dollars to have to keep disconnecting them for a phone call.Love these way better than my regular 1st gen samsung buds charge is way longer sound it better I was satisfied with the sound quality and battery life but one of the buds stopped working after a month. This ended up being a huge waste of money. I am new to wearing buds. I really like these. I wear them at work when i need to concentrate. The tune out the voices and i can hear my smooth jazz in peace. i havent tried to answer the phone with them yet but they are quality. These are really good  they connect right away, was a like weird for my ears to get used to, but sound quality is awesome and everything else is! Have to get used to fit for ears The initial Buds I got, just sitting in the charge case, the battery ran out.  Had to send it back for repair.  Not happy.  Got it back from repair, battery still runs out.  Even less happy.  Customer service asked if I was happy now.  Said no, so they urged me to send the buds back for repair again.  I did, and they implied there was nothing wrong and were going to send them back.  I complained to customer service, and magically they decided to send me a whole new setup.  It works now.  I think the problem was with the charge case.Bottom line, Buds are good, Repair is poor, Customer service is good. Every time I move my head...the buds fall from the ears.  Frustrating!  Even more...they won't pair.  UGH! After close to year of use, left earbud stopped working.  I have tried cleaning it, taking off runner attachments and still no luck.  Right earbud still going strong. I bought these to wear at work so that I wouldn't have to deal with pressing any buttons. The touch controls on them are actually very nice and responsive, but the issue comes from the contoured shape of the bud. When pressing sometimes you can accidentally press the wrong part and not get the reaction that you're looking for from the headphones, which can be a little frustrating when you're trying to change a song on the fly and have to resort to using your phone because you can't quite get your finger right.Besides that there are many things to like about these. They're a nice size, not too big or too small, and they have a comfortable fit in your ear. For those people who enjoy the hooks it does come with a pair of the silicone hooks that are detachable if necessary. I found them to be a little uncomfortable because they didn't fully fit into my ear like they should have but it wasn't a big deal. The buds also look nice. They have a nice shiny finish and they aren't super conspicuous when they're in your ear. I also enjoy the small case, although it can be a little frustrating at times because sometimes it seems like it doesn't properly charge. I'll plug it in to charge, and while the headphones themselves will charge sometimes the case won't charge despite being plugged in for hours on end. I'm not sure if it's a case issue or if it's something else but it's little frustrating.Another frustrating thing about these are the connection issues. For reasons that I don't fully understand there are certain spots around my house where when I'm out and about walking, the connection will just go to crap. There are even times when the phone is been completely in front of my face or not too far away and my pants pocket and it will just completely go to garbage.The other major issue that I have is the sound quality. Now this is one that opinions might vary on, as everyone has their own feelings about sound quality. I wasn't expecting the greatest sound quality from these buds for the price, but I feel that for $100 then they should sound better than they do. Despite having multiple EQ settings, these buds still sound very flat, and they can be very quiet at times too. Now I know that there's a possibility that the sound mixes of the music that I listen to are just mixed very quietly, but I don't think that's necessarily the case, as when I tried with different pairs of headphones such as a wired pair and another wireless pair that I own, I got much louder fuller sound from them.The battery life is actually surprisingly good. With the audio pass through enabled they last maybe 4 to 5 hours, with the pass-through off they last six to seven. More than enough to get me through a shift at work without having to worry about them dying, or even having to charge them on breaks.Overall I think these are decent budget headphones, but the sound quality can be iffy for some, and the connection issues might be problematic for many. I personally can't recommend these when you can buy superior sounding headphones for just a little bit more, but if you're just looking for a pair of budget headphones to get you through work with touch controls that are fairly responsive, these are for you. I really like this product. The sound is amazing. The one issue, though I can be a big issue, I have is, when I work out and I start sweating they fall out of my ears. Got these on sale and they were worth every penny. I use them often at work, being able to use one bud doubles my battery life so they will last me a few days without needing to charge the case. I charge the case maybe every three days depending in how much I use them.  The only thing I do not like is they don't stay in your ear if you're sweaty they pop out of my ear often if I am moving and getting hot but aside from that I live these buds. They have a great range and the mic is clear when I am taking a call Sound is inconsistance ranging from tinny to medium soft with way, way insufficient bass response. I have $30 earbud that sound 5 times as good as these. I bought these on a recommendation and these are unbelievably poor quality. I thought that spending over $100 on a product by Samsung would produce stellar results. THESE ARE TOTAL TRASH. DO NOT BUY THESE. Another nuisance issue is that these interrupt my Macbook Pro's microphone to sound much the same, very tinny. Disconnect the earbuds and the microphone comes back to life. Sound on iPhone also is tinny. Very poor product. I've had these buds for a couple months now, and I use them for listening to TV shows in bed and audiobooks generally.  For that, they're 5-star buds.  All-night battery charge.  I can use them individually rather than both at once.  Bluetooth range is good -- I can walk 30-50' away from my phone (Pixel 5) with no issues.I misplaced them for a week and was on the verge of ordering another pair when I found them -- that's how much I like them.But it turns out that I'd never tried them for music until today.  There's *no* bass.  N-o-n-e.  I couldn't listen to music that I'm very familiar with because the sound was so off that it was disturbing and I couldn't concentrate on what I was working on.I switched over to my Google Pixel Buds, which have great sound (and active noise cancelling) but dogsh*t battery life and range.So: If you're looking for comfortable, long-lasting earbuds for watching TV or listening to audiobooks, then these Samsung buds are fantastic.  If you listen to a lot of music, I'd consider something else. It doesn't stay in my ear as well as I want it to but it's the best one I've found so far that fits my ear Easy to set up and use. Preface by saying I'm not an audiophile perfectionist. But these work great for me - you can quickly, with a few taps, adjust the volume, fast forward, or turn off and on. And they stay in my ears. The sound is good. So for me, a winner!Also happy with the little case that keeps the buds charged and un-lost. Had the earbuds for just over a year, and the right bud will not charge, which means I cannot use it.  I did not drop it in water or hard surface.  Had been using them daily for workouts and travel.  I cannot get the seller to return emails. I'm looking for the right replacement or instructions on what can be done.Sandra DNJ I absolutely adore mine and would recommend to anyone! Great product. Leagues above the rest! Right one stopped working after about 9 months. I've done everything Samsung has told me to do. So bummed! Wanted the blue ones but they screwed up shipping. Had to get 2nd choice, the white ones. Long battery life. Usually only wear 1 as I drive a truck. I can switch one out and they last like 20 hours that way. I LOVE that the case holds a charge and recharge them when placed it the case . This is a fantastic product when it works.Pros: The battery life is amazing, the sound quality is outstanding for calls, very good for music but bass was not that great.Cons: Bought in October, failed in December, right bud died. Samsung replaced it for free (excellent customer support), two weeks later a new pair arrived, two weeks later after using 10 times; left bud failed. would occasionally work well, but sometimes would give an error (battery at 1%) and won't connect. Again, Samsung offered a replacement, but I did not like the idea of waiting 2-3 weeks to get a replacement that is likely to fail as well. Amazon accepted return. I would love nothing more than to own these buds if they were more reliable, but they obviously cut corners on quality control. It will not hold a charge on the left side. I bought these 3 months ago and can't get any support from Amazon. I would not recommend this item. I've had these for a while. They are great but have some issues: 1)It always seems the battery drains quick even when I don't use it. I read somewhere where the experimental pass-through audio does keep the battery on so even though I like that feature, I keep it off. I have generic $20 wireless earbuds from Walmart that don't have any features but the battery lasts longer.2) I've noticed when I look up, there is a second where the connection suffers and the audio skips. I don't understand why but every time I look up, this happens. Doesn't happen with my generic $20 buds.3) There was also an issue where the right bud just stop being recognized and it turns it the battery died and instead of charging it, the case thinks it's already charged, judging by the charging lights. I had to keep taking them out and putting them back, back and forth until it finally starts changing.This happened twice to the right bud and once to the left. It is very annoying especially before I knew what was going on. Spent hours researching it and trying different things. My $20 generic earbuds are more reliable and never had an issue like this.I honestly wouldn't buy them again and even though I'm tempted to replace them with the Pro version, because I am a big Samsung guy, i am very hesitant to do so and will probably want a while more before trusting them again Left bud is phasing out and makes a horrible noise. 2nd pair , now I'm done with these. They actually last a decent amount of time and being able to charge them right in the case is also a plus Easy to connect,  fits well,  great battery life. Fits well in the ear and sounds full and true. Controls are buttery smooth and intuitive. Would like the case to snap securely when closed but overall I‚Äôm happy with the purchase. I have owned every kind of headphones you can imagine and I have never, ever had a pair with worse sound quality. It is like listening to music or podcasts through an empty Coke can. You would be better off with $10 headphones. Much better off. These headphones are the worst garbage ever. They cut out so much if your device is more than 2 feet away. Often times struggle to connect and then if they won't connect devices don't want to remove them to repair. This product is a nightmare and Samsungs warranty is terrible. Works well but too big for my ears Not easy to keep them in your ears. its a nice earbud but not matter what size i change it to it keeps falling out my ear and its annoying. The left earbud was way quieter than the right one. No matter what I did it nothing helped. Not to mention the case really badly scratched up. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you purchasing anything from this company. Uncomfortable. Anyway you try it. Cannot wear for a long time Had these for about a year and I've tried everything listed on all the support forums but my right earbud is still very noticeably quieter than my left. It's my hearing because it's still just as noticeable if I switch ears. They‚Äôre great! Ambient sound is really helpful when I need to be aware of my surroundings, and the noise cancellation is really good for when I just want to focus. I did give it 4 stars for 3 kind of nit-picky reasons: you can‚Äôt turn the volume up or down through the shortcuts on the earbuds themselves, and when you do use shortcuts to pause, skip or reply, the touch controls are inconsistently sensitive. Sometimes it won‚Äôt register my touch, other times it spazzes out like I pressed it too many times and replays the song. It‚Äôs pretty inconsistent. The third reason is that, though the ambient sound is helpful, it picks up a pencil falling halfway across the room way better than someone right next to me trying to ask me a question. Sometimes I have the ambient sound on for when a coworker needs to speak with me, but it‚Äôs a little frustrating that I can hear papers rustling at a desk 30 yards away clear as day but still have to pause the music to be able to hear the person right next to me. Other than that though, they‚Äôre great! A lot of earbuds feel painful or uncomfortable after a couple hours of use. These feel great by comparison, and don't make my ears sore. Might work for some people, but I did not like them at all. The Samsung app asks permission for everything. I uninstalled it right after I decided to return. Also, anytime I touched an earbud to adjust the earpiece, it would stop the audiobook and start Spotify even though I had no Spotify controls programmed in. The sound quality was worse than my bluetooth speakers or over the ear headphones. Lastly, the mic would not pick up my voice on calls very well at all. Definitely a no go for me. I loved these. It only arrived with one ear bud but since it still worked I decided to just deal with it and it has very nice, crisp sound and people can hear me clearly over the phone even with just one. But now the charge is not working anymore. The case will say it's charged but it will no longer charge the earbud unless it's directly plugged in. Which is a pain when I get to work and don't have a charger thinking the case had charged my earbud. Very disappointed. I've only had it for 1 month. Sound and fit good. They do start to come loose when I start sweating, but besides that they are great. My favorite ear buds. The sound is great. These are the only ones stay in my ear perfectly without falling out or any discomfort. I bought these with high hopes they would help me hear a little better since they amplified sounds.  Well they amplified everything but voices.  Every paper crinkle, machine noise, water but I still couldn‚Äôt make out the voices in the room. I also found them very tinny sounding.  I tried different ear pieces to no avail. They did block noises well when listening to music or audio books Just not for me. I wish I could get my money back this terrible product goes Dead in 15mins always losing connection sometime it will not charge up. The sound quality is hit or miss.What is really annoying about these is that you can pause, play, forward, etc. by tapping the outide of the earbud.  Something your own ear does accidentally.  It's rare that you will hear a song in its entirety unless you are sitting motionless while using these buds. Wtf is wrong with these expensive earbuds that won't stay in the ear? Both hubby and I bought a set. Too heavy,  so fall out of our ears just sitting at a computer. It still hurts my ear canal even with all the tips Love them,works grate ,just not loud enough for the price PROS: the color is adorable..CONS: noise cancellation is horrible, i work in a weldshop and i have cheap earbuds that are more like earplugs..also, sound quality is horrible. NO BASS, and they need to be turned up louder than other headsets/earbuds. Fit good and don't fall out left side stopped charging and I only had this for a couple months.  disappointed It requires complete access to your phone Or it wont work I've enjoyed these.  Not too much on sound canceling, but sound great for what I need. I bought these mainly for the ambient feature cause I have a hearing loss in my left ear very slight and it magnifies everything around you and it allows you to hear better. But it obviously is not hearing aids, but it allows you to hear what's going on around you when you're out walking or riding your bike.while listing to your music or on  the phone.  I do not recommend for running. When you sweat they fall out but this is my experience with them. I have used different loops and tips still falls out. Others may not have this issue. Very Good Not Great. Reliable and worth the money. I did a lot of research when looking for a new pair of ear buds, and I read a lot of reviews that said these were good for the price (I agree). However, the description that includes these as good buds for running is way off. I don't run very far - maybe 3 or 4 miles at a time - and they fall out constantly. I have put them in every position possible and changed the size of the rubber bud, and nothing works. I thought maybe when it got warmer things would change - nope - they still fall out. The only reason I have buds is for running, so it is very frustrating. I purchased from the reviews I read.  So, I am really confused for the 5-star ratings.These are no better than my $29.00 iPods.NO base at all.SAVE your money. While sound quality is good, that doesn't matter much if they won't stay in your ears. I've tried every variation of the ear tips and yet I have to adjust them every few minutes or they will fall out. Constant adjusting has also caused sores in my ear canals. Product defective or fake ,sounded worse than $10 samsung headphones. Barely had them for a year and I'm having issues with the left ear bud. If I just have the left ear bud in I have to turn the volume to max to hear anything. The right side ear bud is working perfectly. Not happy. Pros:-- Battery life is phenomenal.  These earbuds are rated for 11 hours of playback.  It helps that they don't have ANC, which can really drain the battery.  One of the annoyances from my Sony WF-1000XM3s is that they only have around 3.5 hours of battery life with ANC on, and if you turn ANC off, the background sound is pumped in and sounds terrible.  The sound isolation is good enough to really muffle outside distractions with the Buds+, and in exchange for giving up ANC, you get battery life that's nothing short of amazing.  The next time I go to the gym, these are coming with me.  They will either supplement my XM3s when they inevitably die during my workout, or they'll replace them altogether.-- Good sound.  Things don't sound muddy or muffled.  You won't mistake these for Sony XM4s, but you won't have to shell out $280, either.-- Good touch controls.  Almost everything you could need would be here.  Skip tracks, go back, raise and lower volume.-- Wireless charging-- Very good noise isolation, if you find the right fit for the ear tips.-- The case is very small and pocketable.  (I'm impressed with this, coming from the Sony WF-1000XM3s.)Cons:-- No active noise cancellation.  I know these earbuds aren't exactly new at this point, but there are earbuds for < $100 that include ANC.-- The voice assistant support is all but useless if you lock your phone.  I have the Alexa app on my phone, and use Amazon Music as my service.  In order to do anything with Alexa on these earbuds, the phone has to be unlocked and the Alexa app open.  If I have the phone unlocked and the app open, I might as well control music from my phone.*UPDATE ON THIS LAST POINT*:I've enjoyed using Google Assistant with these earbuds.  You can open Amazon Music with Google Assistant (including waking up the phone, if the screen is off), and you can play whatever you left off with.  So with Amazon Music, I usually just play my Discovery mix.If ANC is a must-have for you, look elsewhere.  (e.g., the Galaxy Buds Pro) But if decent sound and long battery life are your priorities, I can safely recommend the Galaxy Buds+. Everything was great until the left ear bud stop working after 4 months. Doesn't even charge even though the charging light is on. Trying something else next time. They will not stay in my ears. These buds are great when they work. However, based on my experience with two orders, I've noticed the one side of the ear, either right or left, will lose sound. The bigger headache is samsung support. You have to mail the earbuds to a facility. One time, they asked me to pay for the repair cost. Another time, they sent me back the earbuds after they told me a part was missing which took another half-week. So, I had to buy another empty package, and create a ticket just to send the earbuds back again to support which took another week. Overall, if you like earbuds that last three months, then go ahead and make this purchase. fast delivery,  good quality Pros:1. The color, I purchased the red ones and both the red case and earbuds look nice.2. The battery life is good.3. They stay connected to my phone or computer.Cons:1. Sound, its bad.  Make sure you use the right sized ear piece to get the best sound.  And them shove them in your ear as far as comfortably possible to hear any bass.  Very tinny, absolutely no sound stage, everything is flat, regardless of the Wearable app ‚ÄúEQ‚Äù settings you us.2. Bluetooth connection.  I have not had any issues with the earbuds randomly disconnecting like I have with apple airpods (which is why I bought these, to replace them) but I have had de-synching issues where they play the sounds slightly out of time.  And that is just as bad.3. Fit.  Its not great.  As mentioned above, you have to shove them in your ear to get the best sound these are capable of making.  And they are just not very comfortable for any extended use.4. The app is pretty much useless.  Everyone wants to make an app, but is less about offering you more features and more about farming you for data.5. Background noise.  These things pick up noises you didn‚Äôt know where even there and if you are on the phone, the person you are talking to will hear them too.  Did you know your pants make loud noises when you walk, or that when your dog walks across the hard would floor it sounds like someone is drumming to their steps?  Well get these bad boys and you will find out son! This buds is good, I'm just disappointed with the battery, it easily get drained even if I didn't used it so often. Great sound Quality, easy to use and beautiful color. My favorite earbuds. Not sure if this is normal but the left side doesn't fomit in my ear without hurting. I've tried all the pieces to make it different sizes and none of them make it better. The sound is a lot lower in that ear piece as well. Really disappointing but still the better of all the ear buds I've tried. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The quality of these headphones to say the least are terrible. I am extremely disappointed the left earbud is extremely loud and the right can barely be heard. Thank God I bought these as a backup pair. I am certain I will be returning. Great battery life. Good quality of sound. Haven't had no issues so far Got these at the beginning of the year (2021). I use them with my iPhone 11 Pro. As far as connectivity, reliability, battery life, charge time, call quality, and sound goes: they're solid. I'm very happy with them.They don't have active noise-cancellation, but if you turn off the Ambient Sound feature, it blocks a lot of noise out, especially if you're listening to something. I personally don't like active noise-cancellation, because it gives me headaches, so this is a good fit for me.Speaking of fit, I have yet to have an issue with them falling out of my ears or anything like that. I've been using them daily for 5 months. From chores around the apartment to working out, they've stayed in place without any real issue.My only complaint is there's latency with video and games. Netflix seems to be ok, there's a little with YouTube. Gaming has a lot of latency/delay issues with the audio, though. Rhythm-based games on the iPhone while using these earbuds? Forget it. I've looked it up, if I were on Samsung, there's a gaming mode with the Galaxy Buds App that apparently mitigates this issue. That features doesn't exist in the iOS version. Maybe it will someday...I mainly just listen to music and podcasts, and to talk on the phone, so this latency/delay thing isn't a big issue for me. The volume on my ear buds don't work.  You can turn up the volume by touching right for turning up and left for down and neither of them work. These must be knock offs not original."
74,Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 Wi-Fi 32GB Silver (SM-T500NZSAXAR),Computers,"Not as easy to navigate as older models. Screen rotation for one.Trusted Samsung name. Regret my decision. This generation has a better screen than its predecessor, but the much narrower frame makes it very difficult not to inadvertently change what you are looking at. In addition, the newest Chrome and Android software continually sends intrusive messages and can't be turned off.  As a device intended primarily for web browsing and program streaming this is not acceptable. Will not run some apps. Don't think this pad is authentic Samsung. Not sure, but it's pissing me off. It's an old tablet that AT&T couldn't sell in 2016/17 and auctioned off. I generally love Samsung products this would make my 2nd tablet I don't like the a7. It glitches with any screensavers on there and the touchscreen is not good it gets stuck . I'm in able to take screenshots . This is after having the product for 9 months now."
75,"SanDisk - SDDDC2-128G-G46 128GB Ultra Dual Drive USB Type-C - USB-C, USB 3.1 - SDDDC2-128G-G46 Gray",Computers,"A number of reviews did warn about the slow speed of the drive, but I purchased it to keep a backup of my photos. It is definitely slow and the file transfer takes a long-long time!Moreover, be warned about the capacity... 256 GB drive has an actual capacity of 232 GB only. The slide mechanism no longer hold the drive in place.  Can not insert it into the drive slot on pc.  Useless now. The ability to switch between USB 3 and USB-C worked for about a month. I sent it back to SanDisk and they repaired/replaced it. It's been about a month now and the USB-C is not functioning again. working really good with both usb and type c, not expensive and helpful Will not make connection if you have a case on your Surface.  Make sure you have plenty of clear space around your USB c port to allow for the large housing of this flash drive.Bought 2 of them and when I went to use the second, it was not recognized by either USC connection.  Device was dead.Had to file a warranty claim with San Disk.  Now waiting for a replacement device. Not actually a USB 3.1. Product is 3.0. Still an acceptable flash drive. Just not the product I purchased. This flash drive is great if you need to travel with it as it is very small. Having both a USB 3.1 and a USB-C output ensures that your files can be accessed on both newer and older computers. This is convenient as some of my school computers did not have any USB-C ports and my MacBook only has USB-C ports. Transferring files and working on projects with this flash drive made it easier to bridge the gap between old and new hardware. I would recommend adding a Lynard or keychain ring in the box. Price was affordable and I was able to get a lot more storage! I think that the build quality needs to be improved. It seemed to be made of cheaper plastic and did not feel that durable to me. If you need something that will withstand more damage I would consider getting a flash drive made from metal. This will not plug into an iPad with any type of case on it, pointless to own if I have to remove my case every time . Does not plug into cellphone with a case on it, have to remove case to plug the SanDisk in. The flashdrive is very useful with the dual connections, but there are times when I am trying to plug in the USB A side and the part ends up sliding back into the casing instead of plugging into the computer. May just be my way of plugging the USB in. Overall, would recommend as you an just plug into pc or phone with USB C connection and transfer data or just utilize as a portable external storage. Awesome product I bought this usb in preparation for a trip in case file transfer from phone to computer was needed. Fast forward a month, I finally get a chance to use the USB, it into my computer and what do we see?4MB capacity. Can't speak much for the write speed as 4mb capacity (3.7 Mb writable) doesn't allow for much testing. What a scam.My advice, check the drive immediately after purchase. A whole bunch of storage for very little cash and space. Love having dual option of USB-C and USB.  Super fast data transfer.Was backing up about 90GB of data for move to new PC and it worked flawlessly!!! This ""chip""  is not to bad as far as speed goes.  That is to say it is not horrible  but  it is  not great either.The USB-c side just does not seem to make connection in my laptop  with a USB-c  port my usb-c  hubs  do not seem to have any issues.Sadly it was the USB-c side that  I was hoping to gain better speeds through. when  connecting to my laptop Fake given specifications Works flawlessly thus far. I bought this in128 gb it works fine with the new 2019 macbook pro for anyone wondering. Since the new macbooks only have usb c ports, this device is good for both regular transferring files to usb a and c devices. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt work with the ipad pro. I have the 2018 ipad pro 12.9 inch. When i conncect it. It just opens my photos app. Idk if im doing something wrong but at the moment its not working for ipads When teaching I move between a Mac laprop with usb c ports to a PC with older USB ports to a desktop Mac also with older USB ports. This drive has made life so much easier! There was nothing I disliked with this infarct am gonna need another one Flimsy and slow. Will retract back when inserted. Its 2021, the quality is not up to the modern standards. Great Product and easy to use. You need to download the app on your phone to use this device. It is the SanDisk Memory Zone App. Also, if you have a computer with USB ports in the front of the tower, don't use those, use the one in the back. I have a Bluetooth mouse usb port plugged into the front of my tower and when I put in the Sandisk usb it made my mouse stop working. Once I plugged the Sandisk in the back of my tower, my mouse continued to work along with the Sandisk. The actual USB-A/3.0 and USB-C part is fine. The storage capacity is fine. The proprietary software that all of these come with is fine. The problem here is similar to a lot of hybrid drives: the mechanism to change from one to another is flimsy. After just a couple months of ownership (and probably only a couple dozen times of inserting and removing) the snap that holds the connector in place to plug in has completely failed. Just a little pressure causes the connectors to retreat into the casing. You have to hold down the little level for switching between connectors while you push the drive in, and it's an extremely awkward movement. I guess I'm still on the lookout for the perfect USB-A/C drive. First, both the Type A and C connectors are a loose fit and it keeps falling out of devices.  Downloaded Sandisk's app but it does not recognize the device on my Note 9.  Now, I am a computer professional and could probably figure out how to get it to work but devices should be plug and play.  BTW, ran bluestacks with the sandisk memory zone app and it does not see it either.  How did this ever get cleared for distribution by Sandisk Quality - RETURNING The USB-C side doesn't work after 5 months of normal use. Disappointed, I want to buy another USB-C flash drive, just couldn't found a proper one. Yes, this flashdrive is just as slow as other reviewers have pointed out. And yes, it can even get a little warm when in use. But, if you need to regularly move things between a device with only USB-C ports and a device with only USB-A ports, this is your best option for now. The slider works very nicely and it is comfortable to the touch. It clicks in place well. When I compare it to my old flash drive, I just feel that this one gets a little hot. Once it was plugged into my laptop, but the laptop complained that it was not plugged in. I never had that experience with my old flash drive, but it happened to me just once. Overall, I give it 4 stars. Fit my MAC but nothing happeded.  Couldnt down load etc.  Did not fit IPAD or Iphone. This is such a great invention. I had been trying to figure out how to get files off my phone and on to a USB drive without transferring them to a cloud so I could get to them from a computer. I looked at adapters but then found this.It actually doesn't fit with my case on, but I have a phone charging extension cord that has a female USB-C, and I just plugged it in to that and it worked fine.The speed seemed fine to me. Today I transferred about 500 short mp4s and about 3000 jpegs and it did all of them within I'd say 5 minutes. I guess that's not SUPER fast, but it was fine for my needs. It got kind of hot during use, but I don't think that's a problem. The first one I received was defective on the USB side. I sent it back and received this one which works, IF you press really hard on the USB and the C side both. Very stiff. I'm not a very happy customer. I hope they improve their product in the coming iterations. It's a great idea, just needs a lot of improvements. No, I don't recommend this product. The item is great and extremely portable I have had no issues and it works flawlessly Fits my needs. Nice The construction quality is very poor and feels flimsy. I feel like it could brake anytime while using it. Other than that, it seems to do what it's supposed to. This little thing is HUGE in what it can store.  It is reasonable fast, working at USB 3 speed.  I put all my photos on it (130 GB) and still have room for what I'll probably shoot in the remaining years of my life.  My only small gripe is that the slide is hard to operate.  It can go into either a C type or USB 3 connection, but it does not slide easily.  Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars. I've been using this Pendrive to watch movies on my TV, and every time I use the eject option before I remove this. but after one week of usage, it's getting slow. First off, the device does work. However, it's design is less than adequate when trying to use it. I liked the idea of having both USB A and C ends on it. Too bad it becomes difficult to use very quickly.It's designed to be able to either slide out the standard USB A or USB C sides depending on your needs. The mechanism that holds either end out while trying to use it fails and it becomes rather difficult to use. The USB C side very quickly stopped being able to lock into it's usable ""out"" stage. You can still use the memory stick but it becomes much harder as you have to hold the slide tab in place while inserting into a device. The USB A side still ""locks"" into place but that ""lock"" still is not enough to hold the end out while inserting into a device. Either end gets pushed back into itself when trying to use it.I was hoping for more. I've been purchasing SanDisk products regularly for years. As the head of the IT department, I distribute USB Flash Drives to co-workers on a regular basis. As a photographer I use SanDisk products exclusively. Well.... I couldn't be more disappointed in this product. The quality control on them is atrocious and perhaps the design is in part to blame. I was hoping the would work for the growing number of USB C laptops we deploy. They're just not going to work out.After some use, several have become ""stuck"" and the connector wont slide out without what most people would consider undue force. That's probably due to poor design. I haven't bothered to crack one open to see what the real issue is--I don't think SanDisk has either. Other users find these flash drives have simply been problematic on insertion and the subsequent pullout/reinsert loop results in the OS simply never recognizing the device. Sometimes when inserting the drive, the whole connector collapses back into the shell like a recalcitrant turtle.My users are frustrated, I'm frustrated. I'm just going to go back to the tried and true standard versions along with telling the users ""please don't lose your USB A to USB C adapter"". Maybe I'll switch to another style, but be forewarned about sliding/conversion versions ESPECIALLY if the mechanism is fully enclosed in a shell. With the newer cases used would be better to have a longer micro-c usb side. Right now with an Otter case (on Galaxy S10+) you have to take the case off just to use it. An adapter would be very helpful. I tried it in all 3 USB C ports and it was too tight.  I was afraid to force it and mess up my ports on my brand new laptop.  I tried 5 or 6 other USB C devices and they all plugged in just fine with no force required.  It kinda had a ""rough/scratchy"" feeling to it when I tried to plug it in.  I am disappointed because I have used SanDisk products such as these almost exclusively for many, many years.  This is very small and a great design with lots of storage space, but not at the risk of ruining my laptop.  Returned it. Small and appears to do the job. Had trouble connecting to the computer a couple of times but appears to be working now. Now my favorite item but an okay buy. I was hopeful when I saw this device.  But when I tried to put it in my phones, I found out the slots on both of my phones are narrower than the insertable part.  So disappointing.On the bright side, the USB port fit my computer, but it's defeating the purpose to have a dual drive that can only be used singularly... This drive is very slow, slower than a normal usb 3 device, thought it could be faster because of the usb c connection, but it transfers data very slow, filling 256 gb is going to take a long long time. These things are great! Easy data transfers from/to computer or phone. So glad I bought two. The flash drive works as advertised (I haven't bothered checking for speeds), but my reason for not giving it five stars is because of how hot it gets.  It gets uncomfortably hot after transferring one file.  I don't believe electronics that are constantly overheating can last very long.  I worry that it will die on me when I least expect it.  Other than that, I love that I can switch easily between regular USB type A and USB type C. this product is great, easy to use and portable, the issue is that the holes made to attach this to a lanyard are very shallow which makes it incredibly hard to get a jump ring inside it unless you've got a very small one sitting around, same goes for the thin string type of lanyards you usually see on sell phone charms, it was impossible for me to get one on, this is annoying since the drive is so small.My biggest issues with this product is that it just isn't well built, I bought it in July and it is now October, I've used it a total of 5 times since purchase and keep it in my laptop bag. It's broken and the USB-C side sinks back in when trying to plug it into my phone. When it is plugged in, the phone reads it only for it to immediately eject itself as if it wasn't plugged in, this also happens when transferring files which can be a problem too.I love the convenience of this product otherwise and I'm sure this is just a one off, but I won't bother repurchasing. Like I've said, I've only had it a few months and used it a handful of times, it's protected when not in use and it already broke Type C was hard to input. Had to force into the port. Had replacement and it done the same thing. Good product, except the lock. It can't look either way for USB or USB-C. Need improvement for the lock. Now it is kind of annoying. I bought two hoping I could use this drive to both record dashcam video in my Tesla Model 3 and be able to view the video on my Samsung S10+ phone.  I could not get either drive to be recognized by the car.  I formatted it several times with my PC using NTFS and it did not work.  My computer could see it but my car could not.  Returned the item. This thing has messed up twice now already and all i've done is try to copy some stuff to it. It gets EXTREMELY hot..... This is not a usable device. Save your money get a different brand. üëçüëçüëçüòÄüòÄüòÄ Really like the dual USB functionality. It's just really easy to loose and the holes for a key ring don't really allow many types of rings This flash drive is small and convenient for transferring media between Android phones and other devices. Does not work if u have a case on your phone. I used this 3 times to back up photos and the slider piece broke that sides out which port you need to use.  I thought scan disk was better than that. Of course, I happens after the return deadline. Great!! It does the job but frame is horrible it doesn't click on the USB 2, the USB c does so basically I have to hole my thumb on the the slider really firmly so it can get in to my pc. Sometimes it would take a while until I see it on my MacBook and sometimes it doesn't at all USB AND USB-C IN ONE... VERY USEFUL!! Seems not original one...Not functioning properly all the time I have a new Pixel 4A and I wanted to transfer mp3 music files to my phone from my desktop. This used to be easy and direct with one hookup cable on Android but even with trying numerous file management programs I just couldn't get it to work. Luckily SanDisk has the solution. This flash drive has connectors for both my phone and my desktop as well as a program that runs on my phone to help me easily transfer the files. Highly recommended - saves a lot of time and grief. Wish the capacity was a little larger and the phone connector was a little longer (have to remove my Otterbox case to insert it) but these are minor complaints. Bottom line is that this combination of program and hardware works great and solves a big problem at very reasonable cost! a lanyard or other ring would have been nice, difficult to add. Works as a windows media installer and dual phone spare backup drive. Very quick transfer rates, the mech that holds it in place when extended to one or the other is not well built This flash drive can be finicky to insert in my MacBook, I think it actually damaged one of my ports. Doesn‚Äôt seem to fit correctly and I cannot get it to connect properly without an uncomfortable amount of pressure so I don‚Äôt use it much. Maybe I will through a USB hub but that‚Äôs it. Would of returned it if was more expensive. Received this item. Tried to connect this item to my Samsung Galaxy Mote 8 for copying the data, and the Type C connector on SanDisk Dual Drive is not even fitting properly to my mobile, due to which the drive is getting not detectable by Samsung Mobile. It looks faulty.  But USB Connector is connecting to Laptop properly. Product is easy to use. Used this to transfer RAW files from my iPad Pro. It took an eternity to transfer, or so I thought. When I tried accessing these photos on my Macbook, they simply weren't there....you had one job... Overall a good product. Download and upload speeds are quick. You will have to download app. Not sure how important it is for some, but I know it is for me, removing from package is easy. I know sometimes they way electronic devices package requires scissors or your fighting to remove it, not the case with this one. Loose fitting attachments, refuses to connect to Samsung S21Plus and S21Ultra both of which I bought this flash drive for backing up data. I have returned this item and have been credited for it.However, Sandisk's 256GB SDCZ460 stick connects up to those phones with no problems whatsoever. No more adapters! One compact device that works seamlessly across usb c and usb a devices. Very cool! I should have read the negative reviews more carefully: The write speed is ridiculously slow. What's worse, in minutes, the usb stick gets quite hot. That's either a bad design or defective hardware or both. Either way, the Amazon return window is now closed, so I'm stuck with this useless usb stick, but I hope others will pay heed. This little stick  is very fast compared to a lower cost USB stick I have.  It works great with USB A and USB C.  I accidentally ran it through a wash/dry cycle and it still works! I bought this item back in JUly, 2019 and just discovered that this item is not what it was sold as. The storage capacity advertised was 256GB, but it took me just over 1 year to fill it up and I then realized it has a capacity of only 32 GB. Buyer beware! it's great USB 3.1 implies that this is a fast USB drive. Sent the first one back for replacement because it's write speed was so much slower than my ancient USB drives. Replacement was also slow. Checked SanDisk website, and they don't even publish a write speed, while the published read speed is vastly slower than USB 3.1 implies. 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-580 came with built-in dashcam but you have to provide storage in any one of the four USB-C ports. Vehicle recognized this thumb-drive instantly and recorded on a plug and play basis. Can take it to my computer and view it there or plug it into a Sumsung 82"" smart TV for big screen viewing. Petty cool to be able to review a scenic trip that way. Hope I never have to use it to prove who was a fault in an accident but at least I have that protection in a simple to use device. Buyers beware!! So, I got this device for a MacBook Air 2018 model with USB C. It is very difficult to plug in the device. It almost feels like you will either break the drive or the USB connector on the laptop. Just be careful. Convenient and reliable,  super helpful to have both USB-C and USB-A on the same device. Slide tab broke immediately which makes difficult to switch sides. It‚Äôs not 128GB it‚Äôs 32GB. What a shame Not a lot to say but it works as expected. Use it to backup Linux machine. Works great for that job. Good little dual type flashdrive... Design is a little wonky but good otherwise. Amazing. Quality build and SMALLER than ir looks. USB C end broke after 8 weeks with very little use write speed is 20mb/s maximum the plug is taking some use to, regardless of which side you wish to plug it in, you always have to excerpt a little extra force until you feel a click. Otherwise, it won't connect. Beside that, it works flawlessly. How did I live without this device.  It‚Äôs like a floppy drive for the modern age.  I have to transfer a lot of large video files between my iPad Pro and my PC.  Sure I could try to do that over a network or the cloud or whatever.  But this is SO much faster.  With iOS Files app finally making this possible, this is a time saving device. The overall build quality a little rough around the edges and it feels rather cheap but the speeds are nice and fast. The main issue other than the build quality is the lack of a lock for the usb-c side, i might have a defect in my model but only the standard usb locks in place while the other side tries pushing back in when inserting it into a device. Overall not a bad buy if on sale. Storage capacity is 32gb which is okay. Though when a carrying in the bag the sliding button can be pushed and usb end will pop out. Would prefer with the cover instead of button. Very useful and easy to use the quality of the product is solid the USB port connects and function as should same as the USB C port with my phone. And the sliding mechanism is well done too. Good product but no working with Google pixel 2xl hence no use for me very fast for the USB C transfer, however, it can run a bit hot. Perfect for portability and easy to use. Is not functions well, not easy to operate I was hoping to use this for my Mac book pro 15 inch but I quickly found that it does not fit and I had to use a usb-c/thunderbolt to usb-a adapter anyways. Still a really good and reliable storage device and for the price I would recommend it to anyone. just a heads up won't fit otterbox case on my note 9 had to order extension. I have owned this for a few months.. and it gets REALLY HOT. In turn, it makes my computer really hot. I mean hot to touch. Dangerous. Awful. Trash. It's get heated after using for 5 to 10 minutes Something is wrong with this product.  My Microsoft Surface Book 2 transfers 30GB of data to my current USB flash drive  in about 22 minutes.  Backing up to this SanDisk Dual Drive USB Type-C took over 1 hour and 7 minutes, more than 3 times as long!!  It doesn't matter if the type C connector or regular USB connector side is used.  On-line recommendations for speeding up transfer did not work.  If you need a fast transfer speed, do not buy this product. Any time I plug this in to read or write files, it gets REALLY hot really quickly.  Not just warm, but HOT.  It doesn't feel right.  I have never had a USB/thumb drive get anywhere near as hot as this gets.Another minor issue is that while the slider ""clicks"" into place when you slide it to the USB-A side, there is no similar locks-in-place feature for when it slides to the USB-C side.It is definitely small - almost too small - and a bit fragile feeling.  I'd like something more substantial to grip when inserting/removing it so that I don't feel like I'm going to break it.Otherwise, the capacity is adequate and the versatility is nice. It gets really hot when in use. Overall the Dual Drive is an okay flash drive. It's cheap for the space, and read performance is great. However don't expect write performance to match up to the likes of SanDisk's Extreme products.Read: Consistently 150-160MB/secWrite: Peaks at 90MB/sec before stabilizing at 25MB/secThe drive meets or exceeds SanDisk's rated read performance. They don't advertise the write performance of the drive, so I can't knock them for it. Just know that it's only capable of writing quickly in short bursts. I suspect the drive is encountering thermal throttling after writing at full speed for more than 20 seconds or so, which is to be expected on a drive this physically small. After that point, it levels out at 25MB/sec or so. It'll take about 35 minutes to fill a 64GB drive with writes.The dual drive mechanism is much improved over SanDisk's previous take on the concept,¬†

SanDisk 32GB Flash Drive for Type-C (SDDDC-032G-G46)

  , which left one end exposed at all times. The slider mechanism will keep both ends protected when its not in use, which should make the drive more durable. The slider itself is a bit simple and I'm not wholly convinced that it'll last forever, but it does the job.Overall, being able to move files between my MacBook and my desktop via a single USB flash drive (and without any adapter) has proven to be very useful, and this is one of the few drives on the market that can do that. Just don't expect Extreme performance from this mid-range drive. Reads and write reasonably, not so super fast but manageable. It has both normal usb and usbc connector, solves many issues, works well for, product is made in Malaysia. Gets Heated This thing gets hot after being plugged in for like 30 seconds--it is ridiculous! File write speeds are pretty slow, and I think that it may be due to the hardware getting so hot that it throttles performance. All in all, a decent device, but kinda defeats the purpose of being a physically small drive that hugely boosts my laptop's storage when it is like a hot coal on my desk. I copied a 10+ GB file to this drive connected to my PC using type C. I got about 30 MB/s write speed in the first few minutes. Then the write speed took several steps down, first to 27 MB/s, and eventually stabilized at around 20 MB/s. As others have said, it got very hot at the end - maybe it's some kind of thermal throttling? I had very high expectation for the drive in the beginning, and now it seems it's no different from those brandless drives that you can get elsewhere. bought this for my new mac which doesnt have a usb and i use to print at work,.easy to use and stores a lot This thing is awful. Read speeds are not bad but right speed for any file larger than a couple hundred megabytes is painfully slow. Also, the button that slides to extend either side of the drive won't click into place so it slides freely and is appearing to be either broken or just poor design quality. Wish I had tested this before the return. Was up as I would have definitely returned it. Save your money and buy something else. if you are buying it for the USB-C functionality you are better off getting a regular flash drive with a USB c to USB-A female adapter so that you can plug in a regular USB-A flash drive. good product The USB 3.1 speeds on this are very nice, as well as the convenience of moving files between my MBP and my desktop that only has USB A ports. One thing to note is it gets very warm though. The drive itself is very small, and it seems like its using the metal body as a heat sink. Even when not transferring data, it can get warm. When moving a few GB, it can get uncomfortably hot. Write performance is terrible, and sometimes slower than older USB 2.0 flash drives.Drive also at some point became stuck as read-only, which I haven't been able to fix -- looks like it's destined for the bin. The force needed to insert the USB-C side of this drive into a MacBook Pro Thunderbolt port causes the connector to slide back into the case.  Even applying pressure to the slide mechanism while inserting does not help.  I had to completely remove the case from the drive in order to be able to use it.  Now it has no longer has the structural support, dust protection, durability, etc that the case provides.  It is now relegated to at-home file transfer use as I would not feel safe throwing it in bag and taking it on the go.  Otherwise, it functions great to transfer files and use between USB 3.1 and USB-C devices. It get hot during sharing files This is a perfect product to plug into a laptop and then use the type C when connected to a phone.  I had a problem plugging the type C end into my phone when the phone had a case.  If the product had a longer C connector it might work better with phones that have cases.  The second issue is that it is extremely hard to connect a lanyard to this product through the extremely small holes provided. If you have a newer MacBook but also have older devices at home or work, you know you need either a USB adaptor or a dual port USB drive. This drive has the working parts sitting in a housing that you have to slide with a tab on the side, so that only one or the other port (USB-A or USB-C) is usable at a time.  I have run into two problems; first, pocket lint, sand or other grit from your pockets or backpack can get in the housing, making it hard to slide. Second, you really have to keep your finger hard on the slide tab when pushing the drive into a device, otherwise the part will slide back into the housing instead of fully seating itself into the device.  Next time I need drives, I will look for ones that don't have a sliding mechanism. I have waited years for something like this. It is perfect and makes transferring on the go very easy. I can trade files with family during visits across different operating systems and device types. 100% recommend Speed In Mobile Very Weak like 5MB/Sec,,,,,Heating Problem Decent USB 3.0 performance.  Misleading description, should not even mention 3.1.

SanDisk Ultra 128GB Dual Drive USB Type-C (SDDDC2-128G-G46)"
76,Saucony Men's Multi-Pack Mesh Ventilating Comfort Fit Performance No-Show Socks,Sports and Outdoors,"These socks are solid, I got them on some kind of sale. Super comfortable. Total bs that they are allowed to come up in the category Its a good cheap sock. Unfortunately the heel slips off. It's too big. It's advertised that it fits size 6 men's. Well let me just tell you right now I'm a size 7 and it's too big! Already have a hole at the top of the toes. It was the first day wearing them. Not going to last‚Ä¶ These socks must be engineered to form a hole after the initial use. I purchased these in December 2019 and already have disposed of them or retorted to using them as shop rags. I now use a dollar chain brand sock, which is a fraction of the cost, and I get more than 1 use. they shrink so much after 1st washing The fit is not correct. Socks slip off when walking Some pairs are bigger than others.It slides off easily. Fits very well and comfortable all day. Just after one wash they slip off my heal. It fitted perfectly at first. Fits fine but came missing a sock. 5.5 pairs... Heal doesn't stay and starts to slip off eventually it bunches up to the middle of the foot Great socks. Very comfortable. Probably my favorite stocks ive bought. Will purchase again. Fit prefectly good One time ues They feel good but run small would. It stay in while working out. A+++++++ The socks started out great, very comfy and soft. However after the second wash two pairs already had holes in the bottom of the soles These are great socks! I purchased the black variety on 10/18/2018 and they're still great socks. They look good, feel good - still totally happy. Bought the gray variety 03/11/2019 and the elastic in the heels of those are starting to slack and look bad and beging to slip off the heel. I'm writing this review because I came looking at replacements and saw the terrible reviews. In my experience so far, sometimes you just get a bad batch or the circumstances line up for a terrible product experience. I'm lucky, mine was good. Going to try the Bolt series next. Title says it all. The toe seam was thick, poorly crafted, and with a tough tag of fabric hanging off the edges. Rubbed perfectly against first and fifth toe causing blisters. Worst socks I've ever owned After wearing Nike socks for years, I purchased the Saucony socks for my husband. My husband loves them. The purchase price was significantly cheaper than the Nike and wash and wear just the same. These will be our go to socks for him from now on. Best sock for comfort for all aspects of life. Have to really stretch them or they slide down in your shoes, but they look pretty good.  Based on the material I don't expect them to last too long, but they were worth the price. great fit This is not a no show sock. Product is great. Just be aware that a 12-pack is twelve individual socks, not pairs of socks. You can't actually purchase a single sock...but evidently you can buy 12 individuals socks. I am so happy to find a larger sock for my husband's size 13 feet.  The fit and color are great.  His only wish is that they had more of a soft, cottony feel. as expected  good fit and comfortable Thicker then I thought but I‚Äôm not upset by it. I liked these socks Soft and comfortable but 1 pair seemed to be a little thinner and got a hold immediately. Finally a comfortable good fitting sneaker sock!  nuff said Ventilation is great The product was fairly cheap, but you get what you pay for, poorly made goods that won't last more than a few months. I bought the socks at the end of September and by December they have all started splitting open in the heal and holes have opened in the toe. I do not wear these daily, but I still use them for occasional athletic and causal wear. I have never owned a pair of socks that have deteriorated so quickly without cause as much as these have.Overall, I recommend them if you want something semi-comfortable and inexpensive. Expect to end up paying more in the future as you're going to need a quick replacement. Take my advice and buy something that will actually last. You'll save time and money in the long run. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about these socks is the toe seam. The socks were fine at first but within 6 months the elastic was ruined in all pairs and they don't stay in place. Ankle opening all misshapen and the slide down into my shoes and bunch up around the arches of my feet. Didn't last long at all. I have other pairs that are different brands that I've had for years that hold up much better. I'll stick with those brands. too small Great socks. I use them for running. Very comfortable. XL size is awesome for my size 13 feet These socks won‚Äôt even stay up around ankles. They immediately start slipping towards your heal. Usually takes socks a while before the band starts to fail and loosens. These do it right out the gate. Terrible Although these are super soft and cushy, they do not come up far enough at the heel to prevent rubbing while wearing size 10 running shoes like ASICS or Hokas. That was a bummer to find out mid run. Great fitting socks. The stay in place well and are great for running. They seemed too big in the packaging but fit snug and are very comfortable They are great socks. They still show a bit, but they don't with my high tops! They do get some pilling after a couple washes. That's why I gave it 4 starts. I find them comfortable and they don't slide down, except for when I take my shoes off, which isn't a big deal and to be expected. Cheaply made. Fell apart after a couple uses Those socks which I bought ca. 10 years ago, are much better quality, because there were less elastic in them, and they were not slippery on parkett / laminated surface.Unfortunately this new manufacturing use something material from which I need to be careful, and no jumps in the socks or big steps.In the meantime, the comfort is very good, it can bbear 2-3 times training, so the breathing is also good for foot, and the toe part is also very well created.It is good for everyday life also, but I prefer it to training in running shoe, gym shoe, cycling shoe. Not bad Good, durable socks. Material is cheaply made and sewing / stitching looks like it was sewn in a prison factory!  Sizes are running for little Chinese feet.  First time i put my foot in the sock and tried to pull it over my reel, I felt it rip apart a bit.  Closer examination shows stitching failing along the seams. Supposed to for men 13-15 my mom wears a size 7 they are way small for her even Not well put together but for the price they are still a deal. Thin My husband loves these socks.  Finally, socks he isn't cramming his size 13 feet into. I returned these because they didn‚Äôt really provide a lot of grip, and seemed to be a lot bulkier and fluffy vs compression-focused. They felt like cotton socks to me, and not made for running. They are comfortable, but they are *NOT* ‚Äúno-show‚Äù socks. Will keep them as athletic socks, because I‚Äôm too lazy to return a package of socks in the mail, but unfortunately these are not what I thought they would be. Fit is good, not a running sock. They seem to wear down pretty quick. But I like them Fairly good quality and at this price I can order at least twice a year or more. They are not no show socks Not 1 size fits all!  advertised to fit size 12, really have to stretch the sock, then it's barely on! Was disappointed with fit! These are not even close to being ""No Show"" socks. They are easily seen wearing any shoe. So after wearing and washing these socks ONE TIME, they began coming apart.  The seam at the toes began to tear apart.  After the second wearing and washing, some of the pairs had holes in the seams.Definitely NOT what I expected! So hard to find size16-ish. These are nicely sized but for some reason they do not stay in place and like to work themselves off fast. Too thin and short. Fit well These are nice socks but they keep sliding off the heel of my feet when wearing shoes. It's pretty obnoxious.However, I'm a size 11.5 and I bought the 8-12s. Possibly this wouldn't happen if one got them a size too big. Great fit! Bought size 13-15. They are small for me with 13 wide feet. Would not recommend for people with size 14 or 15. I had high hopes, but I am disappointed with the tight fit, and difficulty getting them on. First of all I buy Sacony shoes all the time for running. They are great.  The socks they make, not so much.  I am a size 10 and the socks slide right off my feet. They supposively fit between sizes 9.5 and 11.5. I would not buy the socks unless you're size is at least 11. Doesn‚Äôt stay on the heel.  Very thin material.  Do not recommend as an athletic sock Perfit fit!! Comfortable but they make your feet SWEAT be prepared for that They‚Äôre okay. Nothing bad, it good, just meh. Would buy again if I needed cheap socks. These socks were too small out of the box and shrunk even further in the wash.  I gave them to my kids. Is lower on my ankle than expected and can only wear lower shoes with them. great quality socks but the sizing is wrong.  page says its fits up to size 12 package says 11.5.  im a 12 and the tocks where a lottle to small and kept sliding down had to return I ordered this socks just a couple days ago and wore a couple pairs once, once I wash them and put them back on and they already have holes in them. Feels like these want to slip off my heel. Don‚Äôt stay on like I would want. Nice color and fit but runs a bit big My husband likes these socks. The heels don't stay up. They won‚Äôt stay up when exercising.  Don‚Äôt waste your money! Very comfortable. Seems well made but grossly undersized. Way smaller than size advertised. I'm picky about my socks.  I wear size 10.5 shoes and these socks are a little big.  The heel always runs up a bit towards my ankle when I put on shoes.I wish socks in general were made to fit betterOther than the fit, the socks are great.  Super comfortable, soft, feels a bit thick but still breathable.  Good for working out or runs of under 45 minutes.  Anything longer and it starts to get a bit warm/humid. The socks work as ankle socks but I got them based on their claim that they are no show socks. I was disappointed to find that if anything they show more than some of my other socks. Socks are tight for the advertised size. But otherwise ok. Good sock. I ordered size 8-9, however, the heel of the socks are actually very visible. When they arrived, the band they were wrapped in was marked L.  Anyone who orders these needs to think small. Just like most reviews say the ball up get a lot of stuff after first wash. Other than that do a great job of being socks. I'm shoe size 11.  Therefore, the manufacturer's size 13-15 should have been plenty big for me, more so when the product is labeled and sold as true to size.  Wrong!  This product should be sold as small, medium, and large. I bought these after enjoying the performance series Saucony socks (black).  The grey ones feel very loose at the ankle and I can foresee them slipping down into my shoe after a couple washes. They tend to slip off your foot while wearing them. And no I didn't order them to small. I really like these socks. Decent product. Good for lifting or regular use. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for running, too thin. Very comfortable.  Only worn once. Supper thin tho, cant see them lasting long When we bought these they fit perfectly,  I ordered another set, then I washed them. My son has very large feet, now the sock won't go over his heels. I try to wear the socks and within minutes I walk out of them their useless to me. The listing says that these socks don't slip.  They do and I returned them. Got these socks for the upcoming cross country season. Thus far they have been great running socks. Comfortable and most importantly do not bunch up while running. I have worn the socks 3 times, all first time wearing so they are not stretched out or over washed. They slip off my feet, in my shoes. This is during a workout on an elliptical, bike and weight training. I cant imagine if I was running in them. Very poor product, I thought this was a good brand but my guess is they just licensed it out to someone producing cheap crap. Wish I had not wasted my money on these. Decent prize decent product I'm a size 10 in men's, and it fit tight and to small. I'll probably give the socks to my daughter. She has a smaller foot. I got these because they are no show and looked really comfortable.  I got them, I‚Äôve worn them quite a bit and they are more comfortable than I thought they‚Äôd be!  However, they shrank on the first wash and I have to keep pulling them back into my feet. These socks weren‚Äôt bad. Fit about right for size 11 and have good cushioning. For the price you could do way worse. Very comfortable socks second time I purchased product.  I‚Äôm tough on my socks and these last for long time. If you order be sure to get the next size up because they don‚Äôt run true to size. Was going to return but too much trouble. Will try to find someone else to give to Most comfortable socks I have ever owned! Orders the size 8-12. I wear a size 9 shoe and these socks are huge on my feet. The labeling on the socks say size Large. If you wear a size 11 or 12 shoe, I am sure these will be fine, but for a smaller foot they go up past your ankles. The toe area does not feel the greatest. The stitching is very big. Trired to purchase high quality black althelic footies for my husband -size 12 shoe. They fit and fabric was nice until we washed them, in cold water, and medium dryer heat. If they came larger in XXL shoe/foot size I would order them. If your shoe size for a man is smaller (size 10 or less) they may work for you. Wish we could return them for refund. regular old socks, nothing special Comfortable socks.  As of today my favorite pair of socks. these are okay, I think they are a little expensive for the quality These are good running socks at a good price. They are reasonably cushioned but still breathe well. Have had no issues with slipping or bunching. They are holding up well no signs of wearing after many runs. I never write reviews, but these socks are so crappy I needed to warn anyone looking to buy these.If you want socks that will fall off the moment you start walking these are the socks for you. The ankle portion is super loose and render them useless. Too thick for me for summer wear and they run a bit small. Can‚Äôt complain. Nothing crazy but not bad either. Definitely good for the price When I first got these socks I was happy as my kids have been taking my socks, and no one else has this style.After about a week of wearing them, I put a sock on after getting it out of the dryer and the heel ripped open as I was putting on the sock. This has happened two more times so far. Most of the socks seem stronger, but about half feel like they got really thin in spots especially around the heel.I need my socks to last much longer. I like thicker socks because l don‚Äôt like to walk around barefoot. Not great quality but it will do until l can buy in person. THESE ARE NOT NO SHOW SOCKS. THEY WERE CLEARLY VISIBLE ABOVE THE LOW CUT ATHLETIC SHOES I WEAR WHEN WORKING OUT. Well made but aren't total no-show Given Saucony‚Äôs name is on these socks, I was expecting better quality. They slide down on your heels and have a generally loose feel. After 3 months they've lost elasticity and don't stay on your feet when wearing shoes. They do not fit the girth of the foot.  These are for long thin feet.  They acted like compression socks which nearly shut off the circulation in my foot.  I gave them to my nephew who has long skinny feet.  Nearly impossible to find socks that fit large feet. Maybe because I got the largest size, but the fit is strange. Not really noticable when you have your shoes on, but when you put them on and take them off, or if you are wearing them around the house, kept wanting to adjust them. Never quite right. too hot for Miami! Pros - good price and comfortableCons:  Won't stay on my feet.  I am a size 11.5 and after about 3 months the started sliding off my heels while wearing them in running shoes...which became a nuisance over time.  This is the first time I have had this issue with the low-cut socks (having had many different brands over the past several years).I would not buy them again and do not recommend them to others. They're well vented, but fall apart very easily. The socks slip off. I had to return them. The fit Poor quality and after first washing, hokes appear across top stitching.  Thought the first pair may have been flawed and ordered a second pair, and have experienced the same issue.  Socks stitching is falling apart and holes develop after wearing them once! Waste of money! Good stock Ordered socks for my usual shoe size, and they were too small. This caused them to run down which was uncomfortable when walking or exercising. Fits a size 15 foot perfectly. Washes well. I liked them so much, I bought more. Im a size 10 and it fits lose from the heel. Other than that I like the socks this is great for walking in theme parks comfortable to wear with driving shoes Comfortable but a little small.  Rides down on my heel.  I'm size 11."
77,"Schick Hydro Silk Touch-Up Multipurpose Exfoliating Dermaplaning Tool, Eyebrow Razor, and Facial Razor with Precision Cover, 3 Count (Packaging May Vary)",Beauty and Personal Care,"I'm in love with this product and it works super well for how I use it. It's not very good for shaving off peach fuzz because it seems to not be sharp enough and it just can't pick the fuzz up and off of the face (at least for me). However, it's so amazing for (I'm sorry I have to say it) hairy faces. I shave my face once a week and the results are great. My face looks smoother and less dark and hairy looking. Shaving my face does make it really dry after because of how long I go without moisturizer (I have dry skin).This isn't supposed to be moisturizing and I really wouldn't recommend this for sensitive skin. Dermaplaining, in general, is quite harsh and I don't exactly use this product for what it's mainly for. When using this, you should be very careful as it is easy to overdo the shaving and irritate your skin a lot (it's not comfortable but for me, it's lasted for only around a day or two). You can also end up cutting yourself badly, of course. I've never done that, though. I bought these well because they're cute ü§£. I actually used one on my cats that had matted fur, worked great and was quick so he wasn't so irritated with me messing with his fur! Not sure if I received a very dull set or the razors are just not that good as everyone say they are. I tried all three razors and none of them were sharp enough to remove any hair off my face. I tried wetting my face, nothing. I don‚Äôt recommend. Really handy They cleaned up all my peach fuss but it scratched and cut my face These work really well but seem to dull after a couple uses. Great product. However, ordered 2 packs and only received 1. Edit:I ended up purchasing the flawless razor my clients raved about but was severely disappointed by its performance. I followed the instructions to a tee, replaced the battery, still didn‚Äôt get the hairs. So I‚Äôm altering my review & adding a star because these are cheaper & did a closer shave.Original:I bought this product hoping for a razor that is smaller for smaller areas to shave, such as between my eyebrows, as well as hoping for a closer shave on those pesky dark hairs on my chin (thank you kindly to my 2 children & hitting my 30s for contributing). While it is smaller, it kind of stops there. When I use it to shave my face, it tears up my skin - not in a good way. As a medical aesthetician, I would not recommend using this for dermaplaning, as I'm quite certain this is actively causing more damage. A few of my clients have recently mentioned using the Nu Flawless razor to get a closer shave between laser hair removal treatments, so I would recommend looking into that instead. It might cost more, but from what I have observed with my clients, it is worth the money. It‚Äôs such easy to hard and great for my sensitive skin! I was honestly really hesitant to shave my face with this but it doesn‚Äôt make my hair come back any darker and it saves off all the dry skin! You have to be really careful so you don‚Äôt cut your face but it‚Äôs easy to get the hang of The razor is good for dermaplaning, you can get a few uses out of them before they dull. The end of the razor is very sharp and you can easily nick yourself. The tip is sharper than the rest of the razor so be careful and don't hold it flat against your skin. I would probably try another brand before I bought this one again. I shave my peach fuzz using aloegel as the medium and this razor gives a smooth finish in one go. I don't agree with the package claims at all. They do remove hair, but certainly not in an 'easy to use' way. I typically don't have sensitive skin but using this razor left me dried out scraped up for the most part. It certainly is possible that these could work as described... Though I'm not about to try them again to find out. Not worth the scrapes. It does it's work. It didn't feel great. It feels weird to hold especially around the nose area.. may be the blade is kinda big!! THIS PRODUCT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME!  GOING BACK TO MY BATTERY HAIR REMOVAL.  IT IS FASTER, AND DOESN'T PULL ON SKIN! I use this to give my beard a fresh lineup. Works like a charm. After reading all the reviews and watching YouTube videos on this product, I decided to give it a try. I shaved my face the recommended way and unfortunately the hair in certain places did grow back thicker.It is a handy tool and easy, I just wish I didn't use it because now I have to get the hair waxed multiple times to get it to grow back thinner and softer. Every woman's hair and body are different so I am not too surprised my hair grew back thicker than other women's.Won't be purchasing again. This did not work well for me at all. Ended up giving the other two away. Works great, easy to hold shames well. One of the products broke while I was using it. Does not work I think this is a case of ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù. I‚Äôve used two of the three tools in this pack and I‚Äôll use the third but won‚Äôt be purchasing again. They do remove most of the peach fuzz on my face and are decent at shaping brows but holy moly the irritation is extreme. Lots of burning when I‚Äôm done and some redness. Too bulky to hold, the design makes it difficult to shape eyebrows. Not for sensitive skin plus the skin in eyebrow area is delicate. For me I felt they were too risky for continued use. Do not recommend. i usually buy twink kind but i read that these work so much better? i am a dark hair female who is hairy. i was so scared to initially use these bc i didn‚Äôt want a beard or look like i ‚Äúshave‚Äù my face. i didn‚Äôt want my face to look like my legs ... you know what i mean. def doesn‚Äôt make the hairs on your face come back thick or intense however i do not agree these are better. i think they‚Äôre worse. they kinda scratch my face. my face didn‚Äôt feel smoother either. i would recommend buying the twinklers. they work much better especially if you‚Äôre more hairy like myself. i would buy these again if i couldn‚Äôt find anything else but other than that... no. They are okay. Not my favorite Product works as promised, very easy to use. Worth the price. They need an edge guard, totally cut my face with the end holding it as directed with the tip. Super easy to use and faster!! No roughness or swollen skin after using it. Easy to shape eye brows and shave face. Serves purpose I tried to love them but they didn‚Äôt seem to work well with me. I have super fine hair so maybe I just need something sharper?? Great concept but didn‚Äôt work! These were awful for me. Left red scratches on my skin and did not always take the hair. Terrible for sensitive skin. I hadn't seen these in years, glad to find them again. Like having on hand for quick use when needed. My product was broken... the razors are broken off These are great, you don‚Äôt need the most popular or expensive tool! These work very well! Yes, as all of them‚Ä¶.SHARP! I damaged the skin on my cheeks- they were red for weeks.  A handy tool but be very careful how and where you use it. These work great in a pinch to remove the peach fuzz from your face. They are easy to use and do a great job. Unfortunately they don‚Äôt last long and the blade typically falls off before it gets too dull to use. Luckily they are cheap and not meant to last forever. So smooth and easy to use Not so good on course hairs. These work well but so do disposable razors. Not very good at getting rid of peach fuzz as much as other razors I‚Äôve used. I have to go over areas several times with a lot of pressure and have cut myself while doing so. It worked VERY WELL to the point I accidently cut my eyebrow with 1 sec mistake.It works very well. Trust me. I got half of one brow gone in a blink... This knife is not for dermaplaning as they are not sharp at I was expecting, but work to remove all the hair on your face. Don't use on a rush to avoid cuts, on front of a mirror, with heavy light and seated is better.  Take a hot shower, scrub your face and use. Really good product and super easy to use Useless.  Removed nothing. Works amazing! This is the first time I bought this brand. I was pretty disappointed! They don‚Äôt do a good job, and I had to go over & over to get the smooth feeling that I like. I‚Äôm going back to the first brand I bought. Bought this to self derma blade my face/neck fuzzies.  Was NOT satisfied with results.  Instead I bought a pack of the BIC SINGLE BLADE razors which work GREAT at much less the cost. It works for dead skin, but hasn‚Äôt worked with facial hair. I would mainly use it for dead skin. These are easy to hold and don‚Äôt cut if used properly It was easy to use but very rough on my sensitive skin. It got rid of some of my peach fuzz but it did not shave very closely. I also used for eye brows it was okay. Good. Sharp. Easy Great product! My teenage daughter loves them. I‚Äôm shocked at how well this works on fine facial hair! I‚Äôve paid a lot of money for fancy gadgets that come with monthly subscription plans for replacement blades and this cheap fix blows them out of the water. A must have for easy grooming!!! Best decision you‚Äôll ever make! Product received was not Schick. I decided to test the razor anyway - but it did not remove any hair whatsoever. Total waste. I was debating buying these for quite a while, but finally grabbed them when I saw a really great deal. I‚Äôm glad I did! I was afraid that I‚Äôd cut myself up, but these things are kind of serrated in a way that the sharp parts are perpendicular to the actual edge. It‚Äôs a fail-safe for the extra clumsy (like me). I use them everyday and have even tidied up my kids‚Äô brows with no injuries yet. So far I‚Äôm still using my first one, but it‚Äôs nice that they come in a multi-pack now that my beauty routine can‚Äôt survive without them. This product is super easy to use and great for what its intended to do trim or get rid of little hairs. My only issue is that you need to be a bit careful its much sharper than it looks and will irritate a tiny bit without you even noticing it. Overall good product and priceüëç Not as sharp as others ones I have used and they break easily, but it gets the job done for the time being. Love these. Smooth. If used correctly they‚Äôre great. Any negative reviews about these I feel is lack of knowledge on dermaplaning I decided to try this product after seeing some youtube videos, and I am pleased with the results it gives me.  I hate plucking my eyebrows...don't get them waxed because that's just too painful for me.  I also use these for the peach fuzz on my face (again after watch some videos) and I like how my skin feels.  I would recommend them.  It takes a little trial and error at first to get the hang of it, but they are easy to use. Easy and cheap Much darker than advertised I‚Äôm used to getting dermaplaning done with a surgical scalpel by an esthetician and this doesn‚Äôt really come close. The blade doesn‚Äôt get that close to get all peach fuzz off and also feels scratchy Will reorder Works really well even on my super sensitive skin. I‚Äôve even used it on my arms and it works great. I do feel like after just 4-5 uses I could tell it started to dull because it felt a little more rough on my skin. Overall I will still continue to use it Work great at first use. Then go dull after that. Will not use or buy again Works well.Makes face a little itchy after using. Great tool for a dermaplane. Easy to use.  Read the directions so you don't use chemicals that cause sensitivity afterwards. Terrible. Not sharp, had to keep going back over. Ended up plucking. pretty self explanatory. This item is just fair. it is not any better than a razor. Bad quality razor, cuts your skin very easily. Immediate razor rash, on my cheeks and temples  with nicks, üòî handles well. Great for eyebrows. üòä. Each one had a piece of plastic that cut my skin Poor quality broke after 2 uses. These are easy to hold and use. However, they are not smooth and tend to pull at the hair and scrape. I was expecting a smoother glide over the skin. It did work but was not very comfortable. I have sensitive skin and my skin was slightly irritated after use. I love to use these for my face, so sharp and easy to use. I have not experienced any breakouts using these razors for dermaplaning. Works great leaves skin smooth only wish I could get more uses out of each one I was disappointed in these. They don‚Äôt appear to be as sharp as some brands I‚Äôve used in the past. The hair on my face doesn‚Äôt come off easily, it almost feels like it gets caught on the blades. It should work smoother. They probably work okay for small areas, but not much for the whole face if you want to remove the peach fuzz. Sorry to say, ladies, but save your money. This did not do a thing, and I have fair skin and very light hair on my face. Nevertheless, I thought it might take off the little fuzz I have so my skin care products would penetrate better. Nada, nothing, no impact. Don‚Äôt bother ‚òπÔ∏è I dunno, the things were pretty much worthless. I kind of expected them to work as a mini razor ~ didn't happen.  they scrape and drag across your skin, and in sensitive areas? ugh.don't buy unless you have no other choices. I have been dermaplaning for about a year and have only used another, more expensive brand of razor so when I saw these razors were half the price, I ordered them. Not all razors are the same, Ladies. These aren‚Äôt near the quality of my normal razor and it‚Äôs is extremely easy to cut yourself with. One razor had a tiny metal burr on the end and I had a centimeter cut from it on my cheek. They are very rough on your face as well, it get like rubbing sandpaper against my skin. I would not recommend. Find something of better quality. Good quality for the price and works fine. However, after a couple weeks of sporadic use, I started noticing the fine little hairs on my upper lip were growing in darker and courser than previously, so I switched back to at-home waxing strips. For the price point, though, these are worth seeing if they work for you. I tried to use this and each time, each angle of the blade, and every attempt it scratched my skin. No dermaplaning at all. Painful to use on skin This is a great product. I use it to shave my head. It‚Äôs light and easy to use. It does not cut my skin. I would give it 5 stars but one of my razors were broken in half. Works very well, easy to cut yourself so pull skin tight, take your time and do each area once. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve gone my whole life without these. I use them for my face, legs, etc and I‚Äôm in love. These are super easy to use to clean up peach fuzz and fine hairs around the edges of my eyebrows. It is really easy to control and target exactly what hair I want to remove. My skin does feel a little rough afterwards, but I just wash and moisturize and it's back to normal. I have tried a few different brands that have totally sucked. They drag, or are too dull, last 1-2 uses, etc.. but these are great & super effective but sharp af! I would definitely recommend, but proceed with caution.Side note: I have very sensitive skin & I almost always have irritation after using a razor of any kind, but these don't irritate me at all! I love these little razors but this brand seemed alot duller and did not last as long as others. I saw all the good reviews and really wanted to try this for my peach fuzz facial hair. As a woman with dark hair, I do get peach fuzz above my top lip that is noticeable and that I hate. I use to use the digital one that is like a men's shaver for it but it would give me little pimples so I wanted a gentler and better approach. I bought these because I thought it would work but it didn't at all. It was so hard to shave my eyebrows as well as my upper lip These are so perfect Get these now if you are over 40! Lol no joke. I can‚Äôt use chemical peelers or exfoliants because my skin is so sensitive. These give you that fresh skin without the burn. I love using this product for a quick cleanup job.  I use it to remove peach fuzz and to shape my eyebrows when I don't have time to get them waxed.  Definitely, a must-have for all the ladies. i tried to use these when i got them, i was all thumbs.  luckily nothing was injured.  learned my lesson, not worth the money It dint work for me. Doesnt do anything These were bigger than the usual ones I buy... not the best for eye brows but I guess would work if your using it on bigger areas? Didn‚Äôt work as expected Great razor!! Does the job. Great price It does ok job but the price went up by $2 seriously!!! Try a diff razor with cheaper price Broke on second use Not for sensitive skin. Easy to use but create rashes for sensitive skin Like any human I get a little peach fuzz on my face. It‚Äôs normal and perfectly natural. But for personal interest I got this to help remove the peach fuzziness and the dead skin that accumulates on ones face because I have more of an oily skin type. These worked great for that. Real Easton use and easy to clean, no nicks or razor burns if that‚Äôs a concern for anyone. I also have very sensitive skin and these worked well This is an okay purchase. Make sure to dispose properly I love these!! I definitely recommend them! This product does not work at all You're better off just using a regular razor. I seriously hope I‚Äôm my face is not scarred for life.  These are terrible. These rust if left in shower. I like regular razor that can be left on a shelf It‚Äôs ok. Not that Great. Hard to skin I have the world's most sensitive, 60-plus year old skin. This well great IF you hold it very lightly, barely whisping over the surface of the skin. The burns shown in product review photos are the result of too much pressure in use. Don't apply the same pressure as with a razor. 100% pleased with the product. the covers for the blade part of it are plastic and easily slide off Cuts you!! It removes the hair but left my face bleeding and with scratches. Not very durable or easy to hold. Rather cheap and flimsy plastic. Must cover same area on face or body multiple times If you are looking at this product because you have acne scars, or hormonal acne and want a clear face DO NOT DO IT! I used this once and it cause every peach fuzz to grow back like an ingrown hair. Worst breakout of my life, and it‚Äôs been months and it‚Äôs still healing. By far the worst product I ever purchased from Amazon. Horrible quality- will cut your skin. just got the littke fine hairs. Not good quality does not shave the face properly. Using a normal razor does a better job. Gave me really bad ingrown hairs above my lip and on my chin Amazing. Be careful they are super sharp obviously but you definitely dont want to take off half an eye brow. blades are dull and doesn't do a good job I love these little razors. Compact and easy to store and travel with. For years I used the creams and got rashes and redness. I always heard that women shouldn't shave their faces. Wrong! The hair does not grow back faster and thicker. With these razors my makeup looks better. The also exfoliate and make my skin look and feel softer. Wish I knew about this a long time ago. A regular razor is better. They last they work good price I have used multiple brands of personal razors like this over the last few years and so when it was time to order new ones, I decided to give this brand a try. I used the first out of the package this morning in the shower and on the second swipe along the side of my face (side burn area), I cut myself. Not a scratch, but a true cut an inch or so long that bled for several minutes. I was using the razor the same way I have always done, but this one has a very sharp leading edge that i was not expecting and do not feel is safe for use on the face. These will be going in the trash! Super easy to use and gets the job done."
78,Seagate BarraCuda 2TB Internal Hard Drive HDD ‚Äì 3.5 Inch SATA 6Gb/s 7200 RPM 256MB Cache 3.5-Inch ‚Äì Frustration Free Packaging (ST2000DM008/ST2000DMZ08),Computers,"Good product, however there was no mounting hardware, no cables, no installation software or quick start checklist.  Just a sealed static bag disk in a box.If you have all the wires and mounting hardware, and know how to properly set up the disk once installed you're Golden.  If not look elsewhere. Worse experience I ever had installing a hdd . It doesn't look like the one in the picture, I bought it for a laptop and when I got it it didn't even fit in my PC. And also it doesn't work, it gives hardware errors when trying to set it up. 1.81TB but we all know that whatever storage that is advertised is not the exact storage that you will receive. Barely notice any noise at all but I always have my headsets on. Works, does what it is supposed to and installation is as easy as sliding it into the slot and plugging in the power It shows 2gb not 2TB. I spent so many times to fix it.. Finally I give up to fix it. Just Returned it. Works well for our surveillance system. I was really excited to get this to expand my storage capacity but I ran into some issues. For starters, the package was delivered with a slight bump on the package (not sure if that's due to the seller or Amazon itself). Secondly, I haven't really had any success installing the product. I've been working on it for a while but not really sure how the whole thing is supposed to fit in place... the directions weren't the most helpful. All in all most of the issues that I've had are because I don't really know how to work the product but I wouldn't have minded some more clarification/help in the instructions. As mentioned in other reviews, the speeds which this SSD card goes up to is 5,400 RPM, which is not the 72000 brand. These brand of SSD chips are also like long RAM chips, they are not the traditional SSD drives that came out for the bigger and thicker, laptop models. It is thin and light.I had this product installed by Geek-Squad since I am not a hardware specialist, and it has been tested to work with Windows 10 USB boot-up. This is a crucial step because if there are any problems with accepting the USB boot you won't be able to install the OS of your choice (could try with an external CD or internal CD if the machine is old but no guarantee that will work).The 1TB is actually 930 GB after a clean installation of Windows 10 with H2 edition. Plenty of space to use for MMO or heavy 3D applications such as Auto-Desk Maya. I've ran that in the background along with a movie, and a MMO and it seems to keep up with the pace without noticeable lag (with a 16GB RAM card).So far the SSD is working and I am currently satisfied with the purchase. I will be reviewing this in a month from now if there have been any changes or problems encountered. I ordered it assuming it had a cable but silly me never assume Had a couple issues with my pc not recognizing it after shut down. Hasn't happened for a while now though. So the hard drive showed up and I was expecting a box with sata cables. The hard drive came with an anti static sleeve and no cables. So just be prepared to buy sata cables. The first one i got was broken. It made a loud beep the I could hear very very loud clicking and I checked all over for the hard drive but it didn't show up on my pc. I ordered a replacement that I just installed and it works but I don't know for how long. The first one I got didn't exactly inspire confidence in the product but I'm willing to give it 3 stars because the new one works. Amazon however is making the return of the broken one a pain in my ass. I can get about 220MB/s and after formatting there is around 1.8tb the product is fine to work with my laptop, price also reasonable, recommend worth trying! Didn‚Äôt even last 11 months in a leisurely played gaming pc. Yikes Was going to dispose of my old Dell all in one 27‚Äù.Decided to put 16 mb of memory in and a new 2 gb drive. The computer runs better then the day I bought it. Runs quiet and fast.  For a small price, I have a like new computer. The HDD is completely useless if there is no driver installed for it, which is unlike any other HDD I‚Äôve used before. Not only that, you would need to download the driver from a website that they can‚Äôt even keep up. 502 Bad Gateway all day, can‚Äôt use this device I just received because of no fault of my own, but because this company can‚Äôt optimize their products and can‚Äôt even keep their company website up, even though the products they sell revolve around computers. I wish they didn‚Äôt have a monopoly on this market, because this is trash. I can't say much other then it works and it will take some time until I need to upgrade again My son recently built his computer so he likes displaying the boxes of all the parts in his machine on his shelf. Unfortunately, this version of the drive comes in a plain box unlike the retail version in stores. Other than that, seems to be working great, which is more important - but for same price, he would have purchased it from the store to get the retail box. Normally I don't give a bad review from an incorrect item or shipping damage because it is generally not Amazon's fault.  However, in this case, it IS Amazon's fault.  The unit description is for a 3 1/2 "" 7200 rpm SATA internal drive.  The drive received is NOT an SATA drive.  The fact that my free Prime next day shipping actually takes 1 to 2 weeks is also a bit frustrating.  SIGH. Wish that it came with the mounting screws. I'm sure it works like a dream however, I didn't get a chance to use it. I liked the price to storage that this gave. Fit into my drive bay with no problems, though a sata cable with it would be nice. Drive lasted less than 6 months before crashing. I tried disk repair and optimization software, but couldn't recover anything from it. Amazon won't take the return this long after purchasing, so I went with the warranty through Seagate. Unfortunately, they claim that they do not have this drive in stock, so I'm being send a refurbished ""similar"" hard drive. I've got a WD drive that has lasted several years, so this experience with Seagate will probably be my last. I bought the 8 TB version. Installation was as easy as it could be (know you do have to have your own SATA cable). Literally just plugged it in, formatted it, and assigned it a drive letter in Windows 10 Disk Manager in 5 min. It's a big honkin' drive. I'm happy with it. I can put a ton of big media files on it and I will have them backed up on another device. All good.That said, know what it isn't. It isn't a WD Black. The 1.5 TB WD Black this replaced was my gaming drive for ten years. Even when it failed it told me politely and I was able to get my essential data off it. If you want a fast gaming drive you can depend on for years and years, go for the 4TB WD Black instead (I have one that is three years old and moved all my games to it). This drive is big, slow, and will likely fail in four years if you put any wear on it. Just know what you are buying. I got a 8 tb model. I transferred 1.7 tb for storage. The first 400 gb was fine. But then the copying became slower and slower to about 1/3 of the original rate. The temperature of the disk rose by 3 degree F. This was a great purchase, especially for the price and brand. The only issue is since installing, my computer runs a bit slower and my configurations had to be redone due to some initial issue. I now use it to download all steam games due to the amount of space and if you are looking to upgrade or need more space, I highly recommend it. Bih get your storage with yo ugly ahh lol I wish I could give it a no star... I have bought 3 of there 2tb drives in a row and not a single one worked... Never get Seagate. They are nothing but a scam. If you want to play $150 for 3 paper weights please click order now. If you want something that might actually run. Go get a western digital black. Head my warning. Do Not Buy!! Not very fast compared to today's standard SSDs. I would say it is a bad drive but it does perform as stated. . . which is sub-par for 2021. Drive stopped working after two months. Tried to return back to Amzon but cannot because it more than 30 day. Contact Seagate and was told the drive is out off warranty but drive manufacture date is December 29, 2020. Seagate cannot explain why its expired. I've to provide my purchase receipts to get an RMA. NEVER buy Seagate drive again their support and warranty are suck. Returned twice. Did not work This crappy HDD is too slow to run modern games. Every single game I played no matter what, took long to load and hitched all the time rendering my pc useless in competitive games. I suggest just buying an ssd, after I did that my problems were fixed and everything loaded fast. Everything seems to load slower than with the  hard drive it replaced, even though the same files were probably much more fragmented on the previous drive.  Also  a little noisy. I built my PC during the start of COVID last year around March. I got around to replacing this Hard drive because of the fact that it's pretty much outdated and there are better sources of faster and more reliable storage. Do not go cheap on storage!! I had many problems with my PC because it led me to believe that my PC is just really bad and did not want to be boot anything and it would constantly crash multiple times a day. It was because my HDD kept getting wiped every so often and I would have to re-download yet again. It did it's job, but then again you get for what you pay for. Just spend the extra money on a m.2 ssd and it will be so much faster and reliable! Not mine anymore to slow of a hard drive. I ordered 2 of these HD, one was 1tb, the other 2tb. niether will connect, both wont initialize, getting io error. tried everything. downloaded the wizard, updated the driver, triple checked the connection, tried 3 different connection cables on both HDs, tried both forms of initializing, did various trouble shooting online guides.. all lead to corruption of hd probable diagnosis. wtf... seems others have had these issues as well. seems very strange. noticed the chirping in advance and backed some things up at least Was delivered broken, Tried multiple systems. The only hope that this drive showed was in a dock. Which was cut short with the horrible sounds it made. It does what it says it will. You will have to buy a cord to plug it into your PC unless you already have a that cord. I liked the product, however, this Drive lasted nine months and crashed. I Will not purchase again. Bought 2, and my game library might be too big. Seriously, I love them for the reliable speed of reading and writes. Sure its not the fastest and after a while with continuous downloads, they slow down, but it's worth it I guess. I recommend the Exos if you can cough up the extra money for it. Great in raid if you do video editing. Just needs to be bigger honestly. the capacity that is. I knew this was 5400RPM, but this is a media drive, so I was not too worried about the speed.Makes a bit of clicking when moving large amounts of data, about the same as the old 2TTB WD drive made. Easy to install.  Otherwise it's what it says Got mine, i hope it works well 3 stars for the meantime beeps and clicks a lot. it's SMR.avoid. This had lasted for 3 months and then crashed completely. I sent it it to the manufacturer because it had a warranty. The replacement I got didn‚Äôt even last a day and it crashed. I‚Äôm not to happy with my purchase now. You get what you pay for. Want 2TB with good cache and way too much noise? These are your drives. I bought the 2TB w 256mb cache and they are very noisy when searching, nothing I couldn't live with at first, but I have 2 side by side in the bottom of a Corsair Air case secured in their rubberized mounts and every 10 seconds they chirp like crickets! EVERY..10...SECONDS. The Seagate software you download had my 1TB drives cloned over to these in under 25 minutes each flawlessly but no frickin way can I listen to this noise, every 10 seconds for hours on end. Now I have to secure erase and return, as I have 3 PCs and was going to install 2 in each. It would sound like I was in the middle of the forest at night with all the chirping. Buyer beware! vibration and temperature is very high Package and anti static bag had clearly been opened when we received it. We paid full price for an item that has obviously been returned. Not happy about that. It also had no instructions with it. You get what you pay for. Worked fine the first day and was corrupted by the next day. Doesnt even contain mounting screws. Seems to be working just fine now Worth the money not to cheap or expensive, it's right in the sweet spot. It took over two weeks and when I got it the HD looked like it was used. Tried it and it never worked. Very loud!!!!! Like Got the hard drive i ordered, was in good condition, just wish it came with cables so i could actually hook it up instead of going out to buy cables The mounting brackets on my case aren‚Äôt fully compatible with the sata cable location on this hard drive and this made the installation process fairly complex and difficult. Neither the case product page nor this one mentioned anything about the sata cable placement and any difficulties that would come with this. The Hard drive also has a fairly slow read and write speed. Other than these two complains the hard drive performs as expected and I‚Äôve had no issues that completely stopped me from using the hard drive. The 8TB HDD is very new, out of the box. I've used Seagate hard drives for more than fifteen years and they have been very dependable. I expect the same with this one. I had bad sectors after 3 months. Unfortunate, but it's still running so that's good. Well I installed everything, but my computer won‚Äôt read at all I‚Äôve tried a lot but it won‚Äôt read whenever I try anything , it‚Äôs good just it won‚Äôt work for me so so I bought this drive to be a large game drive. However I didn't realize this drive was 5400 rpm and the crazy amount of data slowness this entailed. I was starting and stopping downloads in steam because it was having to wait on this drive. I'm sure you get more life out of this and everything but it wasn't right for my needs and I didn't realize what I was getting into so I sent it back. I didn't have any problems with it though. Worked perfectly, was easy to install, it was just slow. Super easy to install and the storage capacity is great!! The noise level is super quiet while in operation, but the speed is kind of lack luster, this would go great as a mass storage option but you're probably going to want an SSD to pair with it. Works as expected. Only gave 4 stars because it doesnt come with a data cable Very noisy, can't work near the computer. I've installed it right and I have another hdd's, but this one make noise more then whole computer. It good Used as a storage drive controlled by MS storage spaces. Original 4 year old drives in that same space are still going strong. Received damage but likely from shipping! Likely just needs better packaging. I do have the same product in use still and is a great one as long as it works. I'll admit, I know only what I've watched on YouTube, but I'd have thought that this drive would have at least come with mounting screws, as well as a signal cable so it can power on. I'm sure the drive will work properly, assuming I can get it properly detected by Windows, but for a novice install project, this was quite the bummer to discover that it won't work out of the box. quality ad price This hard drive worked perfectly with the Windows 10 DVD that set my operating system running again. Faulty product. Failed after approx. one year. Corrupted my data several times after redownloading windows and trying again. Seagate used to be a reliable company, sad to see the product quality drop so low. problem with first drive but replacement worked fine. I bought this drive mainly for my backups several months ago without knowing before hand that it's an SMR (shingled magnetic recording) drive. After doing some research I'm aware that this drive uses SMR and may or may not show some SMR issues in the future (there's not enough public performance/lifespan research regarding this technology). Overall it's a decent backup drive to have given the price. The write/read speeds are good and I've not experienced any degradation in performance yet. Another thing to note is that the drive generates more heat than my other 2TB backup drives, possibly due to 7200RPM and higher processing need for SMR. It also makes much more noise when it's operating compared to my other drives, which some times makes me worry a little about the longevity of this drive. For improvements, I'd suggest at least make the nature of this drive (SMR) listed on the Amazon page so that people who are looking for an HDD are aware of this when deciding which one to purchase. The drive itself works as intended and I haven't had any issues with it yet but when I first ordered it I received a dead drive. I returned it and was sent an identical replacement which I still use. It is a good middle of the road drive and I generally have nothing to complain about aside from getting a defective drive right out of the box. Gaming barracuda is don't a lie. It a barracuda killer.

79,"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD ‚Äì USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PS4, & Xbox - 1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",Computers,"This feels nothing like my other Seagate externals I needed a larger drive for my ripped DVD files and this does the job. It holds the movies I play on PLEX. After reading the reviews and doing my research, I bought this for the family PS4 for storage. *sigh* It doesn't work. Have a PS4 Pro and with three gamers using the console, we needed more room but this isn't working. It is not recognized by the device, no matter which port I plug it into. Didn't return it, as we can always use it for the PC. Still, wish that it would have worked as expected. The drive installed fairly easily, but within 24 hours I got messages that the backup (using TimeMachine) had failed. I changed options to include system files, and so far the backups seem to be going smoothly. I had purchased a item similar too this and it worked great for a long time but it wouldn't connect to my xbox after a while so i bought another one and it worked for only 1 DAY then it wouldn't connect to my xbox nor computer. Na My Xbox one s I have 2 terrobyte storage works great This drive did not mount immediately on my new iMac (Aug 20 model).  Then, after re-formatting, it did mount and began to work with Time Machine; however, after one day of usage, I noted that the Time Machine backups were in part inaccessible and that Time Machine was otherwise not functioning properly.  So, I returned the item. Ok. It feels cheap. Light. Plastic. Compared to earlier inits. However, it works just fine. Great for the price but I might have received a used item. It wasn't packaged in a Seagate box and had a couple of scratches on the item. Just keep in mind it is a portable hdd. It's great if this is what u need, especially for extra storage.Just wish the cord was another 1-3 inches. It broke after 2/3 weeks. I was carrying it around a lot but I was taking good care of it and never dropped it or squished it. no Worked for 1 week, then will not format for ps4 and stayed corrupted. Not sure why. Worked fine the first week though This crashed on me in less than a year. Really disappointed. Lost all my back ups.do not buy. This is really a windows drive, to use for Mac is a headache.... If I could give this product a negative star rating I would, to say this drive is fickle is an insult to fickle things everywhere. I can't go 5 minuets without it crashing and closing all open windows, doesn't matter if those windows are from the files on the drive or not. It really does not like idea of moving files, or opening files, or looking at the files Icon, opening a folder on another drive. Basically, if I do anything with folders on this drive I risk having to do a hard reboot of my computer. As soon as I can get another drive to move my folders to, this POS is becoming target practice, hopefully it will last that long and I won't loose all my data on it. I wouldn't even be heartless enough to give this to my ex-wife Great External SSD to store large file Xbox games. Get one now because COD is way too big üôÑ Like the speed and storage size. I ordered the 2tb one and it was only 1.8 tb!!! I feel low key ripped off and am very upset! I've bought multiple seagate drives after having problems with them before, thinking..... there's no way I'll have issues with another. But this is the 3rd seagate drive to go bad on me within months of using it. I can't tell you what a headache it's been... and such a disappointment.I simply can't rely on these anymore and there's a reason why I don't get the large 5tb drives because I'd be losing that much data if they go bad. Trying to use on Xbox one. It won‚Äôt allow me to transfer. Any help? It only works on Mac. Extremely disappointed because I was to transfer the data from my mac laptop to my AlienWare.Other than that it has good capacity and speed in file upload. It would have been good to include a carrying case for this item. I connected to the USB port on my router so I could transfer files to nd from another computer.  I have had over a month and no problems. Never had to contact Tech support. We are using this as an external drive for our photos. Easy to use no problems. I like it, its small to put on top of any ps4 or xbox one. Got the 4 year protection just in case Great storage capacity, initially bought it so I could export all my photos and videos on my phone. I have a cable that could hook up my phone to the hard drive but my phone wouldn‚Äôt detect the hard drive. I also reformatted the drive to EXFAT but still wasn‚Äôt detectable.  In the end I plugged it into my computer to export the files. Looks nice, Pity it doesn't come with a case, or sleeve, or something to put this little tool in.I'll fire it up this week. And put it through it's paces. Not ready for use with Mac. Had to reformat. Took a lot of time to set up. Starting making terrible sounds after a slight movement from its place. It still works but I don't trust any data on in without a back up. Certain files were corrupted after typical use. It died after 32 days. Very unusual for Seagate. Every usb drive I have is a Seagate. Not one problem. Tried to repair with Seagate Seatools but failed all except 1 test and unable to fix. Now I have to get ahold of Seagate.Luckily I copied data to it. Still have original files. Good storage and worth of money Transferring 1Terrabite has taken 24 hours so far and the computer says there are 8 hrs remaining The storage space is nice. But I would rather buy a 1 tb SSD of which its‚Äô price has decreased over the years. Much faster to use when plugged in. Making beeping sounds.. is that usual? It has a 6 month life span Small drive. Does get warm. I tested on a MacBook Pro, tested 160-170MB/sec for large file on new drive. Pretty good.However I intended to use with a Pi 4 and it takes way too much power and cannot work with it. It violates the USB spec. Has to go back. Worked well for like 3 months then wouldn‚Äôt be recognized out of the blue one day. Lost all my games on it. Loved it at first, absolutely amazing storage capacity and runs games like butter. Though only 3 months after owning it, it STOPPED WORKING entirely. I‚Äôm thankful that the only thing on it was games, and that not a single save file was lost either :) no need for data recovery.Currently waiting for my warranty claim to finish. They were really nice and easy to talk to, helped me with all my worries. Only peeved that I‚Äôm now without the external storage on my computer :/ hopefully for just a few weeks tops though. Works great with no problems and i play heavy! I purchased this mainly because it was affordable and wanted to download games for Xbox one. I'm going to use it for videos an pictures but it doesn't allow games to be installed onto it for Xbox. Unreliable. Fine when it‚Äôs working but it constantly takes 30min to troubleshoot and get it working. I have a Mac And it just doesn‚Äôt work great. Very small and light, perfect backup and storage for the Laptop. Loved it all except it actually only registered 4.5TB not 5.  But that‚Äôs not a make it or break it considering the affordable price. Very quick loading times. It connected to the x box just fine lost some space to the fat table. Great for storage, longevity and protection can be better Its not a full tb its like 986gb but other then that it works perfectly fine. Works as designed CRAP CRAP CRAP! It stopped working after 3 months and ALL MY DATA IS GONE!!!!!! GOOD LUCK GETTING HELP FROM AMAZON OR ANYONE ELSE!!!! Great capacity, kinda slow. Use it for transporting VMs from one lab to another The drive was 1.8 TB not two I feel like I got scammed Worst storage device on the market cannot be used I demand a refund but I'm already past the time to get a refund so if I can save you the money and time please just don't buy this now I love for this company's customer service to finally pick up the phone and get back to me after the messages I've left. Advertised as 4 TB but only contains 3.63. Not a deal breaker but definitely disappointed with the false advertisement. Works awesome on my Xbox one, set it up in 20 seconds. Not sure if its the external I bought for my son may be a lemon thus far or if they are all like this. But, we transfered games off his PS4 to add space. Now when he goes to play the games, the external can't upload the data fast enough. So the games play in 64 bit. No detail, plain colors and just plain weird. Transfered back to the ps4 and works no problem. So be careful. Definitely a great purchase My daughter needed an external backup/hard drive for college classes.  I always use Seagate as they tend to last and can take a beating. Along with the frustration free packaging and cheaper build from the last generation, this feels like a bootleg. Been able to stores games from Xbox without any issues. I've had 4 portable externals in the last 10 years.  This is my first *anything* from Seagate, I will not purchase anything from them in the future.  Out of the 4 externals I've had, this is the only one that both A) feels cheaply made (weak feeling plastic case) and B) had ANY disk errors (even with heavy usage/poor handling and care).  I've used previous portables with little to no concern for their safety or well-being (thrown loosely into a packed bag, carried in pockets, left plugged into pc for a year+).  The portable caused me to lose ~20gigs of video on its first transfer to it.  Will be replacing as soon as financially viable. Luckily I still had all my files elsewhere. Very unreliable. It is the size of your hand so that's good. The cord is a bit small but thats ok. The problem im having is the device is falsely advertised sayin 2T its actually only like 1.75T so thats why I lowered the rating. This works perfect for our needs, so much so we have purchased 4 total! This drive is very slow compared to similar WD Elements drive.  This drive doesn't work at all with my Dell XPS13 laptop - it just clicks over and over.  Lastly, the drive arrived without its cable.  Generally, a disappointing purchase, but Amazon accepted its return as usual. Good to use epically at the price and I've had this for a few weeks now and no problems Very disappointed with this hard drive. Please, look elsewhere. I‚Äôm gonna have to say it,,, when I set it up on my Xbox series S, I only had 4.5 TB on my hardrive. Overall it doesn‚Äôt matter as a casual gamer but if you‚Äôre really serious that might be an issue This prodect doesn't have a usb c connection sadly.  Other than that its fine. I use these small portable USB drives as the backup drive, for each computer. I was somewhat disappointed that the box is sealed. But more disappointed that the activity LED is nearly invisible. If it were not sealed, I could have easily made the view hole to the activity LED larger. The drive worked well coming out of the box, though obviously slower than solid state drives.  After a bit over a month (just outside the return window!), it intermittently failed as my Time Machine backup drive.  I spent hours troubleshooting it before being told it's a problem with the drive.  We then spent an hour online and on the phone arranging a prompt replacement (otherwise waiting for a week or two).  With all that done, I should have just cut my losses, thrown it away, and bought some other brand.  Now I need to return this bricked drive and hope that my private data isn't compromised.  Very frustrating. Plastic box makes it look like a Chinese knockoff. But works and is a tad faster than the WD Elements. Works well with xbox one As of this review Its June 22,2021 , I purchased this product in the beginning of 2019 and over the amount of time I've spent with my external storage I can say it works great. Im a student in college who utilizes tech a lot and for the average person its a GREAT BUY!Personally I've kept many kinds of file types for homework, music, gaming, and movies and so much more! Very versatile with how it functions basically you just plug it and you are good to go with no hassle. If you are looking for super high speeds I recommend an External SSD( Solid State Drive) but it gets the job done with many things and I'm positive you'll be a happy customer!CAUTION: My only caution to a normal consumer is to be careful losing the cable include with the device as it is Micro B cable to USB as those won't be lying around your house. This hard drive worked the way it should for less than two months.  All of a sudden the power light no longer comes on and it isn't detected by my computer.  So I can't access anything I had saved on there.I've never written a bad review before in my life...so you can imagine how dissapointed i am to write this. I would have given this a 5 star review, however in the last few days it has begun to crash.  I purchased it as a back up for some of my more important business files and have had scramble to save everything.  For the year it worked - it was exactly what I needed. First off, I really dislike how amazon allows for reviews for ~17 different products to all live mixed together under the same rating.  These are not just tiny variations on the same product either.I just bought 2 of the 5TB portable drives.  They look identical.  The model number is identical.  The drives inside are most certainly NOT.  One of my drives writes and reads at over 100mb/sec (~115).  As expected.  The other drive, it reads at 85 mb/sec and only writes at 15mb/sec. (!) Not just in bench marks.  When actually moving many TBs of large files.  One one drive, it took 2 days.  The other drive, same data, ~8 hours.  I guarantee if I were to open them both up, they would be entirely different 2.5"" drives inside.  The slow one also makes more noise and vibrates more.  It seems to function properly, and basically runs like a 10 year old laptop drive.  But it can't possibly be the same hardware in there considering the other one is so much faster.  Just transferring the exact same large file, from one drive to the other, then back again, it's completely obvious we aren't dealing with identical drives, not even close.  The write speed is literally 6x faster on the normal one.  Read speed is also better. Seriously, Seagate?4-5 stars if I all I got was the normal working one.  That one is great.  It's identical brother though?  That drive is not great and it makes me leery to buy any portable devices from Seagate again.  (I own 4)Spread out your reviews, Seagate.  And fix the QA. I needed an additional backup external drive. When it arrived I hooked it up and nothing. It was dead upon arrival. I'm going to try a different brand. I need something reliable. Good and tough of Seagate, but disappointed in the speed. Even though it's USB 3.0 (AKA USB 3.1 GEN 1), the drive is a LOT slower to read and write than I expected. I have a different external drive that writes through the same USB 3.0 port at nearly 100 MB/s, but this one can't get about 40-50.When writing for a few minutes (it's a 4 TB, and at that slowness speed, it'll take about 5 hours to fill it up), it gets very warm. I have to stop it, because it's warm enough to worry. Works great for PS4 storage! It does have to 'repair' if your PS4 gets unplugged or shut off improperly but it takes like a minute and its good to go. Definitely recommend. Arrived Totally Dead.  It would not power up at all.  Tested it on multiple computers and with different USB cords. What is the one thing you want a hard drive to do? Keep working without a problem. Well I can't say if all of them won't last a year. I can say that mine did not last a year. So I won't be buying from them again. I guess there is a chance all HDDs can fail but no warning and it just quit on me. Buyer beware. It continues to show red light because it goes off line without any reason. Not sure if it‚Äôs not meant to reformat, but I can‚Äôt seem to reformat on my MacBook Air. Wanted to use this as my back up for my 1 terabyte on my PS4 because I'm slowly running out of space.  Unfortunately my PS4 will not accept this external because it will only recognize 1 terabyte or 8 terabyte external hard drives. So its not a total washout because I'll use it for my computer.  Sucks because it formatted the thing and all, just to say it won't accept it and I need one smaller or bigger. Great product. Good price. I ordered this as a Christmas gift and it didn‚Äôt have 1TB storage space as advertised, it had drastically less. Very disappointed. Amazon is sending a replacement and hopefully it‚Äôs the right one, won‚Äôt be getting it in time for Christmas though, no good!!!! I am satisfied Got it because I ran out of space on my PS5. I move all the game into this drive and it‚Äôs was very easy and fast. I bought this hard drive to store my games and for the first couple of months it worked, but now my pc wont detect the hard drive and after a few hours of trouble shooting it I've giving up. Connected this with the provided USB cable to the USB 3.x port on a new Alienware laptop.Transferring a bunch of files and the data speeds range from ~45MB/s all the way down to ~700KB/s (!!!). Average is below 10MB/s. Not remotely close to the advertised specs.Outrageous.Tech supports: only thing to recommend is defrag and format the drive.Again, Outrageous.There's NO reason to defrag then format a drive. Or visa-versa. None the less I had Windows take a look at it: 0% fragmented (of course).Should I have to reformat a brand new, pre-formatted drive? Only if the manufacturer really screwed up.So far it's taken the better part of two days to back up less than 1.5 Terabytes of data.Well, poop, guess it'l be going back. Loved it at first a place to store all my files, but is not reliable, it connects sometimes, and won't connect others.  I think its in the cord, but its a special cord. I don't use it anymore and replaced with direct connect USB Would disconnect and connect like usual and suddenly it corrupted most of my files and would not show anything in my folders. After a while it began to freeze my entire computer and I wasn't able to use it any longer. with just 2 games uploaded, over half my memory was gone. until this sweet thing showed, and now it is just a drop in the bucket... plug, choose, and play Bad hard drive! Had it for about a month then it's starts freezing out of nowhere.  Keeps repairing itself now it stopped working!:( Worked good for 6 months. It stoped working and is just beeping. What is the warranty on the hard drive? I need to get it replaced. Returning, this item isn't in original manufacturer packaging.  Looks used. Works, until you drop or tap it on anything, bought this twice separate, first was dropped and stopped working, second was tapped against something and now is a auto-windows-brick tool. Plugging it in now somehow breaks the OS {on an internal ssd} requiring a full reinstall. {Found out it was the reasoning the second time it happened}. Now I have an overpriced hack to corrupt anyone's computer.. yay? The drive was a brick after I formatted was the bad news. The good news is that they gave me back money. I‚Äôve now had two of the 2TB hard drives that just stop working and I‚Äôve lost over 50 games because of it If you're going to advertise it as being compatible with the PS4, then the PS4 should be able to format the hard drive. It was unable to, and now I have to do it manually After 4-months it no longer works, tried to open it on 2-pcs For some reason when I plugged this in with another one of my hard drive not only was it corrupted, BUT IT CORRUPTED MY PERFECTLY GOOD DRIVE ive been using all year. Luckily I didnt lose anything, but I can now to move anything on or off of this drive and it corrupted some of my Lightroom catalogs. Bought two and one is fine, but it freezes up my computer occasionally. Love my other senate drives, but these ones are absolutely terrible. Only keeping the other one because I need it for storage right now.. Works Great! Thanks It does what I need it to do- it holds a s***t ton of movies and shows that we stream direct from the hardrive to our computer. So far all is well, it doesn't lag and always shows up on the desktop (knock on wood) I bought the Seagate One Touch because of its high rating on a tech review site and also because it earned 4-1/2 stars here on Amazon. However, I started transferring 2TB of data to the drive over 24 hours ago and it indicates that it still has, ""about 6 hours"" to go! If I had known the write speed was this slow, I never would have purchased this drive. Buyer beware! Don't make the same mistake I did! It works fine I am not the most gentle person with a hard drive. But this one is broken now within a year. So I would say not the best harddrive to buy. I will buy a internal solid state drive for now. It works Received It did what we needed Not everyone knows how to use these tech items.  I'm having difficulty understanding how to actually save or transfer my information to the portable hard drive.  It should come with instructions for dummies. It was good while it lasted.. literally babied it, never let it leave my room or even touch the ground, and out of nowhere it stopped connecting to my xbox, started whirring and beeping loudly.. within the first month and a half i had it. Seriously, just get something better, i promise you its not worth it for you to deal with the bs of having to port 2tb of games to a new hard drive I recieved the seagate harddrive thinking that I would get 4 Terabytes but only to get 3.6 terabytes. Not what I paid for. Mini disc and instructions came in packaging but they're not in English. How am I to know what these are for or how to use them? I didn't get a cord with mine either. I had to puchase a separate one. Can't return because window closed for that, guessing I'm stuck with something I got shorted on and can't decipher instructions to figure out what all to do with it? Hoping Seagate will respond. Didn't know I had a problem until my computer started not working after I connected this to it (windows). They're the ones that pointed out this wasn't a complete external drive unit. Did I pay for a new one and get a return that was a partial box????!!!?? Furious about this. I was told this brand was one of the best. Can't say I agree at this moment. Will change my review if Seagate corrects this issue.Update 6/21/21:Drive has erased everything I had stored on it....keep getting ""fatal error on device"" message. Tried recovering and can't. Lost all pictures of loved ones who are now deceased. Can't get them back even with recovery software. This company has caused me extreme pain and regret!!!!! I used this 2TB Memory Storage one time. I load files onto it and when I went back to copy more the Security Code worked to unlock the unit, but would not load any contents to work with. Working with their Tech Support can be difficult as any repair effort must be completed in the day they are contacted or you have to start over again. works great. sometimes you have to unplug from xbox and plug back in for it to work. would‚Äôve given it 5 stars. Had one that stopped working in 3 months, got it replaced lasted 4 months. But all around you get what you pay for it just doesnt last even close to a Year. tried formatting it DIDNT SHOW UP IN DISK MANAGER. kinda pissed but only buy this if you want a short term hard drive which most of you dont want Perfect for my PS4 Completely doesn‚Äôt work properly anymore maybe it‚Äôs defective‚Ä¶. cannot format just doesn‚Äôt work anymore I'm using it to copy years of photoscans I did for my daughter.  I was trying to use a 2TB thumb drive and kept having trouble.  I was able to copy about 300GB from 2TB of data in a couple of hours.  Tested the files on the drive and all the samples were good.  Not sure but it seems more like an SSI drive instead of hard drive. It is very slow writing..should have just gotten a ssd I received a defective product that would not power up.  After chatting with Amazon support for an hour, I was told that the refund is only processed by the manufacturer.  I would rather eat the $100 than go through another manufacturer troubleshooting process and beg for a refund.  Be prepared! For a guy that was asked to pay $2000 for 200MB hard drive back in the 80s I am amazed the cost of storage has dropped and I've always had long-lived USB Seagate storage. I bought it to add more space for my Plex server, and man is it slow. Seems to max out at 5MB a second.Multiple times Ive have been trying to transfer many files at once and the drive just cant handle it and windows gives me an error, the drive disappears, and I have to fully reboot windows and unplug and replug the drive to get it to work again. Luckilly at this point I have pretty much filled it, and it doesnt have errors when using it to steam via plex. But still disappointed. Fairly quick. Worked great until my playstation fell on top of it. Then it started beeping and didn't work anymore. Tried to fix it but failed. My little brother got the same one and his stopped working for no reason. Not buying this product again. Going to try WD Elements external hard drive. I purchased this hard drive with the only purpose of saving everything that was on my computer, and it amazing! However... the part that i really didn't like was the formatting and the process of preparing the hard drive to receive the data that I wanted to transfer. Over all it came pretty quickly and I have no other complaint. Very little ‚ÄúFREE‚Äù software available. Most functions are available through the PAID Acronis software that is available for free with WD portable drives. 1 star for tech support...cause I didn't need to call them lol. Device worked no problem! Plug an play, and good to go! This drive was sitting on a PC, never moved.  I just realized the PC could not see it -- nor could any PC I plugged it in to.  It beeps erratically when I plug it in. After working with several different tech types, this phone was physically and technologically impossible to program!  I returned it and I am now very leery of purchasing unlocked cell phones online. I rarely leave bad reviews. But I spent days backing up my files only to have lost everything once this was over 3TB. All was fine and then suddenly there was a corruption and it would not work. The hard drive had to be reformatted and I had to start over but many of the files on this were lost forever. I have put another half TB on it but I DONT TRUST THIS.  No more Seagates. A lot of people criticize Toshibas but so far they are the only external drives I have not had issues with. For some reason Beyond drive I'm copying movies from is faster than the one I just bought and it's still a Seagate It was great until it started beeping! Looked up online, turns out the heads weren't in park position. IF I manage to put the heads back in park, that still means I have to somehow back up all my data (to where I'm not sure because I don't have enough room on my computer's hard drive (hence why I bought an external one)) and buy a new one. Not reliable at all!"
80,"SoftSheen-Carson Magic Razorless Shaving for Men, Magic Extra Strength Shaving Powder, for Coarse Textured Beards, formulated for Black Men, Depilatory, Helps Stop Razor Bumps, 5 oz, Red",Beauty and Personal Care,"I will have an allergic reaction to waxing, shaving and to Nair if I don‚Äôt do it just right, but I tried this stuff on my arms and I have not had an allergic reaction at all! It also takes less time than the nair does and there weren‚Äôt any patches or broken hair. HOWEVER as great as this product is it smells horrid!! You could 200% use this as a fart bomb because the smell will reach each corner of the house luckily it‚Äôll be gone the next day if you‚Äôve cleaned up. AND the smell won‚Äôt be on your body it just clings to the air. But I will say I am very hairy and have thick hair too that even waxing just breaks it, but this stuff got it all. Works amazing!! probably won‚Äôt ever shave again!! Even works for your downstairs area! I definitely recommend. Wow! Bought this after seeing it on Tik tok! I used it for my bikini area. No matter what products I‚Äôve used, I always get razor burn. This definitely did not give me any...but it also didn‚Äôt completely remove the hair. There are stir stubles. ok so no one told me that it smells and that you can possibly get a chemical burn. i personally ended up being just fine and actually really really like the product but just wanted to add those warnings because no one who hyped it up online mentioned it at least that i saw lol. i honestly think i‚Äôll be using this instead of shaving from now one. i used it on my arms legs armpits and downstairs snd it worked really well. i left it on for about 5 minutes then wiped it off with a wet washcloth. it smells way better than nair and unlike nair actually got off every single hair i put the shaving powder over. definitely need to wipe it off with a cloth to make sure it gets wiped off all the way just be gentle when removing to not irritate your skin and moisturize afterwards. i normally get itchy after shaving or the one time i used nair but i had no itchiness with this at all. baby lotion is one of the best things for your body‚Äôs skin in my opinion so is recommend using that after using this powder. i‚Äôve never been so stoked about a product until now I've been an avid Nair user for years but it either didn't get all the hair off or always almost burnt my neither region but this stuff is AMAZING. I tried it as soon as I got it and I'm as smooth as a baby. The smell is def not pleasant but totally worth it for how well this stuff works. This works amazingly well. Just follow the instructions and the hair just comes right off. So easy, so satisfying. The downside is the smell isn't good, but it's no big deal. It didn't make me gag or anything like that! Just light a candle when you're done or whatever. The other thing is that I had a zit and didn't think about this product on that, but that did sting a bit. Also not a big deal, but of course it would be great if that didn't happen. So I have very sensitive skin and it didn‚Äôt burn or irritate it at all. The smell on the other hand is atrocious. It has an incredibly strong sulfur smell that quickly increased to nauseating levels. Make sure you use in an overly ventilated area like outside. Learn from my mistakes and pass on this product. It took me like 30 minutes for the whole process and I would much rather shave if it‚Äôs gonna take me that long. Doesn‚Äôt take all hair off so you‚Äôll have to go back in and shave (whats the point then lmao). Also this doesn‚Äôt remove the hair from the root like waxing if you were wondering. I almost forgot to add that this smells like rotten eggs. Somebody said that before and I thought they were exaggerating but believe me. Do it outside not in your house Loved the results just let sit on and wipe away with a cloth hair is gone skins so smooth, have some ventilation it stinks pretty bad but smell doesn‚Äôt linger after rinse off. Def buying again It did it's job but it's not for sensitive skin for sure and it smells like relaxer when mixed with water. It was everything I expected it to be. I will definitely keep using it because it did what it was supposed to. This product has the worst smell!!! It didn‚Äôt even remove my hair 0/10 Oh gosh, the smell is awful. You get a used to it pretty quickly while mixing and applying but any housemates might have an issue so far this is the best thing I've used on my face! I have skin conditions that constantly cause ingrown hairs and this is the least affected by that so I have my best skin. It smells SO BAD. Like eggs and death. My boyfriend was so grossed out by the smell he didn‚Äôt want to use the bathroom. It didn‚Äôt even work that well. It was okay but it missed large areas If you ever take any advice from me, DO NOT BUY THIS. You will smell like an egg that resurfaced from the 1800's. My ENTIRE house smelt like this. I am talking all 3,000 sq feet of my house smelt like satans #2. I thought I was tough, I thought that I could handle the smell. But boy... was I wrong. This will bring a dead man back to life. After lighting 12 candles, Febreeze, and Ozium, the smell still lingers. This product is no different, actually, I take that back this product is Nair's evil step sister. But seriously, same idea as Nair, more mess since you have to basically become a chemist to make it, and the smell... well you got the point. (I‚Äôm a woman that used this on her legs lol) The smell wasn‚Äôt bad at first but definitely got worse as it stayed on. Did it‚Äôs job though! Felt like my hair didn‚Äôt grow back as fast compared to shaving. I did get a few razor bumps but my skin is also ultra sensitive. My skin was kind of dry but lotion did the trick after. Works well, if you can get past the smell. Smelled like we set off a stink bomb in our entire house for no less than 12 hours.Really does work well though. Its amazing for taking off hair but it doesn‚Äôt go a long way. Ive done both my legs one time now and the bottle is half empty. Both the hair is GONE though so thats amazing. The smell is rotten eggs that lingers in the air and on the skin but if it takes off my hair ill deal with that. First off, this stuff STINKS!!!! My house smells horrible. I tried to contain it and not be messy by doing it in my bathroom. Nearly impossible. It got EVERYWHERE. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get rid of the smell. As for it working. Yes and no. My thighs are baby smooth. However my calves, it didn‚Äôt do anything. I more than likely will never use this product again, even though I‚Äôm extremely happy with the results on my thighs (and the little bit that got on another area if you know what I mean) but the mess and smell is just not worth it in my opinion. So I give it a 50/50. If you can handle the smell and figure out how to not make such a mess by all means go for it. I let it sit on my legs a little longer than recommended also and it still didn‚Äôt do anything for my calves, also they are BURNING even 1 hour after I washed it off. A lot of the reviews I read before buying said this didn‚Äôt happen. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you have sensitive skin. Make sure you‚Äôre not wearing jewelry because there is something in the product that ruins them. They will tarnish.Also the smell is awful.Great news though! The product works‚Ä¶ Worked, but didn‚Äôt make my legs crazy smooth and has a HORRIBLE smell Would not buy again It works yes how ever it dryer my skin out and it smells like death. But it works lol I didn't have any reactions to it. However for ppl that have reactions to nair shouldn't use with out testing on small patch of skin. Make sure to moisturize after. This irritates my skin so so much. I was careful and followed instructions but I was still left with a rash that burned. this is worst god awful smelly crap ever! it works but there are way easier ways! plus there is a unscented one my friend swears by i bought this because i have sensitive skin and prone to strawberry legs but it works so well and the price is right. Works well, does the job, the smell is absolutely terrible. You aren‚Äôt getting it for the moisture. You are getting it for the smooth finish it will you üêà it works well, but it didn‚Äôt take everything off, but much better than shaving. STINKS TO HIGH HEAVENS!!  Beware of the smell. Works great but stinks so bad Not for sensitive skin at all. Burns, dried my skin out. Scent of it just plain stinks Don‚Äôt buy this BURNED MY SKIN and the smell. The smell is super strong and it smells like rotten eggs and it also makes a big mess one dry just save your money and just don‚Äôt buy it! I have sensitive skin and it didn‚Äôt irritate it but it REAKED. It made my entire house smell for days. It did get most of the hair off my legs though so if razors irritate you and you don‚Äôt mind the smell it is worth a try! Removed hair nicely and leaves your legs feeling smooth. Although it smells very strongly of egg. I would say this product is best used outdoors. I found this product because of tik tok decided to try it because shaving with a razor is annoying. It worked amazing in 7 minutes I was bald. I don‚Äôt have sensitive skin so it didn‚Äôt cause me any irritation and I could barely smell it. I was hopeful. However this stuff will stink up your entire house‚Ä¶.the smell is horrendous!!! Also, my leg hair grew back so quickly after. They were smooth for about a day. I was under the impression this helped keep them smooth longer than regular shaving. I was very disappointed altogether with this product. I‚Äôll stick to shaving. Works great, but smells like rotten eggs and dog poop... also, it‚Äôs super hard to figure out the right powder to water ratio and takes a lot of time just to make it, def won‚Äôt buy again, I switched to the nair lotion, works the same, but it moisturizes and smells good. it works very well but it smells terrible it stunk up my entire house It stinks terribly but it works great on legs AND bikini area. I can‚Äôt really say whether or not it‚Äôs good for the men. But ladies if you‚Äôre using this for your leg hair would not recommend. It got barely any hair off. Plus the smell is practically unbearable. I almost gagged on the smell and I don‚Äôt gag easily. Like I said would not recommend it also really dries out your skin Hardly worked. Smells disgusting Works great, made my whole apartment smell like rotten eggs for 2 days (i lit candles, scentsys, incents, opened door/windows, and sprayed all around. Easy to apply besides the back of my thighs. I recommend. This product does smell so get out your candles or air fresheners before you start. Otherwise this product works great!! The scent is horrendous!!!!! It works amazing but it's so hard to get past the smell Smells terrible. I had better luck with the cream. Worth a bit more money to avoid the smell and mess. As a woman, this worked great for my facial hair since I have PCOS. But the smell is horrific and smells like rotten eggs. I would suggest applying outside or else your house will smell like it for days. I tried applying to my legs and it got them smooth but didn‚Äôt last longer than a day. Also applied to binki area and it did okay but I still had to go back in with a razor to get off the excess hair. Also if you have to use this daily or every other day I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the value, even when it is $4. I‚Äôll stick with shaving unless I want baby hairs removed. Despite the REALLY bad smell, I love it. It doesn‚Äôt give my sensitive skin razor burn and it actually takes ALL the hair off. I will be buying again. This smells horrible and lingers for a while!!! I feel like this may be bothering to people with sensitive skin. Works great, smells awful. Smells terrible. Not worth the effort if your a woman. This is by far the worst thing i have ever smelled. It smelled like actual rotting eggs. It made the ENTIRE 3 bedroom apartment smell. Do not get this unless you live alone. And, it only works on really long hair. It did work well on long hair, but not short hair. Honestly even though it did a good job i will never be buying again because the smell was so rancid. I got the extra strength, and it‚Äôs so easy to use. Yes, it smells terrible but if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS (*cough cough* i don‚Äôt think some people in these reviews did) and leave it on for 7-9 mins (i know this is a bit longer than recommended, i have really thick hair). I safely use it on my pubic area (careful to not get it on the inside ladies). I used to get horrible razor burn, but with this everything is so smooth! Keep it wet with a spray bottle of water. Wipe it off after 7 mins and the messy cleanup afterwards is worth it! This stuff works but OMG THE SMELL IS AWFUL. It made my WHOLE house smell like sulfur FARTS LOL for hours.  It does its job but oh dear god the smell was just too much üòÇ This stuff stinks and directions didn't make anything but stinky liquid so I had to keep adding rotten egg powder. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND Smells horrible, doesn‚Äôt give a smooth shave for me, just shortened the hair This product t does it‚Äôs job, but it has a repulsive odor that smells literally like rotten eggs Okay so overall, yes it is a pain free, razor free way to get rid of hair but it SMELLS. It's honestly not worth it because of the smell. My legs were smooth for maybe 3 days. If it were longer, like a week, then I would put up with the smell. But it's the exact same as if I were to just shave my legs. Takes the same amount of time overall and just smells WAY worse. I guess if you have no sense of smell and always cut yourself with the razors, then yeah, use this product. But honestly I thought I could handle any smell, and this I cannot handle. It is PUTRID. Like rotten eggs mixed with dog poop and vomit. Smells like rotten eggs for awhile, so use ahead of time, but it work pretty good! Works well for my daughter, but smells like rotten eggs. Stinks, yes. Works,  YES!I have sensitive skin and this didn't bother or burn me at all. My skin felt like a babies. Clean!Update: Used product 4 days later, burned one are of my face to the right of my goatee. I won't use again. As far as removing hair goes, yes, does that well. Side effects such as chemical burn are no fun tho so it's a no go for me. got the job done, just didn't like the smell Works but you do have to keep the area you are treating damp as this product sets into the hair and it has a sulfuric odor so work in a well vented area and keep a misting spray bottle on hand (Review written by my wife) Look this product works but I would never buy again!!! Ever! This stuff smelled horrible stunk up the whole entire house. And do NOT let this get on to nails!!! I used my hands to apply and this stuff made my nails WEAK! Also do not let it touch your jewelry my once sliver rings are now a copper color. I would NEVER use again and would NEVER recommend this product to anyone else!!!! Do not use this product! i don‚Äôt think any of these reviews quite capture how utterly RANCID this powder is. i‚Äôm writing this next to a candle, perfume in hand, and with veRy scented lotion on legs and all i can smell IS ROTTEN EGGS. the slight convenience of not having to shave is not at all worth how bad my entire bathroom and any room i‚Äôm in smells right now. i literally spent an hour scrubbing my shower walls and counter tops and it‚Äôs STILL THERE. i wish i was born without a nose. The product actually changed my strrljj in big silver jewelry to a gold tone üò° Works ok but smells TERRIBLE Giving low stars because of the smell. My whole place smells like it afterwards. It‚Äôs awful Reading the other reviews, I was aware of the smell BUT the smell was out of this world. The smell of rotten eggs filled my entire house. Disgusting! Second problem was it turned the bottom of my bathtub brown, I had to scrub it out with pure bleach. Last but not least, it left a white haze on my legs and had to scrub it off a few times. Bottom line is, I rather just use a good ole fashion razor! Too much work, mess and oder! Smells like stinky eggs but not as bad as other brands that smell like it‚Äôs burning. My skin reacted really well to it (arm pits, legs, arms and the V area) now everyone‚Äôs skin is different so definitely do a test before you do the sensitive spots. And I did stay very smooth and silky for about 2 weeks (will start staying longer the more you use) This product gave me a chemical burn.  It did not work well.  Dried up too fast. Made the whole house smell like rotten eggs. I threw it away.  Don‚Äôt waste your money.  Horrible product and messy too! Product must be fresh. Carefully follow the instructions. This product works well for those who don't take well to razors or who have skin-sensitive issues with them. it only takes a small amount and it stunk up my whole house with a nasty egg smell, I recommend buying sented kind. other than that it worked fairly well but it took a while to dry andwas messy but for the price not bad Okay, first of all it stink. It like nasty eggs. Its pretty good at removing hair, but i ended up geting a rash all over my stomach. It looked like little red dots just covering me from my stomach to my back. I don't know why. That was the only new thing i had used when it happened, so be careful. it smells sooooooooo bad like omgit smells like rotten eggs if you get the powder on carpet vacuum it bc the smell will stay. now it works it just smells really bad just use nair Awesome on my sensitive skin. Its very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling amazing even after a couple of days. I will definitely be buying more This stuff STINKS! I mean like awful surfer smelling crap. Not to mention it didn‚Äôt to a good job of removing hair on my legs. I will never use this stuff again. I trashed it after my first experience. Smells like rotten eggs and hurt my armpits. TikTok lied. Hahaha you thought nair smelled bad??? Jokes on you. This crap smells 10x stronger than nair, but to top it off it smells like they just crumbled the smallest amount of dog crap into the mix. If you want to burn and hurt this is the product for you. Horrible stuff. I also mailed them back and still have not gotten my refund Very drying and smells horrible, no matter how much you try to clean up or mask the smell it will make your bathroom smell like rotten eggs for DAYS. it does get rid of hair, but it sometimes takes multiple attempts, and it‚Äôs just too messy. Used this a few times but it was too much work than it was worth so I stopped. You can find a better product than this. It could be great for the skin and moisturizing BUT could not get past the smell!! Our whole house stunk when my daughter first used it!! We threw it right in the garbage the smell was that bad!!"
81,TOZO T6 True Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones Touch Control with Wireless Charging Case IPX8 Waterproof Stereo Earphones in-Ear Built-in Mic Headset Premium Deep Bass for Sport Black,Electronics,"Overall these are good if you‚Äôre listening to music or taking a trip and need the external noise cancellation. If you‚Äôre using them to take calls too the microphone is too sensitive and picks up on every little sound. When I‚Äôm outside and take a call people tell me they can‚Äôt listen because the birds are too loud. Great sound and battery life. Works great in the shower too.  Phone calls are clear. The smallest plug is too large. They fall out. Charge didn't last as advertised For the price point, these are incredible. These earbuds fit well, sound great relative to their price, pair and charge quickly, and are good for basic podcast /music listening at work or commuting. However, I haven't been able to figure out how to get people to actually hear me on the phone while using them. I can hear the speaker, but they can't hear me. I followed the reset options, but still couldn't get this resolved. I have an iPhone 7. I paid $25 for on Prime Day, they are worth that price.  I've had them a couple of weeks with no problems. Pairing is very easy. Sound quality good for podcasts and phone calls.  For music, they are just ok, not recommended for serious music listening. first things first these are not noise canceling and also doesn't come with the charging base in the pictures. I was happy with these when I got them and would use them for going to the gym and working out. After 2 days, the right earbud went out. I noticed it would slowly dampen in sound and I thought it my be the battery or some earwax. I then checked it and there was no gunk and I left them in their case overnight only to see that the right one was now fully defunct.  I'm super dissapointed as I just wanted wireless earbuds for the gym. Disconnection issues big time and now the charger box doesn't work for the right earbud wth Right out of box, earbuds did not not together.  We can get the right or left to work, but not both at the same time.  These are disappointing and will be returned. They stop charging dont know why but i loved them they are good but needs alil more work on them There is a slight mismatch between Left and Right channels of audio and it is not easy to ignore. People not that in to audio quality may be okay with this but it was too annoying for me, tampering all the songs I loved with a slight robotic sound effect. I've had several pairs of Ear Buds that were 4 times more expensive and these are as good.  The battery life is amazing.  I use my buds to listen to books and take calls on my walks. I would give them 3.5/5.  They are probably as good as I should expect at this price.  Sound quality is pretty good, battery life is good.  My main issue is that anytime I touch these in my ears it either pauses what I'm listening to it skips forward or back one track.  Anytime they get loose and start coming out of my ear and I try to adjust them it will activate touch control and there is no way to disable that. There is nothing that I dislike about these headphones. I love these but cannot get them to stay in my ears!  I am constantly picking them up from the floor wherever I am! It is hard to use the tap feature for use.  When I want to turn off it turns up volume.  When I just need to adjust in my ear it skips 10 seconds.  But sound quality is amazing and I don‚Äôt hear any outside noices. The charger case has to be recharged constantly. I only use them for maybe thirty minutes at a time and after about the second or third time of use I have to recharge the case. Seems excessive compared to other earbuds I've had in the past. The sound is really good, the battery life has kept me happy (you practically forget to charge it). The only problem is that they are slippery especially when you run and sweat and they could very easily fall down. This worked awesome when i first got it but it suddenly stopped working. Not bad. They battery life could be better and sound sometimes cuts in and out. Also has trouble pairing sometimes. Not bad but could use improvement. Great headphones.  Very good quality Nice quality earbuds!! They even come with several different size rubber ear poeces ti fit to ur exact ear size...UNBELIEVABLE!! Earphones keep falling.. no compatibility with Siri.. We have had these from January to August of the same year before one of the two headphones stopped working. They were great quality before they quit after seven months. The price is too much to have to replace them every seven months. I like them, but I don't like how they constantly keep needing to be reconnected to my phone when Im not using my wifi at home. This kind of worked and then just had too many issues so I returned it. It you want to adjust the earbud you‚Äôll hit the touch button which pauses or skips the song. And often one ear bud will not pair randomly and then you‚Äôre using one for the rest of the workout. Obviously it is the cheap/disposable solution so better than nothing for the price, but for me, it would‚Äôve just sat around since I stopped using it. First of all, very inexpensive, but not cheap. They can be used independently. Paired quickly to my I-phone without a problem. The sound is good unless you are an audiophile, but preference is in the ear of the beholder. If you are not looking for anything noise canceling these for the price are just fine. Why pay $180+ for something you could possibly loose? I would recommend this to anyone. Btw sounds great on the phone, which is why I purchased them, enjoy!!! EDIT: And almost forgot :) did I mention they were waterproof!!!!! Rather solid all-around for headphones in their price range. Got them in the mail and they worked and charged fine, but after 5 days of use the left earbud is considerably quieter than the right earbud. I've tried everything to correct this and swapped them in my ear just to make sure I wasn't losing my hearing, but yeah the left earbud just wont get as loud as it used too. I wanted to like these, but they were way too quiet and the sound was lacking any sort of bass. I tried changing audio settings, removing volume limiter and adding volume booster apps, but nothing helped. Didn't have this issue with other Bluetooth earbuds. Would have given a 1 star rating for the product, but bumped it up based on their quick refund. I was skeptical, but the amazing reviews got me and I absolutely love them so far! Satisfy Sound is great. Only problem I have it that it CONSTANTLY falls out of my ears. Eating, talking, walking, or even just sitting there long enough causes them to just fall out of my ears. Bummer but I got them for $40 so can't expect too much. Gross review ahead.These earbuds sound 5-star great, and are relatively light and comfortable enough‚Ä¶ as long as you don't plan on sweating with them in. Unfortunately, my only use for them is while running or mowing the yard ‚Äî high-sweat activity. The earcups that actually fit my ears create such a seal that my ears got no ventilation and  an extremely uncomfortable irritation happened in both ears within about an hour of using them (for roughly 30-90 minutes). Washed with light soap and water immediately, but woke up with both ears feeling stopped up, lots of drainage happening. Left ear's infected now. Ouch.This happened both times I used the earbuds, so it can't be a coincidence. Maybe I have sensitive little ears, maybe the irritation wouldn't have happened if I wasn't physically active while wearing them, but that's kinda the point of having bluetooth earbuds.So‚Ä¶ high ratings for sound, noise cancellation and battery life, but overall low ratings for causing me physical pain. Would not recommend. Gonna go spend $250 on the good stuff like I should've in the first place. Very strange, I've never actually had a product just stop working like this. We bought these for my wife to use to listen to relaxing hypnobirthing music while giving birth, so it's especially lame that the left earbud just died for no reason.Very frustrating, since these aren't actually that cheap. Oh well, you get what you pay for I guess??? At this point, I certainly can NOT recommend these TOZO headphones to anyone.I'm going to try to call the company and see what the deal is, hopefully they can help with troubleshooting tips. If they're able to help, I'll update this review! Awesome ear buds, fit snug in my ear I like the headphones and good sound quality.  But when on calls anyone I talk to can hear everything in background. Good battery. Like 5 hours out of each earbud. Due to the call sound quality I would not recommend. Work good, can't play bass type stuff at full volume without a bit of distortion. But outside of that worth the money for the price. Everything seemed okay on these. Liked color, sound, etc. But they were too big for My small ears. I like the battery life in this product but it won‚Äôt let me answer my phone calls!!! These earbuds lasted me almost three months. Within the 2nd month of owning these earbuds the left one started to sound lower than the right one for some reason, and now the right one is starting to have the same problem. Will go between the normal volume to a low volume and it keeps doing that. I loved these earbuds at first but they didn't last me long. These are pretty good and the price was great. Was surprised how good the music sounded and they so far are easy to use. Wouldn't pair. Wasted 45 minutes trying to get it to work. Headphones are fine. Controls are good, sound is decent. They quit charging after like a month however. The contacts weren't making a positive connection, meaning they would also stay on while in the case and connect to stuff accidentally. I cleaned the contacts and it worked for awhile but ultimately I gave up when it started happening again. These worked just fine for the last month and half. Now they‚Äôve stopped working already. I looked to contact the manufacturer to see if they can help, but that info is not readily available despite saying you can contact.  Thumbs down. The sound quality is fine but not amazing as posted in some of the reviews. Low on bass. No app for control tuning. Battery life is decent when compared to options in the price range. Might be fine for listening to music, but microphone picks up so much background noise that no one can understand what you're saying. At one point, it actually overwhelmed the data connection on my conference call. They are comfortable, they have good sound, and has decent battery life. üëçüèº Only got to use them for a little while. What I did get to use them had fantastic sound. I ordered these headphones in late May, so about three months ago. I use headphones nearly every day, and I wanted to find a quality pair that didn't break the bank. These seemed to be it! I had no issues with them whatsoever until last week. I pulled them out of my work bag to use, and they stunk! They have an electrical burning smell to them. I don't know what has happened to them but I don't dare use them anymore. I have used them quite a bit, but have been careful with them and have no idea why they smell like that. I loved these headphones so much after I bought them that I recommended them to my family. My sister bought a pair and her headphones have developed the same smell. I am very disappointed, because I have tried other brands of Bluetooth headphones before and these were the best ones I have tried. Unfortunately, I am now on the hunt for a new brand to try as I'm not sure if I should give this brand another chance. I read through the reviews to see if any other users had the same experience, but it seems our cases are anomalies. I want to add that if I had reviewed these headphones prior to last week, I would have given them five stars. But since this recent development, I cannot honestly give a good review. I am very disappointed in this product, because I thought I had found a brand that I could use and trust for a long time. Does not have good range Setup is easy and they are attractive, but the audio volume is very low. iPhone on maximum volume, they are audible in a quiet environment but not at all loud. In a noisy environment they are pretty much inaudible. I very much liked the fit and sound quality of these earbuds. The problem is that they cut in and out when my phone is in my pocket. This defeats the purpose of having these. I tried them paired with both a Samsung S10 and a Moto G Fast and had the same results. (Different shorts and pants too). If I wanted to carry my phone in my hand I would use wired earbuds.***Update***My original pair had issues as stated above, but after contacting customer service I was very pleased when they sent me a replacement. These sound and work great. Excellent bang for your buck. Very satisfied customer. They stayed charged forever and stay in your ear throughout any activity even sleeping which ive accidently done a few times First of all, these aren‚Äôt bad, but they aren‚Äôt great either. They‚Äôre loud, but kind of tinny- I‚Äôm unimpressed with the bass when compared to wired $20 earbuds of comparable size. Most importantly for me, the mic sucks. Even in my quiet house, people have a difficult time hearing me- this makes car calls impractical, as I‚Äôve got to yell the whole time and still apparently don‚Äôt come through clearly. These buds get B+ for effort, C on delivery. I couldn't add a video because, well....I can't find them.Yep, I use them for 2 days. Amazing sound and noise canceling.  I could barely hear the screaming.Until I lost one. Now it's half screaming g half Hansen's MmBop on repeat.However the screaming continues and I can't make it go away because I've lost them.When there's no cord, you lose them, wash them or accidently ingest them. So I've been looking...everywhere. and I mean everywhere.However if you were to properly take care of these, you will be able to enjoy noise canceling and touch Bluetooth, volume and pausing. And they are just USB charged and super portable.Get them.if you like tiny thi gs you can poop out. Wanted to love these. The sound quality and bass are great for the price. However, the earphones keep randomly disconnecting! Love it. Long lasting They were way too big for my ears and I had a hard time touching them without pausing, playing, turning off or on whatever bc they are so sensitive. And I have tiny hands so I can‚Äôt imagine someone with large hands using these. Sound seemed pretty decent quality but the bulkiness of them overshadowed any good about them. got my box and was surprised it only had 1 earbud even more surprising is it doesn't work. The control mechanism is broken when earbuds are wet. They will turn on and off, volume + or - themselves. It is incredible for the price, but it definitely falls out of my ear too easily when I run. I was running to class and it fell out and almost got run over by a car lol I didn't know what to expect for my first pair of cordless headphones but these are freaking amazing!!! Don't hesitate! Just buy them! I've had mine for almost 2 months and I haven't had to charge them yet, although I'm getting close. The sound is amazing and really allows me to get in the zone at the gym. The fit was a little something to get used to, but I haven't had headphones in awhile. They definitely won't fall out when running or other high movement workouts and they pair quickly and effortlessly with my phone. These are the best. They exceeded my expectations and I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone! These are awesome!!!  Great quality!  Would highly recommend. These constantly cut in and out of being connected to my phone. Rarely work properly when trying to answer or make phone calls. I have resorted to using an older set because these are UNRELIABLE. I do not recommend. They‚Äôre like the most quiet headphones I‚Äôve used in my life same as headline  ... no bass and expensive for the sound quality Make sure to order with their charging pad. Product looks great and sound is excellent, however:- earbuds easily fall out- controls on the earbud are too sensitive: b/c fit is not snug, if you touch the earbud to get it more secure, the controls will move you ot the next song or pause/stop what you are listening to. You‚Äôll know what I mean Sound is decent.  Good bass. Mine would constantly connect to my phone while in the case. Decent over all but I got a different set of headphones I‚Äôm much happier with for the same price. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the reviews I love the ear buds tjey sound incredible at tjis price range. Badd is there im a producer so id like to think i have an ear for music. Iebut litterally they have just now after months of owning these have dipped underwater about half a foot for half a second 2 seconds at most. one time and one of them have pooped out on me. Ive jad ipx8 waterproof phones dip in the pool and work just fine so i dont lnow why these would be so delicate unless is werent actually ipx8 certified. Not gonna lie im ordering them agaim cuz i csmt find the sound quality for the price around. But i wish you would be real about how waterproof they are. Call it nitpicking if you want but integrity is everything They sound great. The touch sensitive controls are a little hard to get used to. Overall a great value for the money. Sound is not that great not worth The only positive thing I can say is that they work.Something you should know before purchasing, there is a VERY annoying announcer which will inform you each time you touch the device. They sound fine but the touch pad on buds is either non responsive or too responsive. The case lid has no locking or force behind it to keep it closed so it opens with barely a touch. Of which is frustrating because it opens in my bag and auto connects to my phone then I miss phone calls because it‚Äôs ringing in the buds not where I can here it. I have a woodshop and LOVE these headphones. I love that I can use one or both to listen to something and the sound quality is great either way.  I also like that the carrying case doubles as a charger for them.  The only thing I don't like about them is how sensitive to touch they are, but I get they have to be since they're wireless. It's a little annoyance I don't mind dealing with. I have dropped these things EVERYWHERE, out the car, off the bed, out my pocket...case still closes and charges as it should, it's just scratched up. Sound quality is great for the price, not anything AMAZING or anything but definitely better than the price suggests. Sound also doesn't bleed out which is a major plus. No noise cancellation or anything, but they're not advertised as such so I'm not bothered by it They didn‚Äôt turn on That's my third attempt to buy a decent earpod. They are all cheap, but you get what you paid for: keeps getting disconnected. terrible fitting, ordinary sound quality, one of the pods keeps dying, cant get charged. I will ask for a FULL REFUND on all my earpods oders. I will buy an used apple pod. At least I know what i am getting. I bought these primarily to have one in an ear to listen to podcasts or NPR around the house or in my studio while I work. They fit well (not an easy task with the way my ears are shaped, apparently, as Apple earbuds just fall out) and they sound fine. I like the case, and it holds a charge longer than I've ever needed to keep it in my ear. Also, the left can be used independently, so if you're just using one of them like me, one can be charging while you're using the other.My biggest problem with these - and this is kind of a deal breaker - is that the ""Touch Control"" is way too sensitive.  If you reach up from time to time to reposition / push it in because it's starting to slip a bit, the Touch Control pauses whatever your listening to.  It's very frustrating.  Even if you're wearing gloves!  I would like to be able to completely turn off the Touch Control.  If you have an Apple Watch, it's totally not needed.  It's easier to pause, answer calls, etc. with the watch.  Or on your phone.  Whoever thought Touch Control on earbuds was a good idea was sorely mistaken.  It's a royal PITA.  Please give us an option to turn it off! These headphones are great for the first month, then they stop connecting to each other.  Yes, I went through the factory reset procedure and it didn‚Äôt help.  These are cheap for a reason.  Don‚Äôt buy them. Dislike the difficulty to use.Cannot change ear piece sizeNo matter  how I try. The onAnd off etc. Touch area is absurd! Not even using themJust way too much trouble! If you like your music loud these might be a bit disappointing. As far as protecting your hearing is concerned these are great. But sometimes I need my music louder than my thoughts and these really don‚Äôt get THAT loud.These are ONLY earbuds, you can‚Äôt talk on the phone with them etcThey‚Äôre great for the price, and if you only want to listen with them. I‚Äôd like to say you can get it with peace of mind because it has good quality of bluetooth. Also battery life is good and voice quality. I can't say anything about its longevity because I haven't used it for a long time UPDATE:  I purchased these June 6.  It‚Äôs August 20 and they quit charging.  I rarely use them, they stay in my bedroom 24/7 in their charging case and I only use them when I‚Äôm laying in bed and even then it‚Äôs only one earbud at a time.There‚Äôs no reason for them to both suddenly quit charging.  The case is lit up, so it‚Äôs plugged in and it‚Äôs never been unplugged.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  So these function just fine, the sound is good and I would buy them again except for one feature I absolutely HATE:  they have a touch control on the flat surface of the earbuds.This means if I adjust them, take them out, put them in, they just automatically start playing the music in my iTunes library.  My iTunes app is never even open when this happens.  And I don‚Äôt ever use these to listen to iTunes.So I have to go open my iTunes app and STOP playing the song every time. If I grab one to switch ears, or take it out for a second- again, here comes the musicAnd it‚Äôs almost impossible to NOT touch the ‚Äútouch screen‚Äù surface when handling them.  It‚Äôs just a PITA and a stupid feature.  I want to control what I‚Äôm listening to from my phone, not be tapping Morse code on my earbuds to cycle through features I don‚Äôt want Keeps disconnecting These can't be beat for the price and are very comfortable. I use them everyday at lunch and have had to charge the case for them only one time in over a month. A very good buy! As the title says - these air buds are pretty good, but the one thing that bothers me the most about them is the fact that they're hard to take out.  I find myself struggling to take them out of the charging case because the air buds are so smooth.  It would've gotten a five star with me if it wasn't so difficult to take out. Great for noise cancellation, but if you touch slightly off when trying to pause, the whole podcast will rewind or skip to the next in line. Very frustrating. The buds don't stay in my ears.  when trying to adjust them it is easy to push the buttons that turn them on and off or change the volume. I accidentally went swimming with my Apple ear buds my bad; they were ruined.  I borrowed my Dad's Fotos and they are just as good so I ordered my own pair ( at a fraction of Apple price). They seemed to fit nicely, with lots of options to get them to fit just right. I'm returning them however because even at max volume they are not very loud. Other than that they seemed pretty nice for the short time I tried them. They work fine, but even with the smallest size ear buds they are still a little big for my ears. They also randomly turn on when they are charging in the case and connect to my phone. The sound is very low Doesn‚Äôt hold a charge very long at all. Device has to be very close to the earbuds. The start and stop button is very sensitive. I have to say, these has been the best earbuds I've purchased so far. Good battery life and sound quality, I haven't purchased galaxy buds because they're expensive. These are great for the price I paid. The sound quality of these earbuds is horrific. Cons:I was so excited to get myself new earbuds and fell in love with these for the price. However, I was disappointed when I couldn‚Äôt walk around without adjusting my earbuds every few minutes. I had to choose the smallest ear cushion and they still didn‚Äôt fit well in my ear. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the cushion size, but mostly the shape and size of the ear device itself that‚Äôs the problem. These stick more up, meant to fill in the shape of your ear for a snugly fit. Meanwhile, for me they stick out too much and pop out when I thought I fit them well in my ear canal. I used the pictures to help guide me too but still they fall out. The left one falls out more though. What I‚Äôm used to are the AirPods design where the earbud mostly rests on your ear and hangs down.Pros:Love the battery life and clear sound though! A little bit more boost would be nice, but with Spotify I can fix that. The touch controls are sensitive enough so I don‚Äôt have to look furiously for the sweet spot or press hard.And like I said before, the price is what caught my eyes along with the positive reviews. This is a great product to use for first time wireless bluetooth earbuds. I bought this during their Prime Day and it was one of the featured products. If you are in a quiet area, you can hear the other person clear as day. But once you start doing dishes, watching tv, playing with kids, or are outside hearing planes go by, birds chirping, cars driving - YOU HEAR EVERYTHING WITH THEM. So much, in fact, that it drowns out their voice. As soon as I find a better quality pair, I'll stop using these earbuds. But they make a great backup. The earbuds work well. Funnily I bought these after I lost one of Kurdene earbuds ($25 on amazon). I immediately recognize that both brands sell the same product with different labels. I've used these headphones pretty much every day since I bought them 6 months ago. I purchased a pair for my daughter and liked hers so much I got another set for myself.Unfortunately, one of her earbuds stopped connecting with the charger within the case just recently. Placing them in my case worked, but despite cleaning the contacts hers will not charge. We ended up buying her a new pair (different brand).Mine still charge but now the sound is going. There is a lot of noise when I use them - like listening to music through a speaker that's starting to go bad. When I use a different set of earbuds with the same device, the sound is fine.It's a shame because, as I said, when these were working they worked well. So, if you just need a really great pair of headphones for a few months as a stop-gap, these will fit the bill admirably. If you're looking for a long term set, well, I hope you have better luck that we did. I like the look of them & the sound qualityis good. They are pretty sensitive to the touch though. The size is too big for me . Howeve product has great sound . I heard so many good things about these earbuds that I was kind of surprised that they didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. I think my biggest complaint is that when I have my phone in my back pocket, the sound quality of the earbuds is awful. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because the phone is behind my back or what. It‚Äôs even worse if I‚Äôm carrying my phone in my back pocket and I have a backpack. I mean you wouldn‚Äôt think it would block the Bluetooth signal that badly would you? But what I do like is the carrying case and battery life. Those are very impressive to me. I guess I will keep these as a back up pair but I probably won‚Äôt use them as my primary earbuds. I‚Äôm surprised at all the great reviews on here to be honest. I was so excited to try these, thought the charging case and different ear bud options were great. Unfortunately, this sounds like a 2010 Android playing out of a tuna can speaker. There is no bass at all. It actually was unpleasant to listen to because it sounded so pingy. I only made it through one song before deciding they just weren‚Äôt going to work for me. Guess you get what you pay for on this one. Has a random drop in sound for a couple milliseconds but still worth it I use these when my hubby goes to sleep, so I can listen to YouTube videos.  As soon as I pop one in ( I turn side to side, so just use one at night), I immediately hear a voice say ‚ÄúYour headset is connected‚Äù.  I can then walk around my house, get water, etc‚Ä¶without carrying my phone or waking up my hubby. It‚Äôs that easy!!  I gets bouts like of insomnia, so I‚Äôm thankful for these.  Greatest thing ever!! I can hear ok; but, the person on the other end is constantly saying, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre voice is muffled.‚Äù Which contradicts most reviews so maybe I got a pair of lemons or‚Ä¶ I purchased these on April 9, 2021. The buds no longer work on 8/20/2021. I'm disappointed. I have had them for about 5 days now. I use them at work. (Painter) the battery on the ear buds without the case seem to last about 6 1/2 -7 hrs. And with the case I haven't ran it out yet. The packaging was nice a decent quality. Includes charger cord, charging case, manual booklet, and 2 earbuds. The ear buds are sleek looking and pretty discreet. They feel well built while remaining comfortable. They are very good at noise cancelation can't hear people talking right next to me at a comfortable volume even while watching a movie. The sound quality is pretty good better than the airpods. The T6 has nice crisp deep bass and no distortion even at higher volume. Even the charger box seems to be well built with smooth black finish and a stasifying click when u close the lid. Very solid headphones for the price. Anything else changes I will edit. It worked great for a few months and then one of earphones stopped holding a charge. It lasts 20 minutes and then you get the low battery prompt. 2 minutes after that it shuts down. ZERO BASS!!!! No way to make adjustments. Poor quality for listening to music. Okay to use on phone calls. Threw into trash, don't have a small child to give to, to play with. Very disappointed and dissatisfied. Worked great 1st 4 months, then 1 ear bud stopped working and will not charge anymore. It‚Äôs suppose to be a touch, but you have to tap it pretty hard for it to pause/forward. And even then it doesn‚Äôt work have the time and I have to pull my phone out to do what I needed to. Other than that, the sound quality is good, it‚Äôs great with noise cancellation, and the battery life is great. was okay for a month, pretty standard sound and fit, etc. right earphone does not charge anymore and it has only been a month. do not recommend this product. The battery life isn't great, maybe 5 hours, and the headphones don't charge consistently. One will always die before the other. The weight distribution makes them slowly fall out too. Furthermore, when using on a PC, if one is dying and you plug it in to charge, it will almost always cause an audio error that forces you to restart a program and has even on rare occasions caused server crashes.All in all, kinda crap but it's affordable, so you get what you pay for I guess. Really like them but them stop working all of a sudden and can only listen through one earbud, would return them but threw box away It is comfortable Absolutely stellar earbuds. I stupidly put them in when I took a hot jacuzzi bubble bath. Expectably, one fell in the water. In the ten minutes or so that it took me to drain enough water and bubbles to find it, IT WAS STILL PLAYING JUST FINE WHEN I FISHED IT OUT!Solid Set. Would DEFINITELY buy again. The sound quality sucks..I have my phone volume all the way up and it sounds low Great earbuds. IPX8 is amazing.  Nice sound quality.  The profile is too long for my ears and the bud itself too big to stay in my ears.  The best battery life of all the earbuds I have tried.  The rose gold was two tone and dingy looking though. My husband love them. Worth the money Loved it at first ..great sound good battery life..4 weeks in it keeps disconnecting from my blue tooth for no good reason .phone is very close wifi / data signal is strong but every other song it disconnects .also volume control skip etc comes with little to no instruction and the supposed tap sensors seem to only skip songs Great little product for the price. Microphone is extremely low input. Not really usable. 5 months and they are dead, non- responsive, broken!So sad!I‚Äôm 65 years old, not careless!I appreciate possessions and try to take care of them.So, I‚Äôm greatly disappointed in these! First we didn't receive the headphones originally ordered and there was confusion with thinking it was a return. It's only been a few months and initially one headphone's sound felt like it was far away (no matter how much I messed with the volume) and a factory reset didn't change anything. Today the other headphone started doing the same thing. I have it on maximum volume and it is still barely audible. They stay in your ears pretty well unless you're doing more strenuous activity - then I felt like I was constantly adjusting them and they were always pausing or accidentally calling someone since it's hard not to touch the front plate when you're adjusting them. I ordered these a couple days ago and they arrived within 24 hrs of purchase. I've been using them ever since I got them and they are quality earbuds! they fit perfectly in my ear and they are totally unnoticeable while I'm wearing them. I would highly recommend these compared to other earbuds you'll look at on here. Easily paired with my phone with no problem at all. It's also great that you have the option to charge wirelessly or by cord. They don't come with a charge cable but who doesn't have a charging cable laying around somewhere? 100% recommend these earbuds I‚Äôm happy with these ear buds. Granted, I haven‚Äôt had them a long time, but I do use them for a few hours, several days a week and they have been decent each time. They were easy to sync to my phone and provide good sound for both music and phone calls. This products battery life is great and fits perfectly in the ear"
82,"TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender (RE220), Covers Up to 1200 Sq.ft and 20 Devices, Up to 750Mbps Dual Band WiFi Range Extender, WiFi Booster to Extend Range of WiFi Internet Connection",Computers,"Very easy to install. Worked right away but it didn‚Äôt go as far as I had expected.It was a good value hit the money. Super easy to install, definitely not rocket science. The Tether App is an app that is used to make the installation process so easy and seemless, I had it up and going in under 10 minutes.My only complaint is with the 2G WiFi Signal. This extender does not give the best signal so I would not recommend it for someone looking to use it to extend their wifi for security cameras, etc... Other than that, really a great product. Worth the small investment. Works ok, signal goes in and out,  it all depends where you put it Easy to install and now have perfect wifi signal for upstairs bedroom where I didn't have any signal at all before it's connected to alexa, smart TV, and Xbox one S it's not blazing fast but it gets the job done 540 megabyte update installs in minutes whereas it used to not even install at all it would time out or fail 20-50% in to download I had bought this and called to get help setting this up and all they wanted to do is sell me a antivirus for 299.00. So it‚Äôs just sitting on my desk and it was wasted money. I am not happy with this at all. Very easy to connect and install.  Downside is placement never seem to catch internet even when close. It didn't really work for me the vast majority of people will implement this out of the box and thats what its designed for - however its not secure. Quick setup forces several things - If you add a non-broadcast signal to the extender, the extender will broadcast that signal. You can change the name (mask the signal), however it still broadcasts that name. and if you don't have a 2.4Ghz signal, it still requires you to add one.To secure the setup, you must attach to the local unit WiFi, create a local password (going through the parent company website and/or installing an app is also a security issue), then go into the advanced settings to turn off the 2.4Ghz signal, and turn off SSID broadcasting.The reset button works, as does most of the features I tested and use. I installed this and configured the extender. It worked! (for two days). After two days it will connect to my router but will not access the internet. After tinkering with it per setup guidelines and info on TP-Link forum support, I cannot get it to work. I have wasted far too much time trying to get this to work. My ISP told me to get a mesh setup as extenders are notorious for buggy performance. I will do one better. I am going back to good old (reliable) ethernet cat 6. Very easy to set up. It took me 10 mins to set it up. Easy and convenient to try out multiple spots before you pick one. Works well with my netgear nighthawk router. Doesn‚Äôt work. Internet is like dial up speed if you connect to it. Would like a refund really. Don‚Äôt buy Not getting the signal like it says...it's the same with or without it This seemed great especially for the price, but I still can't get a good enough signal with it for Zoom meetings so it's useless for me. This product did not improve internet nor did it affect it. It just did nothing. Don't recommend. Wifi isn‚Äôt good at all same service without it. These don't even extend the wifi 10 ft. And they made my main wifi slower. Inexpensive, makes signal reach corners that were formerly dead spots or fringe areas.  One story, T shape floorplan; others may need stronger extender. Did nothing to boost signal, easy return My router doesn't reach the bottom or top levels of my split level house, so I thought two of these would be a good solution. It was easy to set up but the internet connection was very spotty and cut in and out quickly. I think this would probably be an ok product for people with a single level. I live in a small house, did not improve reception in my dead zone. Also phone kept viewing notofication that it was connecting to usb and transferring info. Concerned about privacy of info as well as disappointed by failure to improve internet reception. Simple to install but unfortunately placing it close enough to my current router meant that the extended signal is no better or worse at distance to the existing router. My current router is a TP-Link AC1900 Archer C9. I had to replace this with the more expensive AC1750 extender which seems to do the trick. The other issue is that I need it for mainly is for security cameras that I don't want to give access to the main disk system so I attach them to the 'guest' network.  An extender like this can only extend one network so I have to pick the guest one. I'm not sure if setting the SSID to the same name as the main network will cause problems , I'll update this when I find out. Bought it because my laptop and setup were too far. Initially it was good I was getting an average of around 40 mbps with the extender which is expected I wasn‚Äôt looking to get 200+ mbps with it.  But now a few months later I literally can‚Äôt even connect to it. I have to unplug and reset it almost every week. And I‚Äôm getting an average of a mind blowing 0.01 mbps. Save your money and buy a good WiFi modem instead. Could not tell any difference in WiFi coverage around the house. Still have the same old dead spot downstairs. Glad I wasted the money If you're only using one router and having difficulty receiving a strong signal when you're at the other end of the house or yard, the addition of one of these will probably solve the problem. Just plug it in to an electrical outlet approximately halfway between the main router and the farthest point that you go to on your property. Set up is relatively easy, instructions are clear, you will give it a name, and it will show up on your phone or tablet or laptop as a new router with the name you have given it. Select it on whatever device you are using and then click ""remember it"" - and you are done. Your device will automatically choose the strongest signal depending upon where you are in the home or on the property. The device itself is amazing. From positives - easy instructions and the entire connection process (really impressive), a lot of options which I would have never expected, night mode and other functions are really precious. The device itself has a really great ability to read the signal from very far. Unfortunately, as far as the device reach for the signal from the modem perfectly, the device does not spread the signal well (small area). It did not reach through the wall of living room to my guest room so I had to put it in my guest room. And even though the LED was orange/ red because of that and the app told me that the signal is weak the connection was still great. So I keep the device in guest room and even though my guests does not have full signal it works perfectly (over 20 MB - which is enough for streaming channels). I couldn't get this to set up so I returned it. It sucks.  It didn't help at all.  Save your money! Made our internet system not function correctly and didn‚Äôt boost as one room away Never boosted our signal.  Not sure if it's this device or our ISP. All I know is it's super frustrating, especially when working from home.v Love It The equipment works but the user shall have some technical expertise to set up and locate the device inside the house otherwise the device will not work as desired. Didn't make any difference with the signal to my Ring cameras while all on same floor level. Makes all the spotty wi-fi signal with your local service provider go away! I needed this wifi extender in order to connect a Rainbird controller, hence the extender works great. How to add to my current network without adding another WiFi net work name . Not to well explained from what material came with unit. The connection is still not great in my home...just a little better than before. It's up and running I don't know if it does any good or not....I think it does I like that its dual band 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz. Not like the one I bought  before  this one. That I though  in a drawer. I like the easy setup  using the app. I wanted to use it in the 3 floor of a üè† where the internet  was not strong and this help fix the problem. I also like that I was not next to the router but on the 3 floor and I was able  to connected and start using the wifi  right away. The range on this little guy is good but it‚Äôs really, really slow. Too slow to actually be able to do anything on your phone. I‚Äôll be returning it for something with faster speeds. I‚Äôm n the plus side, it‚Äôs fairly discreet and easy to set up. Did nothing to improve my wifi coverage.  would not buy again. Works well easy to install I had high hopes for the product given its price and good reviews; however, the product has been returned.  The extender was very easy to set up; it's sleek and inconspicuous. We were replacing an old Netgear extender that always did its job but finally died.  This extender continually dropped the connection to the modem, requiring constant rebooting (unplug and plug back in).. it was very annoying.  While working, the speed was great.  We've ponied up a few more dollars and purchased the rock space mesh system, which has been working great so far. Not sure that this helped at all. The first few days seemed great, then right back to square one and its been that way ever since. I saw this wifi extender on a CNET article. It is a great budget buy. The install was pretty straightforward and it is working well. Did not provide extra signal/bars!  Probably better to upgrade internet coverage. Works good After a few months for some reason my internet extender ends up not working. After resetting the extender several times it only worked terribly before no longer able to connect to the internet. You get what you pay for. My connection to my devices say it‚Äôs a strong signal w this added to my wife. But I still have the same problem going around one wall in my living room, where I lose connection. And I‚Äôm literally about 10-12feet from this device. Setup easily with WPS buttons. I was disappointed because the signal strength did not change, then I realized you must enter the password in the laptop, kindle, etc. for your router with the ""ext"" letters after the router name. It creates a separate ssid port. and increase the range to cover the whole back yard picnic area. No big difference before/after using this extender. I recommend getting mesh wifi if at all possible. Wouldn‚Äôt connect This is satisfactory for what it is.  It lasted us about 2 years before we opted to get an AX1800 router that was able to cover the whole house.That said, the most disappointing thing about this device is the drop in bandwidth and we tried to configure this device in all different kind of ways.  We even got a TP-link router (A6 and C7) that support OneMesh and while we got excited we could repurpose this range extender, we were far from impressed and it is pretty much e-waste at this point.I would recommend investing in a more powerful stand alone router like we did or going with an out-of-the-box 2 or 3+ node mesh system. The signal for the 2ghz band is strong enough, but on both networks I have plugged these into, the 5 ghz band is weaker than the source, even standing next to it. I can use my existing WiFi anywhere in my house.  I wanted to extend it to an outside area.  I had to plug in the extender no more than line of sight 20 feet away to get an acceptable signal to it.  Any further and the signal was poor.  The transmitted range is not much better.  I can not extend my WiFi range if I have to be that close to the WiFi Router.  Not a very useful device.  I would not recommend it. Once installed we went from about 35/15 speed down to 3/1, so it actually REDUCED our internet speed by 90%. Some people seem to have good results but for me it went back as a return. It doesn't work! Easy to set up Simple to install and range is excellent, definitely worth the money...very pleased. Did not magnify my Wi-Fi signal that much; can't really tell the difference before I got this extender. Works with my xfinity. No issues It‚Äôs a good product and it‚Äôs hard to process!! But it‚Äôs awesome when you get it working!!! I love it!!!!üíØüôè‚úäüéºüçÄüá∫üá∏üåçüî®‚ô•Ô∏è The device does its job, but not well. I'm using it to extend the range of my Archer A7, which is a gigabit router. However, this is not a gigabit device, so it will already slow down the max speed. Once you factor in distance and the second-hand wifi, I got at most half the speed of my primary router.Set was was easy, except it only worked as a repeater rather than a Onemesh system. I didn't realize I had to upgrade my Archer A7 firmware first. Once I upgraded, Onemesh worked fine and combined all the networks into one.I would not recommend using this to extend wifi into a primary device like a laptop. You're not going to get great speeds for video conferencing of streaming. However, this would be great for extending wifi to low-bandwith devices like wireless printers, wifi speakers, smart thermostats, etc. This device is more for extending range over preserving speed.For faster speed, I would either get a better router with better range, or a dedicated mesh system where the router and repeater are equal quality. It may be a good product, but it is not one for those who lack, or are not tech savvy. I purchased this product several weeks ago, tried to install it, ran into problems installing with no where to go for help. It's sitting on the ""by"" ... regrettably, not in use, so I've spent $20+ dollars, and have not been able to extend my wifi. It probably would work, but there is no 800# to be able to speak with anyone, and I was not successful in contacting anyone who could heip me install it. This repeater was inexpensive, but works great. I am happy with it for sure. You have to make an online account with the manufacturer to set it up.  What kind of garbage is that? This product is great.My daughter was unable to go online when she‚Äôs in her bedroom. Upon setting this up, she got immediate WiFi service.We didn‚Äôt even need tech support. So easy to install. This was so easy to install. Perfect instructions. 5-10 mins to install. Already hooked up 6 devices to the booster and there is no lagging when playing video games Was hoping to get some good internet behind the doors of the house but nope, not strong enoughVery sad I believe it's helping my cell phone coverage in bedroom. if you don't own a smartphone or I-pad, you cannot download the Tether app you need to set this up, which makes it useless...had to return it. Plugged it in at 60 feet, 40 feet, it works at 20 feet. Only bought it because  I had 15 smart lightbulbs that wouldn't work after my router was fried during an electrical storm. Was recommended to buy this. Has it worked? None of my light bulbs  work, so no, don't buy it for this Needed additional power for WiFi, does the job well.  No more dead spot int the home.  Easy to connect. The WiFi extender needs to be fairly close to the router or the light will turn red meaning it‚Äôs too far away from the router. Other than that it‚Äôs as described easy installation easy instructions and works. Do not work in my house, with my router. It was very easy to set up. U do have to download the app. I am happy with it. Like it so far, not bad for the price Even while consistently plugged in an no router issues, this device has a mind of its own. It will indicate all working lights per the instructions, it doesn't actually put out a wifi signal even when standing right next to it. So got it cuz my tablet gets 1-5 and highest is 6mps im suppose to get up to 450mps on 2g and it's always dropping was getting fed up so I caved and got this its truly very easy and straightforward to set up with app my wifi signal is best its ever been and cuz of the better signal my speed has gone from 6mps to 65mps I can actually watch YouTube with no stopping every 4-5 secs My experience is that this extender is worthless. Set up was easy. All my devices connect to it easily. That problem is that it doesn‚Äôt extend my WiFi signal! I get better coverage from my source router (Apple airport) on the first floor, when I‚Äôm on the third floor, and the extender is operating directly below me on the second floor. I purchased this extender mainly for my Ring doorbell.  My house is brick and the doorbell app stated that the wifi signal was weak, this extender solved the problem.  The set up was easy and fastUpdate 7/22/2021: After 2 months this extender stopped working.  I tried to relink it to my network, but it failed so I purchased a more expensive model. I bought two of these and placed them around a two story house using the Tether App to locate the best positions. Using the OneMesh service with an Archer A7 router, there is now full signal nearly everywhere in the house.However, this comes at the cost of half bandwidth. 200mbps down from the main router, but if a device connects to the extender, it cuts the speed in half to about 70-120mbps. Tested using speedofme and speedtest by ookla. I feel this should be something stated clearly. Mildly annoyed there aren't many reviews mentioning this and I had to go to reddit to find other people noticing this. For the relatively cheap price, I wasn't expecting a seamless extension of the network, but half speed?It's a choice between a stable connection with slower speeds or keep low signal at higher speeds. Works but not all the time some times it sucks butt but sometimes it good it highjacked another computer in the house. Finally I have now a wifi in my backyard. Pretty simple and easy to understand and install. It took me like 10 minutes to figure out . Installed within a minute. Was very easy. Just repeats the signal and adds a new SSID with the name of your wifi and ext on the end of it. Uses same password. I now have wifi throughout the house! I bought this because I was having connection issues with my router, mind you I only have a 900 sqft apartment. The extender did not help. It works great and no flaw till date. It didn't work as well as we had anticipated. Not just plug in and use as read in previous reviews. This is not compatible with our router. You also need to download an app to set up your network. I was unsuccessful in getting the wifi to connect only to to some research and discovering the incompatibility. It should have a list of compatible routers. This worked fine for a month or two, then started needing to be cycled regularly in order to get internet. Now even after repeated factory resets it won't relay any wifi signal and it's out of the return window. Utter garbage, avoid this like the plague. It has a strong, steady signal.  I had to use the manual sync with my Arris router, the app didn‚Äôt sync it and the webpage was worthless, but so far it‚Äôs working fine‚ÄîI bought a second one if that means anything to you. Used this to increase the signal for my door bell. Works great an was fairly easy on o set up Lights come on as if it works.  I was buying it to strengthen my alarm system wifi to outside. So when i set it up i wasn't sure if it was working.  I should've read the reviews And tested it on my fire stick.  I missed the time to send it back.  Now I'm trying to setup the fire stick against the extender and the connection didnt work.  I should've tested that from the beginning.  Testing the fire stick on the extender is the fastest way to know if it's working.  I wish i could get my money back Can‚Äôt be beat for the $$. Easy install and works as advertised as an adjunct to the mediocre router provided by Comcast. Routers from Comcast are at the very low-end and provide minimal wi-fi coverage. Hey, I spend $2400/yr. w/Comcast; not good value for what I get and I have to pay additional $$ to get wi-fi coverage on my back porch. I‚Äôm dumping this set-up soon. Works great with wifi reception Did not see much difference I have a 6000 sq ft home. Using multiple of these does not work. Excellent I liked it too if the lowest value of a great quality works perfectly. Works well, but a bitch to setup. Had to get Tech Support and it still took a while to get started. Worth the purchase. Signal does not fade as much as before. Improved picture. See rating My phone connects to the WiFi extender but there's no connection. I do not recommend. Works ok, but doesn‚Äôt extend the range that much. I bought it to extend the WiFi range to my patio but when I go out, the strength is about equal to the output from my router. I was looking for more consistency. Product does not do anything. Waste of money. Did not improve wifi signal in any way whatsoever. Had to trash it. Buy from a reputable company instead trust me It took me an hour and a half to realize that I had to disable MAC filtering on my router because this thing did not give me the MAC address of the Wi-Fi signal. It gave me the MAC address of the ethernet port on the bottom. Once I disabled MAC filtering I was able to obtain the MAC address of the Wi-Fi signal from this extender. I then entered that MAC address into my router‚Äôs allowed devices, re-enabled MAC filtering and everything seems to be working OK. And as others have noted this is not necessarily a direct repeater because it creates its own network with your original network suffixed with an _EXT. I hope my pain and suffering saves somebody some time and aggravation you are welcome. This doesAbsolutely nothing to extended our homeWifi Doesn‚Äôt work Received it in a timely manner but when I plugged it in I got it working in  thain five minutes but didn‚Äôt have the range it should have I called tech-support they were kind hesitant why I didn‚Äôt get the range,They explained me that there‚Äôs many obstacles that it could be facing to get me the service I expecting just had some digestion but I already move the router closer there is no walls in between the wall the wall no pause But I still kept it and I ordered another one for the other end of the house my house is only 1300 ft.¬≤ so I don‚Äôt know what the problem is there but that everything works fine maybe I should‚Äôve bought a different one thanI got it working in a matter  five minutes , insulation was easy , ending up buying a second one to cover the rest of my house I‚Äôm using the Comcast router Wi-Fi unit the high end so don‚Äôt get it still but there‚Äôs only one wall and it‚Äôs a sheet rock wall with no insulation in between the router and the first one I bought the second one I got full coverage from the front house to the back of the house thank you guys for listening bye tech support just gave me possible cause that I did not get range it stated. I purchased the ""TP-LINK RE220"" to be used in my garage to extend my WIFI signal BUT after setting it up next to the router and then plugging it into a outlet in the garage I could NOT tell any difference on the devices that I use such as my SURFACE PC, SAMSUNG TABLETS, and a WIFI ADAPTER for my RAINBIRD  CONTROLLER.  Just to be clear ALL the LEDS on the TP-LINK are showing as described in the setup instructions....  I really do think this is a great product if only I could find out if it is working... Does not work well with vpn networks No issues. Installed easily and extended my wifi signal. Easy setup and works as advertised. Instructions were confusing. So much of them didn‚Äôt apply. Good extender works good no complaints Feels like a waste of money: my internet connection is still not great. Keep dropping off zoom. As I transitioned to working from home the laptop I was assigned did not have a great WiFi signal.  I bought this extender and it was easy to install.  I used the ethernet cord option and it does the job.  Not the best in terms of speed but it is reliable. Could be user error, but it seems that rather than being helpful, this actually made the internet slower and less consistent.  We turned it off after a few days. This was easy to set up and works great. I have it outside on my covered porch for a few months so far and it works great. Does'nt seem to help. It is two years after the fact but thought I‚Äôd leave a review anyway. If you‚Äôre considering buying this device in 2021, just forget it! Find something else. I purchased this exactly two years ago to extend my Xfinity Wi-Fi with little knowledge of what I was doing and what I should look out for in the process.I can‚Äôt comment specifically on install other than to say I don‚Äôt remember it giving me that much of an issue. I usually remember the devices that gave me a headache, this wasn‚Äôt one of them.What I can say is that TODAY, I am more informed about invasion of privacy and poor wifi speeds. Hindsight is 20/20 but I feel like a fool just blindly checking boxes just to install a device to improve my WiFi. For the past 18 months I‚Äôve been getting more and more spam calls to my phones, specifically my cell which makes me wonder about what I gave up when I opted in to using this device on my network. Listen to the other reviewers when they say do not swap your privacy for the perceived benefit of a device.But even if you don‚Äôt care about your data and privacy (which I would argue that you should but ok, to each her own), just as relevant, this thing doesn‚Äôt improve much. As a matter of fact, you may be decreasing your wifi speeds by tacking this on to your home network and creating an additional network subpar at best. I have 800 mbps service to my Xfi gateway and can get speeds above 400 mbps to my phone (floor directly above my gateway). If I try to get on this TP link extender, I‚Äôm looking at speeds a little over 100 mbps. With the extender plugged in but my phone using the Gateway network, I get speeds over 300 mbps. As soon as I unplug the extender my speed jumps up over that 400 range. I purchased this extender to use mainly with my smart devices on the main floor having the router in the basement office directly below. Seemed to work well at first but over time things just kept dropping. So two years later, $20 spent, personal data leaked, all I can say is don‚Äôt be like me. Save yourself the hassle and go with a different extender or consider building a mesh network altogether. I live in a older house (1700 sq ft) that has plaster walls. My internet router is on one end of the house, my kids bedroom is on the other end. We have xfinity internet and we could not get any signal in my kids room at all. Installed this router and now we have full signal in his room. This thing works great especially for the cost. Great purchase I tried setting it up in multiple locations getting closer and closer to the router each time to get a good signal. By the time I got a signal on the Extender I was right next to the router and it was worthless for my computer. Will be returning. Plus, what the heck is up with the privacy invasion? Glad I dodged a bullet there. I've had 4 of these wi-fi extender units, and this is definitely the best ... easy to install, great coverage, good stability. Super easy to set up - just takes about 10 minutes if you are taking it slow.  Definitely boosted the signal from my router which is on opposite side of house.  Very pleased with product and highly recommend! No comments Works great.  Easy to install. Easy to set up. increased the signal in my upstairs to excellent. Even helps on the p-atio."
83,"TP-Link TL-SG105 | 5 Port Gigabit Unmanaged Ethernet Network Switch, Ethernet Splitter | Plug & Play | Fanless Metal Design | Shielded Ports | Traffic Optimization | Limited Lifetime Protection",Computers,"I bought this thinking it would have wan port in back but it works for what its needed for The ""smart"" features are somewhat limited but it does the job and will support VLANs. I would have liked SNMP as well but for the price....just fine. Product does not support Gigabit speeds even though the information on Amazon says otherwise. Works good.If you need more than 5  ports then you need to go for 8 port switch. This works for me  for the price I paid I recently deployed this switch for a client who needed to upgrade their network to Gigabit Ethernet. This switch worked great for a few hours after we deployed it, but sometime overnight died and would not pass traffic on any ports. I got ""the call"" that every tech guy dreads the next morning that the network was down. The power light stayed lit but no ports would pass any traffic (no activity lights). Tested it on the bench with two devices - nope - none of the ports worked anymore.I've since ordered a replacement and am hoping for one that works as intended. I was originally buying this for the link aggregation aspects, so I could double up my bandwidth. Instead, it's more of a failover. I guess it may be my fault a bit, but still this was one of the top results for my Link Aggregation search and said those words directly in the answers. So far it's working and it's a switch.. It was very affordable and so far no issues. Works great ..if you need a network set up and only need 4 plugs then it's perfect for you I have now bought 2 they work great and my 6 year old could set it up I like the steel case that shields the unit better than one in a plastic case. All the ports lined up with the holes in the case. The outboard power supply doesn't doesn't even get warm. And there's an activity LED for each port. With the unit mounted to the side of a book case the ventilation slots allow for convection cooling. It runs cool enough that I can't feel even warm air coming out of it. It's just a 5 port unmanaged gigabit switch. All it needs it to do is give me four more ports to use and it does that well. It's transparent to my printer and notebook computer. No apparent difference between using the switch or being connected directly to the router. Is it energy efficient? I don't know, I'd have to have a different brand equivalent unit to compare it to. So far I have not needed to contact tech support. Just plug in the power supply, then all the appropriate Ethernet cables, and it works like it should. What's not to like? Would have hoped it would last more than 2 months. At this time all I had on it was my Wifi Cam and it did not work this morning. Checked it out on my LR computer and same thing. Unplugged my internet phone and plugged the cam directly into my modem and it worked. Plugged the phone into the switch and it would not work. Had to put my old switch back in just for the phone. The phone does not need my fast internet so it is fine for now. The time to return it was missed by 12 days. For the price the switch worked as intended with zero loss to the network. Great purchase. Plugged it in to the modem as well as the router, wireless still works, no ethernet.  No easy way to get into the switch to change the IP on it.  Hours of restarting and resetting things to try to get them to work, and another hour now on hold with tech support.  Save yourself the grief, get the Netgear ProSafe (or whatever their equivalent is these days). fair price with very fast delivery and works properly This is not Mac or Linux comparable even though the box says it is(v1, v2 is meant to have a web interface). The configuration tool which you need to use is Windows only. This is the second switch I've bought from Amazon which doesn't say that you require a window machine to configure it and I end up finding out when I have received it that it does. Installed this switch to eliminate weak wifi signal at the far side of the house. Excellent user interface and installation was intuitive. No need for tech support. Used a long ethernet cable and it worked like a charm. Did what it was required for however I need to buy a larger unit so will be using the same seller again for an 8way unit Had to return it due to a very very noisy PSU. Works well providing max speed for my internet connected devices.On the downside I was disappointed the activity lights were on the same side as the Ethernet cables plug in and the power on the opposite side. Hard to set up so I can see the lights blinking when I want to check for activity. I had trouble from the very beginning trying to access the switch to be able to program it. When I finally was able to get access to it, it would not hold the program longer than 15 minutes so that fact that it was a managed port was useless Be aware any device you run off of this will only get 100mb download. No mater what your internet speed is. Plug and play I purchased this as a gift for a friend so they did not have to keep moving ethernet plugs around to activate different devices. It works as intended and my friend is very happy. It works, but at the price of an incredibly annoying high pitch noise coming from the AC adapted. Returning it and looking for a different brand, because looking at the reviews shows that this issue is common and TP-LINK doesn't care to fix it. I had two of these and with both, starting day one out of the box, they drop connection every thirty minutes to an hour. Cheap switch, why was I so surprised? you get what you pay for, not impressive. I move a lot of video files around, typically ~5gb a pop, & was hoping this device would give me a noticeable speed increase over my old 100mbps switches.  Au contraire, the most I could see in the best case was ~ 0.1%, and in the worst case (moving 1.2 tb between two boxes, both w/ Realtek 1g nics) it was actually noticeably slower.  This was with brand new allegedly cat 6 cables, btw.  I tried different MTUs up to 6000.  Still no joy.On the plus side, these are inexpensive, small, light, & run cool, but if you're expecting huge throughput increases, you may be disappointed.  Another thing I'm not crazy about is having the indicator leds directly on the rj45 jacks.  If you want to see what's going on, you have to live with ethernet cables strung all about. Great unit. This is my 3rd one. Only complaint is that the plug for the power is on opposite side of where the ethernets would be plugged. Wouldve been nicer for cable management reasons, but overall does a great job. This product came well packaged and feel solid.  Easy to install and worked exactly as described.  I took off one star because the power adapter seems a little sensitive and unstable.  I had to jiggle it repeatedly before the power light will stay one.  I am almost afraid to touch the power connection and hope this does not become a problem later on. Cheap and effective unmanaged switch. Works as expected but seems to stall to slow speeds at times.  Spent a  little time analyzing the issue but found nothing to indicate why.  It was a bargain price and I would buy it again Mail me a return postage to return items. I experience loss of packets on my gaming console that is connected to one port by eithernet while others are using wifi that is connected to another port. Is this common or is there a fix? This worked great for approximately a week. I couldn't get it to work after that...It was cheap, so no harm no foul, I didn't deal with returning it...I just wouldn't buy it again. Keeps having to reset. Why bother with the 5 port when the 8 port is not much more. The management software isn't the best and cannot be accessed from the IP address. Also you can not set the first VLAN tag from the default one which caused us issues. I love that it's easy to hook up!! This review is specifically for the 5-port un-managed switch. It's hard to write separate reviews about parts of a unit so my number of stars may be unfair to the quality of the switch itself. However, the high pitch noise coming from the adapter is unbearable. Amazon customer service was nice and immediately shipped a new unit that happened to disappoint me even more with the adapter noise. I must emphasize that the adapter seems to be at fault. The unit worked fine under normal traffic. I also have an 8-port version of this brand and the adapter does not make such an annoying noise. I've used dozens of these in the past at old networking jobs and they were always crazy durable and reliable. I use them now at home. The form factor is super compact. The whole unit is slightly smaller than the size of the average human hand. It's also unmanaged, so you don't have to worry about configuration or assigning IP addresses from the switch itself. Plug it in, use port 5 for your Ethernet in, and use the other 4 for Ethernet out. It's just that simple. The switch is functional and does what it says, which gets it two stars; however, there is a significantly loud ""capacitor whine"" once connected, which is driving me nuts. This is my first TP-Link purchase for networking, and I am not impressed. I will be purchasing a switch from a different company and returning this for a refund. Was easy to set up. So far no issues. Good quality splitter Another piece of equipment for my job to make life easier. Easy to use, great quality for the price. I have purchased 3 of these now from Amazon and all 3 keep dropping out, I have to unplug and reset it and then it will come back on.  I do not recommend this product! I lost signal and found out that you cannot plug this into another switcher to use as an extender.There are ""smart"" extenders that can be, this isn't one of them, ergo the price. This thing wouldn't work for me. I installed it as directed and it wasn't complicated but it never worked properly. Decent price for 8 port semi-managed switch. My only issue is i wish you were able to do 2 things with it:1) Enable https instead of http for web management. This would help with security in general.2) Be able to have longer and stronger passwords. I believe it currently only allows up to 16 and no special characters.Most use this switch internally so probably not as big a deal, in my situation i was using as a WAN switch to split internet before our firewall, so by adding a static IP i would be able to logon to it. Not much to do once logged in, so honestly not that critical but would be nice to have the above security features so it isn't so vulnerable if i did assign a static ip to it. Makes a high pitched noise. Got 2 of these to use in bedrooms. Way too noisy at night. High pitched sounds slightly louder than a whisper. Will return after the Christmas rush is over. Unit itself is solid build but came with 2 pin plug. Had to buy an adapter! Works as a switch should.  Unbox, mount, plug in and it's ready to go.  I've not thought about it since I installed, which is the best type of networking gear.This replaces a Trendnet that got zapped by lightning.  I can't tell much difference between the brands, but I'm satisfied with my purchase. I just got this in today, and it works fine for the most part, with one minor issue. My laptop was only getting 100 Mbps instead of 1000 on a wired connection. Helps with distributing internet signal throughout my house. It has a tough time keeping up with high bandwidth traffic. My wife and I have both our computers plugged into this switch which runs to our router and it‚Äôs proven to be chokepoint. I will be replacing this with something better. Purchased two units. On one unit two ports failed about six weeks after purchased. This product falls under business line at TP Link. First call to customer service, after a long hold got a recording that every one was busy, to leave a message for a call back. After a few days, no call back, called again. Technical support person makes you do a complete troubleshoot (which under normal circumstances is good), but for me it was a waste of time, since the problem was already identified. After a few days, the exchange was processed, got a return label and shipped the unit back. The exchange unit arrived, TP link shipped a refurbished. The unit manage interface is not working. Called TP Link business, same recording to leave a message. I owned other TP link products and did not have an issue, but their customer service is less than adequate, specially considering this is a business grade item. Returned- cannot get into control it from Mac.  Would have been nice to know in advance Ideal junction between computer, internet source and model railroad digital controller! Plug in & no worries! Connected all my devices with no signs of lower connections. I like these, although they are metal they dissipate heat well and so far no issues. Still in contact with support but nothing yet so far. Fantastic little device. Had to run cable across my basement to my desk and have this split the connection. The only issue I have with this is it took my PS4 from ~600mbps to ~250mbps. Wasn‚Äôt a huge deal to me, I don‚Äôt notice any issues in online play. I have a first generation PS4 so it might be it‚Äôs fault too.It‚Äôs been function for a month or so and no issues all plug and play. This unit powered up once, and then died quickly. Cheap construction. Useless in my small business! Was not able to obtain a valid IP address when I plugged my systems into this device, so the default hardware was clearly NOT ""plug n play"" enough.  Tried using Putty and web browser to connect directly into the device using the default 192.168.0.1 and 1.1 versions but could not get a connection (username and password options never appeared).  I know the process for changing the defaults manually, but since I can't connect into the switch directly, I an sunk.  Allowed Amazon to contact me in the return process but they couldn't make an viable suggestions either.  Product returned.  This is the second TP device that I received that was affordable, but let me down immensely. Happy to have found this switch - simple, cheap, and seems reliable.  It worked right away and seems like decent quality for home use.  Overall pleased. Decent product Just plug it in and go. Super easy. Just a few things: the port that sits apart from the others is no different from the other four, it's just the way the box is built. Also, it's a tad expensive. All circuits are working great and it does what it's supposed to do. The device works as advertised however I found a bug with the software which is small but annoying. If you made changes and save then decide to make additional changes, the second set of changes will not save. You need to reboot the device and then make the additional changes. Works great! It added many more options as to how I would configure my setup. My only wish is that I would have purchased one with more inputs. This 5 port switch is a solid built hardworking box that'll get the job done and keep your network in check. It works great to split connections and run wires to my different hardwired rooms. Works great! Used for expanding ports on Eero pro wifi 6 mesh router. Fast and excellent price. Great shipping. Had an old switch that throttled my PS4 at 50 mbps with ethernet. Switched to this one and went up to >220 mbps while still having my Amazon Fire Cube plugged in. Great for the price, would highly recommend. Its says 10/100/1000 Mbps I tested it the fasted it will transfer information is 100mbps my big downloads from the server took for ever I had to get a faster one Only one port would work at a time so not useful at all. I've purchased TP-Link switches in the past (different models) and had good results but not with this one. I would've gave this five stars if the ports were located on the back of the device, it would've made wiring more easier and looked better, than having the cables coming from the front. Other than that, great device. Really good product & there wasn‚Äôt any drop off in my DL speed when I started using this. Only issue I had was that one of the ports doesn‚Äôt work. Other than that it‚Äôs amazing Works great, slight high pitched noice. This is one of the worst pieces of technology I've purchased. I've got a competitor's bottom-of-the-range 5-port switch which performs better than this. It has inconsistent performance and my Xbox One hates it - regular disconnections from the Xbox server despite it being configured correctly. Also, I was shipped a model with V1 hardware when there has been a V2 model out for some time. Very, very disappointed, not recommended. Gives off a lot of electrical interference- keep away from wi-fi points to stop loss of wireless signal! The pro is that I can split the line from my ISP and get very good throughput.I wish this device had a dedicated input port, it is supposed to be plug and play regardless of which port you connect your ISP, or INTEREnet, to but it does get confused if that is not put in first.I have my ISP going to a wifi router that has only a single out port, but needing more I bought this to split out the single line so I can spread it to more devices for better performance.Thru trail and error, I found that before splitting out, to connect to the router /  internet provider's line first, since this device will get confused and I  would experience connectivity issues. I have my main router connected to this and split out to 2 more routers and a docking station, and it all works good for the most part.If my ISP service goes down, or I have to reboot the main router I use, I have found that I have to reboot this device, and in the order explained above,, disconnect and reconnect all the ports again.There is no on/off switch so one has to unplug  this device to recycle it.So my wish list:1. Dedicated in port2. On/off swicthBut for the price, if you need to split your connections, I would say its very good. It works as advertised. A nice thick metal case and it doesn't get hot. It really is just plug and play! My internet speed didn't drop with this. It's great and easy to setup It needs a manual they work fine i just dont understand why the power plus have a hiss in them i got three all did the same thing. one i returned due being too loud,. Needed additional ports for my network so I can limit wireless connection.  More secure than wireless and this switch was truly plug and play. The ports are on one side - the power goes in the other. Had I investigated further, I would have selected a different configuration. Works awesome for a inexpensive unmanaged switch. very  small but does the job work well and the price is good. I know a glowing headline:) look this does exactly what it is supposed to do. it does it economically, and with no set-up required.I got tired of the buffering when streaming HD programming with a WiFi connection.I had one ethernet cable available and needed two, one for the Roku TV & one for the DirecTV tuner.This did the trick. Took longer to vacuum the dust behind the tuner than it did to make the actual connections.Also, as someone else mentioned regarding the ""Rate Features"" section, why ask about WiFi for a non-WiFi device, and the other items too?The ironic part is that now I could just drop the DirecTV since the Roku and streaming options are so much faster and reliable! ...Won't need this device after all:) I plugged this in and thought the chip in my head was going off. Turns out the power adapter gives off a crazy high pitch noise that animals and people under the age of 50 don't like. My parents couldn't hear it all, but everyone else could. If you have a better power adapter this thing would be perfect. Contacted TP Link, they don't care, so I figure they must all be over 50 there. Very easy to install and easy to use, receive good signal Works perfect! Works as expected.  Arrived in a timely fashion. Just the right amount of features forHome use but not overwhelming like any typical managed switches. Admin user interface could be better but totally functional. I work remotely and this 5 port switch started having extremely poor performance after 6 weeks.  Testing different ports, I see my download speed goes from 500+ Mbps down to 1-10 Mbps depending on which port I plug into.  Sometimes it's the upload speed that gets killed depending on the port.  And of course now I am just a few days outside the return window on Amazon.  Definitely won't be buyiing TPLink again. Searching for a POE switch brought me to this switch and reviews claim this is a nice POE switch, unfortunately this is not a POE switch. Additionally the only way to get the switch out of the box is to completely destroy the box, so that was fun but not worth returning for $18. Should have read the description better instead of relying on reviews and Amazon's recommendations. Lesson learned. Keeps randomly losing it's IP assignment for no apparent reason.  Not correlated to power cycling either.  Otherwise works fine. Works okInterface app does not workCustomer support not greatWould not bother with tp again, will use netgear Be careful ! My two 8 port units came with DHCP Disabled...  and to make things worse, the default IP address was 192.168.0.1 on both units.  This address just happens to be the IP address of my Router/firewall...  my whole network went crazy with ransom dropped webpages and failed pings (sometimes)...  Very difficult to change settings on the units when one has an IP conflict...  I managed to use their configuration mini CD (comes with the switch) to reconfigure the DHCP to enabled...Just be careful...  the switch requires its own IP address... I needed a 802.1q aware VLAN switch to subdivide a run to my garage where I have LAN devices and my cable modem.  This is connected to an EdgeRouter PoE 8 with two separate VLANs for WAN and LAN. For whatever reason, this switch, while configured properly caused all sorts of issues with ARP resolution on my LAN VLAN. Every minute or so my devices would lose connectivity during an ARP query, and broke network access during these outages. Oddly, the WAN side (other VLAN) seemed to be unaffected. I replaced with a Netgear 5-Port GS105E and all my problems went away instantly. As a plus with any firmware above 1.3.0.3 (currently 1.4.0.6) the Netgear has a web gui. It was very annoying to have to plug my laptop into the LAN segment to manage this. The Netgear is the same price after the current rebate.I can also attest to the common complaint about the whining power adapter as well. I love the thought of a ""green"" solution, that uses less power. I also love that it's a gigabit device, with supposedly no setup needed, but...-the autosensing ports (the power saving feature) didn't supply adequate power to my NAS (WD MyCloud) so that I need an additional switch to manage that device.-the http setup page is inaccessible on a Mac, regardless of browser. That means that I can't reconfig a port to supply power without a Win box. All of my Win laptops are glorified netbooks without RJ45 ports. So an ethernet adapter would be necessary to get into the config.So, by going green, I need extra switches and extra adapters. These work great when they work and I expect most work for years but mine didn't. Had to replace it after about 2 years. They say they have a lifetime guarantee and when I contacted them, they said they would help me but that was the end of it. Being a $25 device, I don't worry much about it but I would be more concerned if I was buying one of the big, expensive routers or switches. If they have followed through, I would have given them four or five stars. This mini switch did not pass the full data rate on several speed tests.  Connecting directly to the router port received full speed as I have greater than 150mbs Internet connect.  Connecting through the switch and the data rate would drop to about 60 percent of the available speed compared to being directly connected to the router.  I conducted several tests and got the same results, so I returned the switch. Great Value & Super Quality This is the real internet WiFi splitter , no need to look anywhere else. It was what I need but didnt come with the ethernet cord so had to go get one. All other was perfect. Good product.However, pay attention since I didn't. This is a switch, not a router. I went from a consistent 900-1200 Mbps on my ethernet connection to being capped at 100 Mbps on this Switch. I don't know if my product is defective or there was some sort of mistake on TP-Link's part, but I'm seeing 80-90 Mbps now despite this being a ""Gigabit"" switch. I'd recommend spending a bit more and buying a legitimate ethernet switch. These units (V2) have a terrible flaw where the configuration is saved for only one boot of the hardware. If the unit loses power a second time, the configuration is reset to default which puts the management IP back to the default address. The issue is that all other TP-Link units use the same default address, so after an unexpected power outage, your network suddenly has numerous IP conflicts. Overall, I'm very impressed with this switch's features and wrestled with the three star rating.  You really shouldn't expect more at this price point and so far, it works as advertised.  Unfortunately there is a pretty big security flaw in the web interface that could be leveraged to defeat your network segmentation.  Hoping to see a firmware fix, but until then, just be aware of it and understand the risk.Specifically, the switch IP that hosts the http tcp/80 web interface can not be turn off or restricted to any specific ports or vlans.  That IP exists on all ports and vlans regardless of how you segment everything else.  This opens up an attack vector that could easily defeat you network segmentation.  Since mac addresses are vendor specific, an attacker can just sweep RFC-1918 address space to discover TP link devices then spoof scan for port 80 to discover targets.  It wouldn't take too long to brute force the authentication and add themselves to the money vlan.  It took me about an hour to run a POC with off the shelf network tools.  I'm guessing this is something a motivated attacker would have in their toolbelt.That said, it would probably take a motivated attacker or someone skilled and bored with access to a public network.EDIT:  The best protection you could add right away would be to use a randomized 16 char password and username.  Unfortunately they only allow letters, numbers, digits and underscore up to 16 chars in each field, but randomizing both should at least make the brute force attack more difficult. Item as described.... I wanted a cheaply priced basic switch to hook up 3 devices in my office with a 4th running to a Linksys Wifi router.  For the most part I don't have a problem with this thing.  Sometimes though, and sometimes frequently, it will lose connection to the internet.  When it cuts out it's usually for about 30-40 seconds, then reestablishes itself.  This problem can happen about 2-3x a week, or 2-3x a day.  Devices in the house hardwired directly to the Linksys router or via it's wifi don't have this problem.  It's only the ones going through this switch."
84,TRAVANDO Mens Slim Wallet with Money Clip AUSTIN RFID Blocking Bifold Credit Card Holder for Men with Gift Box (Carbon),Computers,"There‚Äôs more room for a credit card Cards are hard to get out Great product it was a gift for my uncle and he love the wallet, very small and it look very fancy with his box and packaging. fully recommended. i bought the carbon fiber one black. Our dog got after the first one. Until that point, it was sturdy and my husband loved it. It has just enough room for the cards he needs daily and hold a nice amount of cash in the clip. Very difficult to remove cards. Money clip difficult to use Looks great and very functional. Feels durable but only time will tell. I‚Äôve had it for about 5-6 months now. The wallet is bigger and thicker than I thought  I was looking for something slim.  Other wise it seems to be made well enough A Not worth the mo ey and it doesn't hold much. Spend less and get more. Wore out at the fold!  Not very high in the quality department I liked the compartments to put all my cards. the money clip was just not worth it. too hard to take money out when it is loaded with my cards. not enough space to carry the amount of money I need to carry at certain times and I fumble when trying to pay for things. it is nice looking which does not have anything to do with why I bought it in the first place. it is fairly durable. it would be a perfect gift for someone I did not like, just to watch them either try to stuff it with things or fumble taking out their money or card. good luck! that was a waste of my money. Great construction & features. TOO wide Love this one is a great wallet great quality Got this because it came up on ‚Äúhot buys‚Äù section and they‚Äôre was a limited time deal so i decided to buy it for my dad for father days. The quality of this looks amazing in the pictures but it was the complete opposite when i opened it. The card slots are made from a very thin plastic/ bag material. And the outside of it is feels like a plastic bag stretched over a thin cushion. I thought it was going to be like a high tech wallet / durable wallet but what i got a a Canal experience lol. (NYers will know what I‚Äôm taking about lol).Anyway, i hope this review can help people because i saw the high reviews and thought this was gonna be a good buy. Returning this ASAP. Returned it was too big I bought for my husband. He wasn't pleased at first, but I convinced him to give it some time. so far he is getting to like it.  very tight fitting for credit cards at first but better now Doesn‚Äôt hold as much as advertised, but it is well made It doesn‚Äôt block rfid readers Added about 14 cards or so. Like the compactness. Cards fit is somewhat tight . Money clip is ok but feel it is way too tight Too big but I like everything else In my experience it's no slimmer that the bifold I'm replacing. But non the less, it's a great wallet with numerous card slots. I love the quick access slot in front, very convenient. Also the money clip is an awesome feature I have never had in a previous wallet. Brand name badge on front of wallet was installed crooked It‚Äôs beautiful, BUT all the pockets are too tight I bought this for my boyfriend because he hasn't had a physical wallet in years! He hates the bulk of traditional wallets and never liked carrying them around. I decided to get him a wallet because his phone case can only hold so many cards.I didn't know if he would like it because he always stated how he hated wallets....and he loves this one!! So I guess that's a win I bought this wallet for my husband, and was very disappointed with the lack of space it has for charge cards.  He struggles to pull the few cards he is able to fit, the slots are very tight, making it almost impossible to slide the card in and out.  The overall appearance of it is nice, but not practical. I had to try hard to like this but just couldn‚Äôt.I took a gamble on it and it just was not worth it.Center in a beautifully packaged little box, soLooks, I‚Äôll give it a solid 10. Love the carbon fiber look, and the overall design.Durability, unfortunately not so much.It felt very cheaply made. It did not feel as if it would hold up for a long time.Slots for the cards where way to tight, I could barely get my license in. And when I could the stitching started to come apart.I tried very hard to love this wallet, but just couldn‚Äôt. never had a great Wallet, Now i do and i Love it !! Wallet was smaller then advertised ! Plenty of storage pockets, only downside is the side with the money clip is hard to use due to the clip restricting the slots Great to have Little bigger than I wanted when full I like the wallet but the issue I have is that the front part with card slide is too big and doesn‚Äôt come out very easy. I had another wallet similar that finally broke that was great with this feature. Just a little disappointed with that one feature. Money clip is useless, to tight and makes. It very difficult to remove cards If you regularly deal with cash this product in NOT for you! Looks great but very impractical and hard to access items inside. I've dropped money out of it twice now after having a lot in it then having a little bit in it. Drop the money clip for a foldable expanding bill storage Having cash is a little struggle but god enough Good quality Looks good.  Thought it was slimmer. Not bad quality for the money, it's just worth the money  nothing special,  it doesn't match the description it looks more Slim but it's regular size wallet Well made wallet with multiple card holders (not enough for me though). Stylish and even the wrapping looks nice üëç. Too small, I wanted a bigger one. The Travando wallet is durably designed, sexy and slim. I will be purchasing a second one anon. This was a gift for my husband and he loves it. However, looks nice but unusable to me. I was looking for an RFI enclosed wallet. This is not. Also, the number of credit cards it can hold isn't true as there is a big money clip that closes off one entire side making it unsuitable for credit cards in those slots. Meh I usually don't review, but I am impressed with this wallet. I like the thin style and even though it's not like the traditional wallet that I have been carrying for the last 10 years. There is no money pocket, it has a clip instead which I like. It has the outside credit card slot with the thumb thing that allows me easy access to it. And inside there are enough pockets for my other cards and the ID holder is made so that you can easily take your ID out. Last The carbon fiber look is really nice. Unfortunately an otherwise good execution is completely ruined by the internal cash clip bumping up against my credit cards. Scratches them all up and slightly deforms them. Could even lead to a crack. The product is accurate as pictured. It we good for the price Well its durable it unfortunately has major down flaw to it if you only keep like a $20bill or if you have a few in it you have to be careful your money doesn't fall out when you pull it out your pocket and if you has five 20s take one out the clip isn't as tight and your cards fall out with ease I was lucky to be in a store that I frequently use otherwise my bank card and credit card would of been left on the ground unknowingly tred lightly This wallet is the best wallet I have bought. It is very slim and half the time you don‚Äôt even notice that you have a wallet. There‚Äôs been so many times I thought I lost my wallet. It‚Äôs is a very slim wallet without sacrificing storage. I currently have like 5 different cards and I still have enough space for more. The one thing I was skeptical about was the money clip but so far it‚Äôs been a really good and durable clip. Overall, it‚Äôs just a very neat wallet and I would recommend it. Craftsmanship The card space and bill space was more limited than what I expected. However, the quality of the material isvery good. Gift for a friend Doesn‚Äôt hold enough cards It's sharp my only complaint is the money clip is very tight and difficult to slide bills into. It is a 2 hand process that can be annoying in a grocery line. I like the wallet overall. I only give durability 3/5 stars because the material doesn't seem like it would withstand the test of time. Again it's brand new so I have no clue if that's an accurate assumption or not No negatives, just a nice soft leather feeling product. It takes a minute getting use to the money clip; I do not like showing my money if I do not have to. By opening the wallet you show your money. Great wallet if just do not use cash. Too small  for what I need it for  other  than that good quality This wallet is so large that it barely fits in my pocket. I purchased this wallet expecting it to be a smaller, slim wallet. This thing is ridiculously large. It‚Äôs bigger then most traditional wallets I‚Äôve used in my life. I will say that it seems to be made well, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be using it. Great purchase, received on time, I like the quality, seller and product recommended!! The wallet gets bulky when you put 10-20 bills. Maybe most people won‚Äôt have that many bills but it‚Äôs not for me. Nice It was much smaller than it appeared in the listing. My husband couldn‚Äôt use it. Bulky and feel it will break down quickly I needed a simple but classic  travelling wallet.This is it. When I first got it I was not sure I liked it. I never had a wallet like this one. I love it now it's thin and gives you plenty of room for your cards. There's just not enough room for everything. and it's tight where your cards go. It does not hold nearly as much as advertised Too stiff, kinda ugly It is an amazing wallet and it stores everything nicely. Only thing I disliked was the orange color was a little bit darker then the picture shows. Wouldn't hold my credit cards.  Unusable I would never recommend It. It must have been made a country that has different size credit cards The best part about this wallet was the box it came in it was sturdy and sleek looking. The issues are that may hold 11 cards but it's impossible to get them out. And the only place to put your cash is on the clip and it's extremely tight which makes it impossible to get your cash in-and-out it's possible to get your cash in-and-out. It's a decent wallet. It looks and feels good. Problem is you can't fit a whole lot in it. It doesn't take much for it to start bending out if shape between your cards and cash. The money clip is great. The design is very nice. Also had issues with my other wallet getting debri in it (worked in a manufacturing plant) causing my cards to look really worn. This has not been an issue at all. Clip is hard to use, doesn‚Äôt fit a lot of bills. Decent material. Clip too cumbersome, Removed. Most assuredly NOT slim. Thicker than my old wallet and yet less space. Even after removing some unnecessary business cards It's not as slim as I thought it would be with my cards in it. Worst designed wallet I‚Äôve ever owned. Money clip is useless. I bought this thinking it would be thinner or slimmer than my leather wallet. Def disappointed, it‚Äôs just as thick if not thicker. Also cards are very hard to remove from any sleeve or compartment. I know have to remove my wallet and card well in advance in line or before approaching a card reader to factor in the amount of time it takes to remove a card from the wallet. Didn‚Äôt like looks of wallet. Not high quality. Returned it. didnt met my expectations,material looks weak and small size dont fit 10 cards While it may be designed in Germany, it is definitely made in China.  The outside emblem was crooked and poorly centered, and the lining started coming out because the stitching was unsecure.  There is NO large pocket for bills or any other item you might carry, and the money clip is so tight it actually tore the $20 that I put in there.  It boasts an 11 card carrying capability, but I couldn't get any more than six inside.  While I have no way of testing its RFID capability, given the fact that the rest of it is constructed so abysmally, I'll take my chances with another wallet.  Returning this one...... Be side the money clip I thought you would be able to use the regular way to put your money in the bill fold the regular way!! Gave as a gift, he was delighted.  Slim to fit his pocket comfortably with plenty of room for cards. Once you get your card in it it is not slim anymore returned it. It is very hard to get cards in thus wallet. I had to leave out half of the cards I use to carry. As for the RFID protection, my ID card can still be read by the office door sensors while still in the wallet. If you fill the wallet up, it doesn't stay flat.  It opens up into a v, taking up more space.  If you actually use the money clip, the adjacent card slots are very tight, making it difficult to insert or remove cards.  I wanted a small wallet that was easily accessible. This was neither. very tight slots, big wallet, I was looking for small wallet Really loved the look of this wallet, looked even better in person. I decided it was time to get rid of my ‚Äúold man‚Äù wallet because it was getting to be ridiculously fat with stuff that was unfortunately not money. This wallet forced me to slim it down, but still holds everything I needed. Not to bad. As long you don't have alot of cards to store in wallet. Also the way it hold your cash is a plus.  The price could be cheaper. A bit larger than expected, money clip is really tight, can only hold a few bills. Nice product.  Good quality and quick shipping! The styling is nice and quality appears very good.  But I did not find this wallet to be slimmer than my Kenneth Cole Reaction wallet.  Aspects that I didn't like:  no compartment for bills like a ""normal"" wallet has...they want you to use the money clip which I found a bit cumbersome to load and unload bills; if you jam more than 4-5 credit cards into the wallet, then it will be very tight and bulkier than I think a ""slim"" wallet should be. I had to pull a bunch of things to make what I could fit, in this one, and it is still a bit awkward. Definitely not designed to carry a lot of case around. And I had to pick out of a few cards which had room to me this wallet. No extra space and I don't like that. Lol Great wallet , I over stuffed. The first one and And it got tattered an flimsy , but I LIKED IT SO MUCH , a bout another one . A number of cards and ID's do not fit Really not thin. It's standard wallet size. Returning it. To small Maybe I'm just looking for something different. But this item was not for me. Outside pocket for a card is a terrible idea. Inside pockets are layed out in a way that doesn't work for me. The entire right side is blocked by a money click and only one pocket can fit a card for me. The money clip can not be removed or detached. I didn't think it could be. But I also didnt think it would prevent me from putting a card in a pocket.Some of my cards stick out to much. Others are basically lost inside the billfold.The size of this item. Even though its advertised as ""slim"" is about half and inch thicker and almost two inches longer than my current wallet. So this would be even more of a nuisance to have in my back pocket. Really like the style and how thin it gets for all my cards and cash. It's the best wallet I've used. How It decreased the size of my current wallet It‚Äôs skinnier than my old man‚Äôs wallet, but not by a HUGE amount. It‚Äôs well made, nice looking and holds all your plastic. The money clip is super tight and takes a a minute to get used to but overall I‚Äôd buy it again. For me the wallet looks nice but it‚Äôs a little too ‚Äútight‚Äù feeling. Maybe difficult to put cards in and out etc. Could loosen up with use. Like the wallet but thought it had more slots for cards than it does. had it for a week now in back pocket holding up good Great quality! Not for cash . But I love the product ! I have never had a wallet so well organized. Out side card holder is amazing to have quick access. it functions as advertised, but is overall not worth it, I subject just buying a regular wallet. also the material is kind of cheap, but that a given to be honest This isn't leather. It is super cheap looking and feeling once un hand. Don't waste your money. It was a beautiful wallet but it did not live up to its description. I could only find about four places to put credit cards. I ended up getting one that holds 12 credit cards and still is thin. This wallet doesn‚Äôt lay flat like it says, it‚Äôs just as thick as his previous wallet. Had I known it wouldn‚Äôt lay flat, I would not have purchased My husband is very picky about his wallets. This one met all his needs perfectly. He especially likes the size and clip! Bought this for my husband,he liked how slim it is and the style BUT it slips out of his pockets very easily and wish there were more slots for cards and money clip could be better. We could not put any cash inside the wallet even though there was a clip it was too hard to lift to insert the cash and the wallet. Nice and slim Perfect for me. I like the wallet over all, but a couple of the card chambers are just a little tight. Expecially under the money clip, but I'm okay with that. Other than that, no complaints. It doesn‚Äôt feel like what you see in the photos. Too wide for no reason. And it‚Äôs hard to put in and remove your cards and bills in it. Very impressive. Most of my wallets look like an episode of Seinfeld!Thank you so much! Nice slim wallet holds all my cards and it‚Äôs not a struggle to pull any card out but they are all secure. The money clip is pretty solid overall a very nice wallet. Supposed leather is already peeling off on the corners and have not had it 2 weeks yet. Poor quality, returning Did have quick viable access to cards A bunch of pockets, but if you use them, it's no longer slim. Good quality craftsmanship its to tight to full the card inside the wallet Holds a lot of cards but ruins it because it's to tight.. I really wanted to like this, but the front cars holder almost never works properly. I out my cars in it for quick access, my cars is already ruined because the cars sticks to the wallet. It's too tight. I bought this as a gift for my Husband and was a little worried because he is hard on wallets. We have had it since June 2021 and it‚Äôs late August 2021. It still looks new. Like brand new!  I‚Äôm amazed at this product and am so happy I decided to get it for him. Don‚Äôt know about the RDIF blocker, I assume it works well because everything else was as promised. We are very satisfied customers. Highly recommend, especially for guys who are hard on wallets. His old wallet rubbed off CC numbers, defaced his drivers license and was falling apart. None of these problems!  Will buy again as gifts for other men in my life! This wallet is different than the pictures show. There is really no room for putting your cash bills other than a money clip. Not very practical IMO. Wallet pockets don‚Äôt open RFID blocker did not work To big Great wallet exactly what I was looking for good craftsmanship and I haven't owned it long enough to know if it‚Äôs going to be durable yet but it seems pretty good and very giftable It's just as slim as some of my other wallets. I have about 6 cards and my drivers license in this wallet.  Not the slim look as advertised. I like the design of this product a lot. It takes a little bit to break the wallet in to slip out your cards with ease. My husband loved the new wallet after he had lost his other one."

Locating is limited due to the small size of the network (users.) Paid for more expensive version but stopped working in a month.  do not recommend. Overall I'm happy with my Tile. I use it regularly because I can never find my keys. The Tile works very well to help me find them.I occasionally use the button on the Tile to locate my phone. This works most of the time, but it's a little less consistent that using the app to on my phone find the Tile. The worst part is how many adds in tile compared to cube Bought it as I lost my wallet againNot so accurate as expected, could not locate my wallet living room to bedroom and I live in a small flat .In theory is a great product hence why I purchased it, still doubting if it fullfills what they sell 400 foot range, that's a laugh. I actually find this new Tile Pro has worse range than the original Tile Mate i had. I am lucky to get 10 feet away before it loses it. I had it attached to my dog and it get off whilst walking. I did find it by retracing my steps but I literally had to be standing on top of it before it would connect and start ringing. Would love to see actual evidence of their claim! Gave one to my wife, and the other to my daughter.They really wanted to try them since they both are always searching for their keys (or phone).Took a while to get them working with their phones.  They had some issues with connectivity, and something else that I cannot remember.Eventually, they both have given up and do not now use them.  Apparently, it was too much trouble.I cannot say much from personal experience, because I was not involved in setting them up. Love it !!! Now I can always find my keys and my daughters favorite stuffie that she can‚Äôt leave the house without Kind of useless; when you do misplace something it‚Äôll say ‚Äúout of range‚Äù even if what you‚Äôve misplaced is in the next room I tried it on my cat a couple of times but it works only half of the time, even when my cat was on my lawn it sometimes just doesn't detect the signal. Also, the size is a little big for the cats. 120M is too much but if it would have work for 30M only I would have kept it. I sent for a refund. Originally, I found these were too big to use on my cats. However, before I returned them, i decided to give them a try. What a waste. They are not at all water resistant, one died within a day because it was a little wet. The range on these is awful. 400' is nonsense, closer to 40'. I have four cats, they all lose signal almost as soon as they leave my yard. Sometimes they lose signal being on a different floor. Total garbage and false advertising. My cat wanders into our backyard and the Tile is now missing (came off her neck) somewhere in the backyard.  We had recently replaced the battery, but the Bluetooth signal is very weak.  It cannot track the cat when it's 20 feet away. The tile is lost somewhere in the overgrown shrubs and trees in the back yard, but I'm positive it's less than 50 feet away.  Not worth the money for such a low quality tracker. Its all confusing to use. My Mom is suffering from early dementia, so she misplaces her purse frequently Weve been trying to add 2 cell my sisters & I  to locate the larger tile. Ringer is not loud enough& they winter pair with 2 cells. When I really need it to work it doesn't connect and subsequently it doesn't make the noise because it hasn't connected. Great product poor execution. This Tile worked well for a week. Then it died. The key unit is great -10x better than the first generation. The wallet unit is always out of range - even when it‚Äôs in my back pocket. It has only located itself once. Having these on my keys makes my life much easier, when they work.  It can take a bit of waiting before the tile realizes that it is in bluetooth range.  But out of range can mean out of luck.I am also very disappointed with their Tech Support, one of the four tiles failed to activate, I have reached out to Tech Support a number of times and in a number of ways and my requests for help just drop into a black hole.As I said when they work they make my life easier, but when 25% don't work, and you can't get help, the cost per unit just went way up. Handy and works as described and expected. These suck. I have memory issues and misplace my phone, wallet, and keys frequently.  The range stated is probably in a straight line with zero objects in sight. My place is 600 sq feet and finds it about 50% of the time.  Wish I would have looked at other options first.  Also the up-sell for the good features is icing on the cake.  The slim ones don‚Äôt work for wallets.  Do you know that card that fits perfect in your wallet to help you find it? Just don‚Äôt sit on your wallet or will set off your phone. Not accurate on the map and also 8 hours behindTook my dog to my moms and it never updated on the map not in history  until a few hours later, I expected live updates like my DoorDashIt does beep when you press ‚Äú find‚Äù that‚Äôs about it, one day I had it it lost service twice and told me out of range when I was sitting next to my pet Put it on the cats collar and he dips it in the water each time and the battery hangs at the bottom of the tile so it gets wet each time. Before long the tile is rusted and not working. I thought they were sealed a bit better. Perhaps a better design is to put the hanger loop on the battery corner to avoid this issue. Not had to put this to the test for real yet, but when I've tried, phone doesn't seem to connect to locate it unless they are almost on top of each other. For some reason, these go off many times a day in  my pocket, if I sit down, or put hand in pocket. They are easy to squeeze by mistake Trying to get the best and most reliable key finder, I chose Tile thinking it was a wise choice... but oh how wrong I was.Unable to find in which jacket your keys are and you think that ¬£25/30 is a worthy price to pay for in order to save you a minute of search? Then Tile is for you.Scared of losing your keys outside of your home comfort and would like to be able to track their last location down if you do? Look away, or be ready to pay even more in order to do just that.With Tile, what others offer by default (without additional costs) comes at an extra price. A monthly one.Sadly I only found this out once I had bought it. I took it for granted and only a few weeks later having read the subscription plan did I realise this.Very frustrating, borderline pointless. Don‚Äôt fall for their subscription plan and just go with the other brands that offer it all by default without subscription fees. This actually worked for me mostly until one day it didn't.  What happen was that the battery died.  Neither the app or tile itself gives any warning that the battery is low or dead.  Also it doesn't give a warning that the device hasn't been seen in a long time which would indicate that the device battery is dead.I have a tile attached to mace.  I just lost it this morning so tried finding it with the app.  The app couldn't find it stating it was out of range.  A few hours later the mace turns up but the app still can't find it.  I then notice the mace was last seen by the app a month ago so the battery died a month ago and I didn't get a warning. This is a pretty big design flaw for something designed to be found. It works fine. Easy to set up. I didn‚Äôt realize the batteries were low until I went to use them. There should be a different sound the device makes to alert you the battery is low. Also the batteries went low quite quickly for such a small device. I feel like I‚Äôll have to spend lots of money on batteries if I want to keep using these so that‚Äôs disappointing. Great product for people who are constantly looking for keys or cell phone. I like the fact that you can ring your phone from one of the tile. fits good in your wallet. It should not keep asking you to always allow GPS location.It‚Äôs just a small gadget. Some people only use it to find key at home. Why do I need to spend battery to track GPS location? Tile pro is a great product. The best in the market for what it promises to do. However, the price is high. Looks like a cheap device, easy to wear out when it is on the keys. Also most of the useful tools require a monthly subscription. I will buy more if the price is half at least for the subscription. It only works as a getting-warmer/colder beacon and even though you better already be pretty close.  Don't expect a lot of the features on the app to be useful for anything.  The map feature, for example, is completely pointless.  Also, if there are any things like buildings that might block the signal, expect the range to be MUCH less than the manufacture claim. Like less than half. Disliked that ot did not work as advertised. I was trying to find my keys with my Tile(s).  I was a sending right over them for several minutes and with brand new battery.No dice.Also, Tile try‚Äôs to sell you their premium service which does a couple of things that should be built u to their app.  Illusions of grandeur.  Very disappointed.  Happy with my Airtag.  Threw my five Tiles away. good for what i need These tile work just as described I moved recently and could not find an expensive flashlight, then recalled I had a tile on it and found it in a box in the basement in less than 10 minutes. I've also used the find my phone feature successfully. I recommend these ! I lose things all the time. But now that I have a Tile on all my keys and in my purse, all I have to do is pick up my phone, push the FIND button and hear chiming that leads me right to the item I am looking for. There hasn‚Äôt been one time I haven‚Äôt been able to find something using the app. I really don‚Äôt know how I ever lived without the Tile. Fantastic! It's good only if it's close by, maybe under the mess, in your car, in your home, but not out there at a shopping mall as it says up to 400 ft? That's a lie, unless I didn't know how to use it, because my keys have been history since 8 days ago, and Tile tracker app support is very unsatisfactory just wasting too much of our time, and it actually says ""FOUND"" by the Tile Community, leading us on a wild goose chase, lost so much time trying to track those keys, worth $400 - As I know it's my fault for always losing my keys, so frustrating, I finally bought the Tile tracker, Pro? If that's Pro, I hate to see the lesser versions of it. This was way to bulky for a key chain or my small dog‚Äôs collar Have to keep your phone setting to always tracking and affects the battery life.Minimally I tried TILES a few years ago.  They didn't work then.  They don't work now.  They function, at best 40% of the time.  What could be more frustrating?  Whether it's my phone finding the keys or the key Tile finding the phone, I can't RELY on the device to work.  A collosal waste of psychic energy and money.  Don't bother! I always can't find my phone. sometimes it is not able to find my phone if too far. Actually its not too far. My home is only one story 900ft. I put the tile in the middle of my home. but still not connect that well. sometimes i need to press twice. The second time would work. Gotta keep your location tracking on all the time.  Don't need a history lesson on where I've been.  Just need to know where it is when lost. These are the worst wish I could get my money back. Waste of money. They go off randomly all the time. Never work when I actually lose my keys and or phone. Just not worth your time or money!  Don‚Äôt buy Used, damaged, not refunded. I bought these because I lose my keys and wallet often. These tiles have made it so much easier for me to find my things. I would highly recommend them finding tile from phone works all right, but not vice versa - trying to press on the tile to find iphone: nothing happens (the app was open). Constant upselling in the app asking to buy subscription. Draining iphone battery because app needs location all the time. Wish I waited a month for Airtags I love these and I have used them my tile to not only find my keys several times but also to find my phone when I have my keys and my phone is nowhere to be found.  The only thing that drives me crazy is the button on the tile device itself.  If you have not seen these, there is a button on the tile that you can push to make your phone start beeping.  The problem is that the button is too easy to push.  There have been many times when I have been in a meeting and my keys were in my pocket and the keys were pushed up against the button and my phone started ringing.  I have tried to buy a cover for my tile but even the leather covers won't stop this from happening.  If you throw you keys into your briefcase, again, you run the risk of the keys settling into a position where that button gets pressed and triggers your phone to start beeping.  They need to have a slide cover over it or something. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, this is useless as a pet tracker. Tested by moving the tiles outside of the house (but still in wifi range) and approx 45-50 feet from phone (on same wifi network). Failed every time. yet could easily use phone in the same locales the tiles failed to tv remote via wifi, etc.Not recommended. Dog hates this extra tag on his collar but it has been invaluable when he pulls his Houdini events. Good price for it's purpose and easy to set up on my phone. The phone app can find the tile, but the tile cannot find the phone unless the app is actively running. So I still have to use Google to find my phone. Description is a little misleading. Worked great to track my cat that likes to sneak out- until he went to drink water and it broke when it got some water on it. NOT water resistant. Only had it for about a week. These things are NOT water resistant, I tried them on my cats that have been running away for days on end and literally after a few days, it quit tracking. Upon opening them up to replace the battery I noticed they are rusting around the battery. I would NOT recommend these. No way this has a range of 400 ft, like advertised Kool It's already saved me a total of hours if not days of time wasted looking for items. They do not work. SMALL AND WORK GREAT,  GOOD PRICE I returned after a week, really difficult to set up and used. Not too efficient or accurate.  Slow...... probably a google spy following your every move I ""lost"" my mobile phone one day. Eventually and thankfully, I found it at home. Talking with a friend about how stupid I felt, she recommended Tile and showed me how it works. I was so impressed, I went all in. Phone, wallet, and 2 sets of keys, so far. The Slim fits nicely in a wallet slot and, a couple of weeks so far, presents no discomfort. I have another Slim on the way to put in my passport case. When buying, keep in mind the Tiles cannot ring an item out of Bluetooth range. However, the Tile app can assist by providing the last location of the item you seek.Some time back, I tried a similar item from a company that I know to make great electronic devices and appliances. That was the first time I ever had a negative experience with one of their products. Locating an item or a person was a mess, even showing me in places I had never been. That sort of turned me off of these products, until my friend showed me Tile. For me, it's a winner. Works as designed. My only complaint is it isn't very loud, even at the loudest setting. Not suitable for pets not water resistant not good for outdoor use old ones actually work better,,, I have always stayed away from tile until now and I wish I wouldn‚Äôt tried them now. Tile has always been about getting as much money out of you as possible and they are still that way.  I finally purchased the tile pro because you can finally replace the batteries. Imagine my surprise though when I find out that features you get for free with other companies you have to pay for with tile. You can‚Äôt setup separation alarms unless you pay $2.50 a month extra if you pay for the year or  $2.99 a month on a month to month basis. still dead, no customer service. got 2 more dead ones New design is great aesthetically and functionally. Love the option to keep same device and just replace battery. I think the ""premium"" features that cost extra should be included rather than requiring a monthly subscription First, setup was easy for finding keys.  Wasn't working for find phone as I assumed it was using the bluetooth connection to have the app make a alert.  Nope.  Seems the tile uses a private internet/phone connection without your phone all the time.  For their data collection of where you been.  Your phone has to be setup to all their app to run ALWAY in the background so it can communicate through their network.  If you dont allow that the app will through tons of notifications to do so.  I had to turn notifications off all together for the app.  So I can find my keys in my area, but I have to turn on the ALWAYS to find my keys if they are elseware.  Makes no sense.  Im an IT Security Software Engineer with 30 years under my belt, I know this is data collection.  No way to turn the signal off from their Tile to their network so its not bluetooth unless it cant connect to their network.  disable my phone from all connections except bluetooth and it work to find keys only.  I guess our world thinks terrorist might buy it as they lose their keys a lot? I liked the design of the tiles, except after about 9 months the noise quality of the ring is way worse than when I first got them. The GPS still works. Definitely still recommend it, but they gotta work on it a bit. Stop working after two months. I've had this for a while now and it constantly drains my phone battery as it has to check periodically where the tile is. Its a great idea if only it had built in GPS, so that you could activate this from your phone when it was lost. I dont need to use this product a lot.  think before you are going really need it.run out battery after few week. just used it few times. I added this tracker to my cats collar. We could not keep track of her. The tracker does not work at the range specified and the cat lost her collar and the battery died and we lost the collar and the tracker. We still have our cat... We had the the tracker for 2 weeks Keep losing your wallet or keys around the house? Buy this set, you won't regret it. It will not work on my Android phone. Customer service tried to help but after a couple emails they have gone silent. To late to send back. A bit disappointed they have up. this product has a lot of features going for it.......except that it did not reliably work for me.And yes..my Android operating system is fully up to date. yes I paired it properly; yes I rebooted my phone; yes I turned Bluetooth off then back on. .... but I shouldn't have to do all of this each and every time I need to find my keys. And if I'm trying to 'find my phone'  then I can't perform the above tasks.The whole point of paying premium dollar for this product was to relieve my stress - not add to it. I used this on my pets collar.  They might be water resistant, but not much .... my dog had this ruined in about two weeks. It worked for one day. Sigh. Purchased tile to help keep up with our dog who is an inside dog but will occasionally go out in the yard when we do.  Advertised 400ft and that would be plenty if he got out of pocket for a few seconds.  Distance for this to work is more like 20ft if outside, and 4 or 5ft if in side with walls.  This will probably be returned. Need subscription to use main needed futures, like notification of lost and location history. Moreover, no way to configure the frequency of checking of availability of tiles.The frequency of checking is too low, I am 500m - 1 km away when I receive notification that the tile is lost, it is too late for me. I want for example configure the frequency of checking availability like each 1 minute, now it looks like 20 minutes. App does not update the location often enough. If I am home then go to work (30 minutes) then waited another 30ish minutes to test , the app still shows keys last at my home. Not helpful to show keys at a entirely different location. The app had over 60 minutes to update. (yes set up to run always/never sleep)Now, I am supposed to pay premium for the app to tell me when I am out of range? It does not work for the basic functionality.I first experimented with distance. Placing the keys on the table next to me, (echo/alexa on same table) neither the app nor the echo could find the keys. Said I was out of range. Waiting for a few minutes it eventually then worked on both. Tried various random times and distances the best was under 50 feet. (advertised is 150) with nearly 70% sucess on first try. And almost 95% on second try. Over 50 feet most of the time it needed multiple tries, and the sucess rate was abysmal.Sound intestity was pretty loud, I could hear it from about 10 feet away (I have horrible hearing). Worked well the 1st month, but then just quit working. Very disappointed, especially since these are expensive! My husband is always loosing his keys and wallet. Like everyday practically. Anyways. These came and the wallet tile was dead and didn‚Äôt work. I contacted the customer service and they replaced it with no difficulty. So helpful. You have to download an app to your phone to use it. But it makes it so you can even find your phone if you press the button on the tile. So far we love it. It‚Äôs saved us a lot of time looking for keys, wallet and phone. If your wife loses her keys all the time and other various items I highly recommend this no more worry‚Äôs you will be able to find the items missing. Cause trust me we use this once a day cause the keys going missing constantly. If your looking to track a car purchase two. If you purchase one, at times the vehicle may not be in close proximity to another Tile device. They feed off of each other so buy two and place both Tile Pro devices in the vehicle. I usually miss placing my keys and my wallet, however, with Tails, I am always able to find them right the way. Battery died a month after I received it. Doesn't work"
86,Timex Men's T5E901 Ironman Classic 30 Gray/Black Resin Strap Watch,Computers,"Band is to short. I have to put it in the last notch/hole and it‚Äôs still tight. Dim numbers, not easy to read.  Returned it. Came without instructions and no apparent ability to adjust the day of the week. The watch came with no operating instructions. I finally set the correct time using trial-and-error with the control buttons. The watch is hard to read, particularly in sunlight, because the contrast between the numbers/letter and the background is poor. The letters/numbers do not stand out. The wristband broke off after one workout. The rest of the watch functions well. my bad for not realizing this was the black screen/ negative readout, however, the picture makes it look like its really easy to see the time, its not, at all.  even when the indiglo button is pushed its not very bright. I purchased one two years ago but it didn't work so I sent it back.  I received this one as a replacement but now the Indiglo light just failed.  Either I have gotten bad watches from a bad batch or the quality of these watches has gone down.  The link for the manufacturer support through Amazon does not work.  . I have had several of these watches over the years, and I love the functions, like that they‚Äôre waterproof and inexpensive. Typically for me the bands break after a couple years of use, but I can be hard on them. On this watch, Buckle came off first day I got it. It is held on by a small spring pin so I put it back on, but when trying to put it on my wrist, it came off again.  I‚Äôll replace it, but I am hoping quality on next one is what I remember. I have been wearing the Timex Ironman for probably 20 years or more. When the band went on the one I was wearing in September I ordered a new watch. It was not accurate and lost time very quickly as measured by NIST official time. I chalked it up to a fluke and took the band off and put it on my old watch. Problem solved - until the Indiglo died. So I ordered another Ironman. I set it and then checked it a few days later and it had already lost some time. So I set it again to run a test. After just 14 days it has already lost 6 seconds. That may not sound like a big deal to many people but it is to me. Until this (and the one I bought in September) I had never had one be off more than a couple of seconds in 10-12 months. This one is off 6 seconds in just 2 weeks. The Ironman has been so good for so long and now this. I don't want to have to set it every week to have it be accurate! This is unacceptable to me. I've had a Timex iron man watch for years prior to buying this replacement. The band broke. I need an accurate watch for work. A loss of 1 second a month is acceptable.  This one is losing 2 seconds a day.  If you want a Toy get this watch. I've never had a watch  do this so I tossed the package & now can't return it so I took the loss. I replaced this with a Casio Men's F108WH Illuminator Collection Black Resin Strap Digital Watch.  It's a  cheap POS but hasn't lost a second in weeks. Why a cheap watch then?  Cause I'm not spending a lot of $$ on a work watch. I bought this watch for work. I needed it to be rugged and keep good time. It still works but the face is cracked. My $10 Casio lasted 8 years until the part on the case where the strap attached wore out. Meh."
87,"Tracki 2021 Model Mini Real time GPS Tracker. Monthly fee required. Full USA & Worldwide Coverage. For Vehicles, Car, Kids, Elderly, child, Dogs & Motorcycles. Magnetic small Portable Tracking Device.",Electronics,"I really feel like I wasted money on this products. You have to buy a subscription to use it. It doesn‚Äôt show the history of where it‚Äôs at. And the battery life is crap! It hasn‚Äôt updated it two days and says it has 48% battery. Wtf? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!***The only reason this is receiving 3 stars is because Thomas from Tech Support reaches out to me and solve my issues. He was able to refund me and cancel my subscription. The device itself receives 0/5 stars but Thomas is 5/5*** Product worked great! Very accurate. Customer service is great too. Don‚Äôt waste money No Battery lasts approx 3 days.  That is acceptable.  Many times the gps location if off by 3-4 miles.  Which is strange.  Other than those two issues it works great.  Love the speed notifications. Good for APPROXIMATE location only, speed is way wrong, 2 different phones with same app, same tracker, gives 2 completely different addresses. Excellent Loved that it says exact location. Time you pulled and how fast you go. Got a call from customer Service Nia helped great with the warranty. after buying this gps tracker , you still need to pay 20 dollars to activate it. crazy It would be better if it was a little larger for vehicles. For a lost dog it's perfect. The computer maps and reading design is great. The Tracki needs a trail without using history. It should have a box instead of the rubber cover. The battery only lasts one day. Tech support Josh was great even gave me a lifetime warranty Customer support is great. Activation of my device took less than 24 hours after purchasing a plan. The device also has lifetime warranty. Location displayed in the app seems accurate. Too soon to determine battery life. Happy with my purchase. I got this for my cat who has a tendency to roam. The only downside is that, if it‚Äôs near the home Wi-fi, it places him at the corner of our house, which still tells me that he‚Äôs nearby. Not accurate. Lost due to magnet not strong Personal reason I bought this to track my grandchildren at a music festival. It would have worked great if they hadn't lost them. Instead of tracking my grandkids, I was able to track the people that found it :). They were turned into lost and found and they are being mailed back to me. Now I'm able to track them in the mail, as they're still turned on. Next I'm going to try it on my dog. Seems to track within 20-50 feet, from what I can tell.Charm at customer service was great! Product offered accurate location, and offered a battery pack to extend battery life which was great. App is user friendly. Devious lengthy title, so you don't realize it's subscription based. I like the product.  I use for my pet as he often escapes from the yard.  I wish the collar holder was better as I lost one as it slipped off. Awesome tech support This device has SO many customizable features; holy smokes. I‚Äôm definitely buying one for each vehicle. Update: battery like ok and true to setting selected. Tracking does not update as fluidly as expected. Sometimes geo fence alerts are sent long after the fence has been passed.June from Tech Support was great. Haven't used it long enough to evaluate battery life, etc. good service on 1/9/21 Location did not work Works great. Has a little trouble in cloudy weather and in garages, but perfect when someone is actually driving the car. Highly recommend. It‚Äôs really heavy for a pet tracker. The worst thing to buy you need to charge it all the time and it‚Äôs only for 12 hours and when you want to get the app you have to pay like $20 dollars each month ridiculous I‚Äôm sending it back. Roland provided excellent technical support.  I highly recommend this product!! I received this device yesterday.  In less than an hour my device went from 95% to 26% in typical suburban neighborhoods.  I also noticed that the notification addresses were not correct.  I call customer service.  They told me to turn off the SOS, left and right pings.  I was having it check every 5 minutes.  Apparently those notifications drain the battery.  Umm, the defeats the purpose of tracking someone then if they need to push SOS.  Then I tell them about the notifications and she says that the notifications (bell icon) isn't accurate and they have had many complaints about this for over a month but developers are not fixing it. She said the app isn't good and to use the desktop for accuracy.  However, the desktop ""stop"", ""trip"", and ""speed"" features are not accurate per her too.  She said the only that is accurate is the history information on the GPS only, which does appear to be correct.  In all, the app and desktop features don't work as they should.  Plus, you have to turn off important notifications for this to work.  10 thumbs down!!!! This tracker is ok but the battery is very frustrating. It won‚Äôt last me more than a day and if I do every 4 hour updates it will only last 2 days max contrary to what it promises. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to update its location too and I don‚Äôt have it covered with anything so that shouldn‚Äôt be a reason Battery life was very short Ended  up sending product back .  We had ordered two and when we set up the app I realized each tracker was a separate monthly charge.  Might be good for someone only needing one tracker.  Product itself might be good , we didn‚Äôt get a chance to use it much. Very satisfied  very accurate ! Very happy woth this product. We use it in my father's car (with his permission) because he sometimes gets lost. Great!_arleni_charm I like that the device is very small and easy to hide I don't like the fact that the magnet is attached to the tracker with Velcro. I also don't like that the magnet is kind weak. The fact that i would have to spend 40 more dollars for a stronger magnet on their site is ridiculous. To me it's a rip off, I wish I would've just spent the extra cash for one with better quality. I got this device since my wife had to drive/walk to work for 20 minutes early in the morning last year which was dark (before sunrise). The quality was good but not exact. But 19/month was expensive and now I can be with my wife so I cencelled the subscription. The costomur service was good based on my experiance. I am very pleased with this tracker and just received a call from customer service. Nicole activated my life time warrantee. The experience has but nothing but good so far. Set up is simple and the App follows the tracker just as it says. I just received my second one this week. I highly recommend this product and customer service has been fantastic. Vanna from txt support @lifetime warranty for this device. It‚Äôs a good product, just be prepared to charge it often if you leave it on all day Easy to activate tracker, great customer support. Easy to activate. Tech support was super patient and very very helpful!! The item works great. It do what it suppose to do i love it. I recently purchased the tracki which seemed to work fine but after charging it overnight and using the next day it had some issue where it would not turn on anymore.  Tried charging it again but no lights of any kind.  I am an electrical engineer and I know this happens with all electronics, that occasionally some have issues, so I am not worried about it.  What is most important to me is how the company treats me and how they deal with this kind of issue.  That is the difference between companies to me.I called customer support and Vincent answered and within a few minutes they had my info and they were putting in an order for a new unit and including a free lifetime warranty on it.  I should be receiving my new unit next week.  Customer service was polite, quick, and helpful.  Once I get the new unit and try it out I will update my review on what I think of this product and its performance. It is a subscription piece. So I won‚Äôt know till I need it. Excellent device. And very accurate. You have to pay for monthly service to help keep track of a sick person The product was good. Location tracking was pretty accurate. Customer service was great, the representative Zandra who I spoke with was nice and provided great service. Won't stay attached to a moving vehicle. Weak magnet. This device is an awesome price and comes with all the extras to make it work for any issue.  I bought it to track my child while we were at a summer camp.  The only improvements it really needs is a louder beep and an option in the app to send more of an ‚Äúalarm‚Äù type signal.  The subtle beeps I sent from the app to my child often went unheard.  Also, I lost the Tracki in our minivan the first night we used it.  We had to really look a long time to find it.  A ‚Äúfind my Tracki‚Äù alarm/beeping option in the app (similar to the ‚Äúfind my iphone‚Äù pinging) would be ideal. I have not officially used the device. However, I played around with it and it seems pretty accurate. I really appreciate Charm reaching out to advise me of the warranty I was unaware of. I would definitely recommend this item for family and friends who need to keep an eye on all types of valuables owned. Tech was easy to contact and very helpful. Like the smallness of the product. Wish battery life lasted a little longer, but otherwise a great gps product! Tech Support has responded very well in trying to provide accuracy of device location.Location shows in-app on the smartphone but the incorrect address of the location is constantly wrong. Location accuracy is important to me since the device is placed on a bicycle in my garage. Recently had a bicycle stolen out of my garage, which prompted the purchase of this device. It sucks you in making you think its working but in all realness .. Sucks!! Buy at your own risk.. Its very bipolar.. One minute its giving you good accuracy but the next it won't give you nuthin. You get what u pay for. Get a better quality tracker don't waste your money or time!! Can't set it up. Great product, did a great job tracking our vehicles.  East to charge and love the app! I needed this product in order to track my husband who has Alzheimers and  likes to go out in our adjoining acres and miles of woods. I think it probably works fine in ""civilization:"", since it tracked the return of this item with manyupdates on its locations.. Device sleep and not as good as other devices with life tracking.History report is not great with pinpointing location.Battery life is poor. Not good a good device if you want minute to minute updates. Battery life goes within 24 hours for minute to minute updating Junk products, waste of time The app shows false location on phone, the share link doesn‚Äôt work very well on phone either. Update time doesn‚Äôt refresh properly as well‚Ä¶ It does WORK it just needs some software development work‚Ä¶ there are def better options out there. Great customer service but product wasn‚Äôt exactly what I was looking for. Great customer service. Product still needs some work. Magnet needs to be stronger. Tech support & Accuracy Excellent customer service from May.  She followed up to ensure I was happy with my product. Well is good but the battery üîãüòï is no like  saying  other that  is real good There very helpful For my area it works. It does moves about a mile before it starts tracting but from that point on it's right on.  Would I buy another one 100%. Did very well at helping me get the tracki set up and was very patient with me and my lack of computer skills. On several occasions device didn't show current location... when I needed it to. Other than that 5* Decent product, accuracy pretty ok, Customer service is so so, gotta make several phone calls to get things done... I FINALLY HAD TIME TO ACTIVATE THIS TRACK I DEVICE LASTNIGHT AND AFTER 20MINS IT SHOWED MY FIANCE WENT 5 DIFFERENT PLACES WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY SLEEPING BESIDE ME. (IF HE WASN'T HOME IT WOULD'VE BEEN AN ARGUMENT OF ME THINKING HE'S CHEATING) THIS MORNING HE LEFT FOR WORK I HAVE THE ALERT SET FOR SPEED LIMIT AND WHEN HIS CAR START MOVING. WELL HE LEFT AT 5AM AND THE DEVICE STILL SHOWING HE'S HOME WHEN HE'S AT WORK NOW.I'M LOST FOR WORDS FOR SAYING I THOUGHT THIS WAS ACCURATE. SMH NOPE! NOT ALL! Not at all what I expected. Disappointed You have to sign up and subscribe to their service in order to use it. Wish I could return it. I realized after the return window closed. Useless to me Subscription is expensive Summer for tech support was great in explaining details. it  is not on point  show hour's later I like it It technically worked. But I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúin real time.‚Äù Customer service did refund me for my 30-day subscription though. So there‚Äôs that. I only received one instead of two. Sometimes just lagging a lil bit or maybe my connection You have to pay a monthly subscription !! and it is not accurate!!! location not accurate Hidden costs everywhere. There don't tell you about the cellular fee or the accessories required to do the things it claims it will do in the description. Monthly fee I didn't like accuracy update. Battery life is terrible, the device worked for 3 months ish then it went completely dead. Every time I charge it full it lasts around 8 hours. And gps never worked unless I refresh the heck out of the app. I gave 2 stars for accuracy only because it‚Äôs accurate when I refresh it. Other times it doesn‚Äôt refresh on its own. Tech support was wonderful tho. Canceled it right away, no bs.So for anyone who wants to give it a try go for it, but I‚Äôd suggest buy the regular gps tracker that hooks up to your battery, it‚Äôs expensive for a reason. if you're looking for something you can put in your car- It has to be away from metals ( so you cant put it in the trunk )- The battery dies fast even with the lowest settings ( so you have to charge it constantly ) Liam great customer service they called to make sure everything was working correctly and if i had any questions product works as stated. Poor signal. Poor Battery life even with the extended battery. Very inaccurate. Don't waste your time. tracki gps device works really well to track your children and the customer service is fabulous. It's not very accurate on location. Very helpful technical support. Feel confident with our devices. This thing would of been great if it had a decent magnet. The magnet falls right off and the tracker falls off the car. Terrible cheap design flaw This is an accurate tracker... but please be aware that to actually use it, you have to pay monthly. In small print. You literally have to pay monthly or annual services on each tracki device. I ordered 5 of them thinking they were small and discrete and could simply attach them to a wallet or a phone or something smaller to keep belongings from being lost or stolen....the devices were definitely alot bulkier than I expected but then......when I began to turn on device to use.... I found out you had to pay for more service.....on each one...not at all what I expected....Amazon dis a great job of taking back the products and returning my money for them I think for the most part the Tracki  performs satisfactory.  I've found that the satellite signal is stronger at times.  The battery life could also be improved.  All in all for the price, it gets the job done.  The support staff have been very helpful.  The only other thing I would mention is that the app itself needs to be up-graded as trying to cancel or subscribe doesn't work anymore and you need to call in to do so. Kay was very helpful and offered a lifetime warranty. Put it on my dog for a test run and it was gone within minutes. The clip is not strong enough to stay on a collar. I had to rig it up with the lanyard and the jump ring, but the small cord that connects the lanyard to the tracker seems very fragile. We‚Äôre about to be in the woods for a week and my dog has a tendency to get lost. I really hope this tracker pulls through. This thing makes you pay a monthly subscription We purchased six of these because we needed to track packages being shipped overseas.  We tested them first by driving around and found that they generally worked well, though each tracker showed a somewhat different location even when they were all in the same car or house.  And it wasn't the same tracker each time.  However, for getting a general location, they worked.  Technical support when needed was great. I had a problem getting my Tracki to update. I called the tech support and spoke with Yuki. She was great. Haven't really ""used"" the item, yet, but customer support was awesome.  They called back and followed with me exactly as agreed. 5 stars for customer service!Only 3 stars for the device so far, because the app is terrible! Great product luv it was able to keep track of my daughter More often than not the tracker puts out a message, ‚ÄúTrying to obtain a satellite signal.  This may take a moment‚Äù.  This happens even when the tracker is in an urban area with full GPS coverage. I purchased this for my husband who has dementia. It was sending frequent alerts that he'd left the""Geo fence""area we'd set up. Thank goodness we have a camera set up that we were able to see that he was actually still at home. This item did not cost much and works as described. Its accurate and super small. Used it to catch a theif eyeballing a work trailer on my property. I Canceled tracki due to no longer neading tracki, I easily canceled my prescription.  I was helped by Leah Jones, she is very knowledgable at what she does. The product served it purpose - we put it in our son's backpack during summer school. This was one of the cheaper subscriptions out there, and activation and deactivation was a simple call to customer support. Don‚Äôt waste your money! Only lasted 2 days on vehicle and it fell off After four days of hand-offs and no real solution offered to questions or problems, I give up!We use gps trackers to help locate lost or misplaced company equipment. They work ok, but we were intrigued by the low cost of operating multiple trackers offered by Tracki. However, we found that the only time they work is if they are APSOLUTELY in open space. WiFi monitoring is non-functional and keeps wanting us to re-login. Location map only shows on desktop app and only occasionally. I have been unable to determine what triggers the map-view to show or not show and I get no help. The interesting thing is that we get accurate notifications of movement time but no idea where the unit is. When the map does appear, the gps tracking is accurate to within a few feet. Sorry, not recommended for anyone wanting  consistency in tracking anything of value. Had for 3 months and the battery no longer takes charge. That‚Äôs 20.00 in the garbage Tracki provided great customer service It works ok as in it gives a location (not exact but close) and tracks speed but battery doesnt last very long even on the lower settings. As for the speed tracker, I set it to let me know when going over 80 and it kept alerting me over and over when vehicle went over 50 which also drains the battery.  It also kept saying the speed was over 110 mph which I hope to God is incorrect. Doesnt sound right. So that setting is no good. You have to pay $20 a month for the service. If the battery lasted a few weeks at a time it might be worth it but I dont enjoy charging every other day. Ill probably stop the service soon. Please dont ask me to contact tech support. I shouldnt have to. I watched your tech videos and im using like it explains. If I have to call tech support on a prodect already its no good in my book. Update your videos with some trouble shooting. Bought this product after reviews what I was interested in was can it be used outside of the USA, well it does I live on the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. The set up was easy and map coverage has been excellent thus far. I did not need tech support the instructions were easy and if you view the videos available before set up its a great help. Used to track my drone.  Works great. I do not recommend.  product spends more time looking for signal.  It takes more than 12 hours to update the location. I love my Tracki so much in fact I purchased 2!! I would love to purchase a 3rd Tracki however the price just jumped on me.. from $18 and change to $28 after taxes. That has made me sad since I would really like a 3rd. Not for the price. I like the deal I got on my first 2 Tracki's... so the battery is some bull****. Just a heads up. I have purchased the additional box with more battery power maybe that would be better but they cost the same as a tracker so.. uh no. Oh and you do have to pay $20 per month per device!! I was hoping for one monthly service fee but.. I get it I guess. I'm just throwing $20's at this company. Back 5o the battery. It took FOREVER to get even the slightest charge. I recommend using the cord provided into and actual box then plus directly to wall. I found charging from a USB port was not effective, for me. Also hey üëã Tracki folk? Please oh please give me a way to see what the battery power is on the device at any time. That would be lovely and make it perfect really. ü•∞ otherwise customer service was amazing üëè I had a fee dirrr questions. They handled all my struggles well. Lifetime warranty Don't like the battery life, but a good product. May was awesome on helping understand the product The battery goes down very quickly.  Sometimes, it will say my child is somewhere else when he‚Äôs at home.  It takes a while to update.We are not 100% disappointed with it, but not 100% delighted either. Tech support (Leah) was very helpful and took care of my issue. Thank you Leah Monthly fee.... clearly not advertised well I wanted to use Tracki for a while before rating.  The support staff was great for assisting with setup.  I tried calling again when the maps were not in sync.  I spoke to a woman who was very difficult to understand.  She had me delete and reinstall the app.  That did nothing.  I called again until I got a different representative.  He had difficulty understanding my issue that the satellite map was different the the Google map.  I think he got it when I pointed out the Google map had the tracked vehicle in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.  I was finally told that the vehicle being tracked could not be tracked.  Well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.that makes it hard, right?  So, my advice is that this is super good for urban but not so great for rural settings."
88,"Utopia Bedding Throw Pillows Insert (Pack of 2, White) - 18 x 18 Inches Bed and Couch Pillows - Indoor Decorative Pillows",Home and Kitchen,"They are not as full as I had hoped but they filled up the pillow form. They do the trick, just slap on some pillow covers. Great price. These are used on a living room sofa that doesn‚Äôt get a ton of use. They work great with the pillow covers we purchased and look very plump and full. Not sure how they‚Äôd hold up to heavy use but for my purpose they work perfectly. Lack of support, didn't fill the cover at all. Does not have much of a presence. I liked the Ikea $5 pillows I had before better. Nice buy for accent pillows, not as full as I thought they would be, they are soft and fits nicely in a 20 x 20 pillow covers. they cute and small Very flat pillows that do not fill the pillow case Used for couch. These pillows are not that full. There is a note to put in dryer to fluff, and I did - still not full. I kept them but just beware. It‚Äôs soft, fits in a case but not enough stuffing. Like a flat pillow. Looks pretty in the case. That‚Äôs all it‚Äôs good for. I wish I‚Äôd read more reviews. These were flat and lumpy. Very flimsy pillows, and not what I expected at all for quality! These pillows are okay for the price. They are not very firm at all. They are serving a more decorative purpose for me. Make sure to Fluff them up good to get the most volume. I used the dryer with tennis balls then shook them really good. Good for the cheap price. One of the pillows didn‚Äôt fluff up so good. Really soft and not supportive but good for decorative throw pillows. I love how soft they are yet they keep their shape. Perfect for our couch but would also be good as accent pillows for your bed! i was worried when the package was as small as it was but they were just vacuum-sealed and with just a small amount of fluffing they were just as big and soft as i hoped they would be Very small and seems to be all cotton. Not puffy I bought the 24 x 24 size for my 24 x 24 couch pillow covers, but these are way too flat and do not fill out my covers fully. NOT fluffy at all :(  Returned 2 of them and kept 2 (since I opened them) and put them in my 20 x 20 pillow covers which fit better. Still not really fluffy, but fine.  Very disappointed. I anticipated a much more lofty pillow. These are soft‚Ä¶.very soft. if you're looking for a fluffy overstuffed pillow this is not the one...even after fluffing it out it remains flat and not puffed like a pillow So lightweight - under stuffed little pillows. I‚Äôve shook them forever! Put them in dryer on ‚Äúair fluff‚Äù twice and still very disappointed. Will never buy anymore of these. Only for show. These pillows are so thin they don‚Äôt give much support or add any comfort to lean on. Only for show! Really smaller than I thought. Should have measured. Had to toss out some feather inserts from the store because they smelled SO BAD.  These inserts are nice quality and really well packed and most importantly they smell fresh and new!  Will purchase more from this company. Nice pillow inserts. My covers fit perfect and they are puffy and very comfortable to lean on. Very pleased with  product quality have bought several Put them in the closet for when I get the rest of the stuff for my purple bedspread then I'll take them out with the rest of the stuff Pillows are filling I didn't fluff in dryer so can probably expand more. Please buy up 1 size of cover size to obtain bigger more full look. Too cheap and not good for firm support for propping. They arrived practically flat so I was a little worried....they came back to fluffy shape immediately Pillows have no density. Really nice and full pillow inserts. Fit the covers for a professional look. Super thin.  Would need 2 pillow per pillow cover to make adequate. These pillows come vacuum-packed and they never fluffed up properly for me. They are super lumpy and don't have enough stuffing, and are not comfortable or substantial. I will be returning these. The package was indeed shrink-wrapped, but I followed their directions and had great pillow inserts quickly with little effort. Returned Nice and plump and perfect for my pillow covers! Not as large as advertised and not very full. I ordered a second set of the same pillows because the first set was pretty good.  The second set is TERRIBLE.  Nothing like the first.  The second set is light and lumpy and way under-stuffed.  It is kind of remarkable‚Äìthey are not the same at all.  Cannot recommend. These inserts are just OK, not great.  The price was the best part.  They fit into my 18X18 cushion covers, so that's also good.  However, they are too thick for comfort. The cushions don't really give under you and they are quite hard.  I guess if you want back support, they would be a pretty good choice, though. We washed them twice, and discovered that they only get bigger every time.  Also, during the second washing, the seam on one split open about 2 inches, and we had to pick stuffing out of our washer and dryer.  Not too much came out, and I was able to repair it, but just be aware, and make sure you check the seams before washing! These are terrible and flat do not buy! I love them Pillows are not full. Very thin and flimsy and never fluffed up. no to full Not worth the money They are not as fluffy and lack filling Once I placed them in the dryer for a bit, they fluffed right up! Perfect for my pillow covers. poor quality! Poor quality not proper size. Not enough polyfill. They are flat and make the pillow cases that I bought look big. They look like pillows that have been used for multiple months. Great pillows for use on bed, couch or chairs. It‚Äôs too soft to classify as supportive but it sure is decorative and comfortable. Great variety of sizes. I've just ordered the 14"" size, having purchased the 12"" and the 16"" sizes. I'll be ordering the 26"" size as I'm just completing a tapestry of the same. These are high quality, professional grade pillow forms. (I should know, I'm a professional designer of tapestries and knitted goods.) As with most pillow forms, they are transported flattened and wrapped in plastic, but don't let that fool you! They spring to life as soon as they come out of the package and with a little bit of fluffing up. They're exactly sized and well made. They are mashed flat!!! If they don‚Äôt fluff up I can‚Äôt use them Better products out there. Not as full as could be As directed, I purchased pillows 2 inches larger than the cases I owned. I fluffed them up by hand as long as I could, but the recommended 5 minutes was too much for me. I then put the pillows in the drier with balls (did this separately), using hard balls normally used for throwing to dogs, and that did the trick. I am pleased with the result, which comes close to filling my European-sized pillow cases. Not sure how washing would affect them. As advertised, they are great for accent pillows, not for sleeping. Horrible I was totally disappointed in the product I waited the 48 hours and I am still waiting for it to finish inflating but it never did I am very disappointed that I bought this product Too soft and, basically, flat. Not worth the money. They don‚Äôt fluff up super well. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Great pillows These pillows are not very full. Don‚Äôt buy. These pillows are beautiful but not what I thought I was getting.  The colors were different from the colors in my bedroom.  I couldn't use them there.  But I liked them so much and they looked beautiful on my sofa on my living room.  I am happy with them but I gave up on the colors needed in my bedroom so I changed a few items and am okay for now."
89,"Utopia Towels Grey Towel Set, 2 Bath Towels, 2 Hand Towels, and 4 Washcloths, 600 GSM Ring Spun Cotton Highly Absorbent Towels for Bathroom, Shower Towel, (Pack of 8)",Home and Kitchen,"Very good towel overall I bought this several months ago,  I like the color (plum) but not crazy about the towels themselves.  They‚Äôre too small, somewhat thin and have a textile odor about them ...even still after all this time. These are beautiful and wash up and still are beautiful üòç Mediocre quality. Sub or quality. Lightweight. Very thin, cheap quality towels. Can be found cheaper elsewhere. We bought this exact same towel at Dollar General last year when we were out camping in the mountains and forgot to bring a towel. It was a cheap almost disposable purchase which we have since cut up to use as cleaning rags. They are absorbent but in no way soft and thick.When we received these from Amazon and realized what they were; we promptly returned them. After several wash and drys the towels have lint coming off them.  We use the towels to wipe the dog‚Äôs feet off when she comes in. I would not recommend these towels. Great size.  Very soft.  Washes nicely. Sturdy and soft Great addition the Bath room It was a gift These towrls are plush and absorbent and keep their color perfectly! I have no complaints but they are a little on the thin side. These are nice towels but the first time I washed them the washing machine was full of fuzz. I also had to empty the lint filter in the dryer twice while drying them. These are nice towels after dealing with the initial fuzz. These are dollar store towels. Very thin, non-absorbant towels. I get better absorbancy from cheap handtowels that won't pick up a puddle when dropped in it, than I do these towels. They are coarse and cheap. I would not buy these again. A $3 towel from anywhere would be better trust me. Too much lint It leaves white fluff everywhere Not plum color I wanted very purple. But will use them. Color and thickness. They shed and aren't very absorbent at first; but after several washings with vinegar, they became more absorbent but are still shedding a bit. The bath sheet is huge, and the towels are thick, heavy and soft enough. Overall pleased with these towels. Maybe all towels shed, not sure...it's just more noticeable when they're BLACK. A very nice, dark black...score! Worst purchase I have made on AmazonWorst product I have purchased on Amazon. One month later after washing and drying them every weekend, my bathroom floor still looks bad. You have added more cleaning time to my routine because of these poor quality items. The color is good and theyare fairly absorbent after washing but the towels are not as soft as I expected they almost feel a little ruff when drying off. I was happy to get this set. And a second in a different color, which were fine, but somehow the gray ones were immediately ruined. 2 towels and a washcloth after just 1 wash look like they're 5 years old and bleach stained. I have no clue why I liked the green set I purchased, but the brown set is a horror.  I Myself and my wife initially was impressed with softness, thickness and absorbency, But, after only a few washes they started fraying at the edges Great towels and bathroom rugs!!! Love the color of these towels (brown), which are a nice accent to my bathroom walls. Unfortunately, the towels are just not very absorbent. So - nice looking but not very functional.Also, they created a huge amount of lint for the first three months I owned them. I had to clean my bathroom floor every other day due to all the lint. By far one of the worst sets of towels I have ever used. Not sure how this product passed quality control because every time I use a towel from this set, it leaves behind an abundance of fibers. Never purchasing Utopia towels again. Gave as a gift. Nice towels The towels are cheaply made and lose a LOT of ""lint""(material) when you wash them! They also started getting ""stringy""(loose threads) immediately!  I wouldn't recommend these. Had to throw out 2 towels and 2 washcloths due to holes wearing through them after washing. Shocked and disapointed  because they look and feel so nice. I washed these towels before I even use them. Clogged my utility sink with Lint and overflowed it and flooded my utility room. Twice. It seemed as much lint came off it that I could make a face cloth. Would not recommend. The towels and rags shrivel up and corners curl. They shed about 10% of their weight; I found enough lint to stuff a pillow in the dryer vent screen. I got grey and they are a shade lighter after the first wash. I will not buy again. After 1 wash the hand towels started to Frey... don‚Äôt buy these! The color was not the same as pictured Can't go wrong for the money. I expected a bit more quality but, it's great for guest! They turn orange in spots after first wash. I will not put them out for company DO NOT BUY THESE TOWELS! I washed them- didn‚Äôt even use them and they have bleach like discoloration all over them. It‚Äôs awful Great buy My daughter loves them Personal cleansing Rough and snags easily. Fine for a spare bathroom but not if you want to impress anyone. No issues with this purchase.  Towels are as they say. Very pleased with purchase. Great value. Excellent in every aspect!!! DON'T BUY THESE TOWELS!  They discolored after the first wash!  They are being returned! The towels work great. My only issue with them is all the lint it sheds. I washed the towels twice before the first use and the towels still left fabric all over. I‚Äôve washed them a number of times now, and still have the same result. Decided to use them for pool towels instead of in the bathroom. The thickness of the towels are good. The color grey is darker than the ones shown. After one was the color faded in blotches. They were everything I was hoping for. Looking for a little more thickness.For the price the product is good. Decent quality. Not super fluffy. For the price it seemed to be fairly priced. The color option wasn‚Äôt as extensive as I‚Äôd like. They were bought last minute when company was coming and I wanted towel sets that matched and looked fairly new. They did the trick in a pinch. I‚Äôd rather have thick fluffy towels but they are acceptable. Gift for our son and daughter in law... received the towels promptly and they were of good quality My package only included 2 washcloths instead of 4.Good quality though The only issue I have is the color of the towels. They are about 2 shades lighter than I expected. Good value They're okay towels but they shed af... Wash them alone for the first wash or first couple of washes, or you'll find yourself desperately cleaning up all other clothes in the same load for the whole afternoon. nice set I washed the towels when they arrived and they bled so bad that it looks like I bleached them. I got them on time and quick but once I received I proceeded to wash them in cold water with lite detergent, but they faded anyways, also two of the wash clothes frayed. I will keep as I dont think replacing them will change the quality of the replacements. These are red, not burgundy I've now washed these towels about a dozen times, and they're still leaving plum-colored lint in the shower and on my body after use. I've never had a towel shed like this. They are not durable at all. My towels are already unraveling on the side stitching after 3 washes. Cheap towels and cheap quality I didn't find these towels to be absorbent at all. If you looking for a gold color no this is more like a tan call color , and the towels was not fluffy at all hard material. Shed like crazy :( grey fuzz and lint over everything These towels will not quit shedding.  We have them in a camper so they are not used every day. I kept thinking they would get better but after over a year they still shed. They will be in the trash after tonight. ifelt they were thin and not absorbent Way better than I expected. A+ all the way around! I will be returning, I washed them before I used them and they came out looking bleached and discolored. I do not use bleach to was at all. Wasn't too sure about the quality when I placed the order, but was surprised when they finally arrived!  They were even tied with a bow. Not soft at all!  Bought for a shower gift for ny Granddaughter. I love it Excellent purchase! Towels are very soft, absorbent and I love the price! I will be ordering more sets. They shed MONTHS after.  Use them and are covered in lint even after weeks of washing.  Also not as plush as I'd hoped for.  Would have immediately returned had I not washed them all when I received them. I didn't dislike anything about them, I love the color because it matches my curtains to my shower Not really soft at all. I have bought other towels which are much softer. I received these today and immediately washed them so I could use them for guests this weekend. Went to switch them to the dryer and they had ripped all over and shedded like crazy, and now they look like trash!! Such a shame!! DO NOT order these! Live these towels! They are soft and wash up well! I use these for my rentals and they are first class. Very thick.  I lovey towels Received today. Immediately washed them. The towels washed up nicely, but seem to shedd a bit. Also be aware of the smell, probably from the shrink wrap plastic. Otherwise ok. nice towels, they‚Äôre the kind of thicknesss where they get really heavy when they‚Äôre wet, but they‚Äôre the kind of material they don‚Äôt actually scrub your skin. it‚Äôs kinda like washing with a fluffy sock. nice to just have for the price but i wouldn‚Äôt buy again. They bleed for several washes and sluff off fabric for several washes as well Not so bad. Good for the money, but shead like crazy. Decent thickness towels. Looked ok. Washed them and dried myself off grey lint all over me!! Pretty disappointed. Towels aren‚Äôt that thick guess the price is right They were good for the price. Were not too soft which I liked. Wished they were a little thicker! I wouldn't buy these again after 3 washes towels still leave lent all over your face and body Beautiful purple. The towels seem like they will be more durable than the washcloths. I've only used one washcloth but it already has holes it it. Total lack of quality. I bought into the description of these towels as ""soft....fluffy....durable....double-stitched.""  Instead, I got thin, cheap towels with loose stitching after one (1) wash (I washed them PER INSTRUCTIONS before using).  Of all of my recent Amazon purchases, I am the most disappointed in this one.  I plan to give these towels away to charity immediately and go shopping for some better towels (ones not made by Utopia). The color described is not the color I received. I was looking for a dark purple and these are much too light to match my decor. Not put together very well. Never used, first wash and towel frayed. Bought to display in updated bathroom. Too late to return... Everything is wonderful you just need to give us options how long could it take to deliver one or two days overall it's okay When I first washed and dried the towel set, they came out with loose threads all over, never seen anything like it. Good product! I don‚Äôt really write reviews but these towels were such a waste of money its probably cheaper and better to just buy the walmart towels these ones had so many of those connected strings hanging off the towels and when you tear the cheap tags off they tear unevenly and leave little tag pieces connected and I was just overall very unimpressed for how much they were. It took me about 6 washes for the towels to finally stop shedding and leaving stuff all over me! Hand towels and rags are great but they are all the same material and its a little rough. I have washed these so many times and I am still covered in lint from them.  I was hoping at some point they would be fine to use.  I don't wash them with anything else because they get all over the other clothes too. Good product I realize they weren‚Äôt expensive towels soft enough but the absorbency not so much hopefully after we wash them onceThey will better themselves Over the years, I had bought individual towels randomly and individually---if I liked it, I bought it. But I wanted to have a set of towels that matched, so I bought these. These towels are soft and they soak up water quickly. Very nice! Not as fluffy and soft as the photo suggests, but they're pretty durable and have held up well. The towels are not too rough or too soft - I am pleased with how they feel. The color is also really nice and they dry my body well. My issue is that they release a lot of lint. After every shower, every hand and face wash, I have grey lint on me. I kept them anyways because I figured after a few washes that would start to go away, and it is, but it's still annoying to have to deal with it..it falls on my tub and sink so I have to constantly wipe off those surfaces and I have to wipe it off my body after drying up. I wouldn't repurchase. I ordered two sets of these. They are very thin and don‚Äôt absorb. Also, I washed and used fabric softener twice when I got them and they still have a terrible chemical smell. Not happy with this purchase. I really like the softness and absorbency of these towels and will definitely get a second set. I like the color and the durability. This brand of towels leaves fibers everywhere regardless of being in the laundry. I don't like this brand for towels. Very nice and wash well. These ‚Äúdark grey‚Äù towels look more green. Not very impressed. Quality isn‚Äôt very good. I used these as decorative towels. The color is definitely different than the picture. The color is more of a mustard color. Love definitely worth buying Very soft and worth the money ! I will have to order some for myself. WOW those things shed.  The lint and fuzzies coming off of these as they are washed and dried is a lot.  I sure hope this was just because of the initial washing and doesn't happen each time they are washed and dried.  I got 6 sets and I'm keeping them because I need them .  I sure hope they last a long time.  Haven't used any yet. Kinda rough Perfect for my use as I am trying to furnish my place with essentials while I wait until I feel like going out to buy better stuff that I want later :) I bought these towels as a quick purchase as I just moved into my new place. I washed them before using them and followed the instructions. They faded so bad that I now just use them as hand towels. The pro is they are nice and thick and the perfect size. First time I washed them the ends came loose and the deems came undone. Never will order from this company again. DO NOT BUY! Not quality. Washed as soon as I got them and they just tore right apart first wash and by the 3rd wash nothing left but lint. Horribly cheap! I washed them twice using the specific instructions in the description, and still a lot of pilling. The first time I wash them the color fade it out and they look like tie-dye towels. I was very disappointed I thought the towels were very soft.  They seemed well made.  I would buy these again. Had to return due to excessive color bleeding. Love the color and softness. He‚Äôs a hard time absorbing water though. Love rhe color znd look. These towels claim to be 600gsm, however, they are paper thin & have no weight to them at all. I have 500gsm towels that are so much thicker & heavier than these, so I know they are NOT as described.  Extremely disappointed in these towels. Returning for a refund."
90,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Beauty and Personal Care,"Bad smell Smells like old lady perfume. Its legit horrible. My 24 year old gf didnt like it one bit, we gifted it to her mother and she loved it. (Atleast thats what she said) also from what i gathered this is a fake and not an authentic perfume. But regardless this stuff sucks. Its not a bad smell, but just not for me. Not as sweet as i would like. Would not buy again but i recommend as a more mature scent. This is not the real Vera Wang Princess. I liked the amount of Liquid Fragrance thisProduct Contained!!! Fake not the real thing scent doesn‚Äôt last"
91,"Vont 2 Pack LED Camping Lantern, Super Bright Portable Survival Lanterns, Must Have During Hurricane, Emergency, Storms, Outages, Original Collapsible Camping Lights/Lamp (Batteries Included)",Sports and Outdoors,"I will say these things are BRIGHT, but the design is flawed. It is so bright you can't really use it because the light is exposed without a filter in 360 degrees. It is like looking into the sun. That being said the light doesn't really go very far into the distance because it isn't focused. This makes the product borderline worthless. You can't use it close up because it blinds you, and you can't use it to cover a wide area because the light doesn't stretch far enough. I would strongly recommend a frosted lantern that is usable. I got these for emergency situations if the power went out but they are a waste without some sort of filter or a DIY lamp shade of some type. Disappointing. Serves the purpose, but a bit more fragilely (plastic) constructed than I expected. I really wish I liked these.  The light is so bright and compact that it doesn‚Äôt really help you see around the lantern.  It‚Äôs annoying. Not as bright as they would make you think. Looks like a decent product. I returned mine because of brightness. Junk. Led lights blind me and throw terrible shadows. I dont understand how people think they are a good idea. I guess I'm going to hoard incandescent light bulbs. This particular lantern is very cheaply made and will end up in a landfill in no time. For light Ishould have purchased a lantern on a much higher end After purchasing these lanterns for an upcoming trip, I was upset to see that one of the two I purchased arrived broken in the package I received. The lantern would not shut off after being collapsed. After trying to reach the Vont customer service several times for a replacement lantern, with no response, I eventually gave up altogether. Terrible customer service. Bought the two pack. The first lantern wouldn‚Äôt turn off, even when fully closed, and I could hear a loose part rattling around, probably part of the broken switch mechanism.The second lantern had a piece of plastic go flying off the first time I raised the metal hanging loops, the plastic cracked where the end of the metal loop went into the lantern top housing.Both lanterns broken right out of the box.Garbage.Returned. For the money not to shabby Love these lanterns. Nice that you can hang them anywhere or set them on a table. I hung one of them in a dark basement staircase, works great. These are very bright. It is sometimes too bright that it was difficult to see anything. We used these when we went camping. Light weight and bright, but cannot speak to battery life as of yet. Was pleased that the 3 AA batteries were included for each of the lights. They are either on or off.  No dim/bright, no strobe, but they stay on as  you close them, so that way they can be made more dim. Photos very misleading.  Very small n do not put out much light. These are handy little camping lights, but one of ours does not close fully so does not turn off - I had to remove the battery every time.  Probably would not buy again, but ok for the money. So I ordered this in 10m ago for hurricane season and just now got them out for a camping trip tonight.  Neither works; I tried with the included and alternate batteries.  Likely unlucky, but just another reason to try out all products while you are still in the return window! I absolutely love them great for hurricane season very bright and durable light weight !!!!!Great product overall I ordered this and it was nice and bright, and simple to use.  The problem is my 6 year old opened it up and pulled too far and pulled it apart.  The plastic where the screw goes shattered.  It works great for adults if you are careful, but watch out for the little guys.  The second one is working great, we just have to limit who gets to touch it. One of the lights does not close completely so light is constantly turned on... Drains the battery if you don't remove batteries... Disappointed to say the least I like everything! Handy for reading at night or outside use. Led lights are bright. Love the style, easy to turn on and off Tiny kid  lanterns Yes, there were two  lanterns as advertised; however , the first lantern that I took out , to use in the tropical storm that impacted Florida , was missing one of the coiled springs that the battery must have inorder to operate the lantern.  The other or second lantern was operational...thank goodness .  I bought this item for emergencies  .....  wish I could have counted on both lanterns for the tropical storm which was certainly an emergency condition.I hadn't opened the box until I needed the lanterns.... to late to count on a product that was one half reliable. I am unable to evaluate the lights because neither one worked right out of the box.  The batteries used were good.  This light is not a $2,000 camera of great complexity where one of many features can understandably fail to perform properly and the camera must be returned for a new one without feeling a need to downgrade one's evaluation of the product.The light needs to do one thing and that is make proper contact when switched on to complete the circuit.  That two random samples failed in this basic function represents poor quality control.  Now I must go thru the hassle of returning them. Awesome, much easier than white gas. Don‚Äôt let the small lightweight size fool you. There is nothing small about its brightness. Why is there no on/off button? Total garbage. Needed after an over 24 hours outage , one had an defective spring where you connect the battery.  Ready for the hot summer when lines are down or power off. When we recieved the product it looked like it had been opened before. One of the lights will not turn off when closed. Really disappointed that there isn't another way to turn off and on. I like the brightness and led aspect, but ours didn't work and kind of a design flaw. Haven‚Äôt had a chance to use them yet but they are very light weight,  And oh so Bright We wanted some extra lanterns on hand for emergencies so we decided to try this 2-pack. One of the two lanterns was defective and we can't exchange it for a new one unless I return them both, which is a pain --not only because we threw the broken one away--but also because my usual return center is CLOSED due to the pandemic restrictions ... So we paid full price for one measly lantern. They're smaller than I expected. They look bright and I'm confident they'll come in handy in a power outage. Just wish they were bigger. These lanterns, while smaller than I had thought they would be, are very bright and really put out a good amount of light. They are very light weight as well and easy to carry from room to room if needed. They were smaller than I expected however they are light weight and very bright I can't comment on the battery life sincerity I just received them. Hello Too small  but very nice I was so happy I ordered these lanterns. I couldn‚Äôt believe the brightness of this tiny device. At times we have power outages and more times than many, we cannot find a flashlight or candles. When I turned these tiny lanterns on, I said I have to order more. Now just to put them somewhere I can find them when the power goes offüòÇüòÇ Extremely bright, light and compact. However, it is a blue light and will attract bugs like crazy. Never used it long enough to really test the battery life. Ithem is broken Batteries were corroded One worked and the other would not no matter how many  times we switched batteries. I need to send the one back. The one that worked was great, functioned well with no problems. I'm disappointed with the one that would not work. It's a hassle to have to send one back. Very bright, but not durable. Says it will withstand 10 ft drop, but mine dropped from 5ft and inside plastic broke so had to dispose of it Not even a year complete, about 2/3 days of usage so far and one of the lantern dies down! Very disappointed with the purchase. I did a lot of research before purchasing these lanterns and I was really excited about them. As soon as I opened the box to my first order or lanterns, one of the LED strips was not working.  I ordered a replacement. The next shipment came quickly, but again one of the lanterns had a bad LED strip.  Not sure what is going on with these lanterns, but they are not as good quality as the reviews say they are. I got this lantern so we can have a good light source the next time a storm takes out our power.This lantern was really bright and lit up the room even with the lights already on. Definitely not something you want to look directly at.The outer casing is made of plastic not metal like the pictures indicate. Durability and actual battery life is yet to be determined. After 11 days of little to no use 1 of the lanterns stopped working. Very very bright. Try not to look at it. One of the lights isn't working Looking forward to using this for camping great  lights that are very bright and last awhile great for ur money i would buy more because they are bright lights and worth it. recieved lights but one of them doesnt work the contacts inside cause it to flick on and off and stay offthe other works just fine. When they work, they work well. Less than ideal score because shutting them off can be a pain. One of my two units had to be slammed shut to actually turn off and even then, the slightest shift would make it open and turn back on, wasting valuable battery life. For the price gave one as a gift and kept one. good light I should have paid attention to reviews - these aren‚Äôt bright enough. And partial lighting still uses all light but just hides some of the lit LEDs which is wasteful. The LEDs are bright so I wanted to tape some translucent plastic on the sides to diffuse the light but the sliding structure prevents it. Ok LED lantern otherwise. Could be brighter. To small I love VONT products! This little lantern is super bright, small and convenient to pack up. Only problem, one of them would not turn off. However, Amazon QUICKLY refunded my purchase and made things right! Just the right size, keep one in one room, Product information In print and photos for this item indicates batteries are included. My order did not have batteries. My rating of this product reflects deceptive advertising. Will get full use end if August Very bright. Lightweight. One of the 2 pack would not turn off. Hoping it was defective, will be replaced, and will to great. These little guys do their job and then some.  Very affordable. Purchased multiple times for friends and family as gifts. Gives great lighting, batteries last, power goes out or camping, no fire or flames..simply pull up and push down. Grab and throw if you see a bear.. Bought it almost 2 years ago. Terrible. You have to tilt it one sided to work. Don't waste a dime on it.Useless. These are good quality The quality isn't as great as I expected but for the price it's okay. They're very bright and lightweight...just be gentle when pulling them up! Smaller than you think. Kinda bright, it would work for inside a tent, but wouldn't recommend for outdoors. Maybe with like 6 or 8. Bought this for my daughter to use while camping and it worked great. She loved how bright and light weight it is. I really love them BUT they would not stay on! I kept having to close them & reopen them & tap it to stay on.  Great when the light is on but when u need them camping & you have this problem they are NOT so great.  They would be perfect IF they stayed on & worked. That is why the range in the stars Love how bright they are!!!!! A+++++ The picture was deceptive of the true size is my only complaint. The lantern is fine. Not as bright as i expected them to be when outdoor. They are fine to keep inside of your tent, but not bright enough to light up the picnic table at night time. If the lanterns aren't hung up high, the super brightness of the light is very annoying and blinding. Otherwise they are a good value.  Some kind of housing would reduce the glare and they could be used at a desk or table when electrical power is out. Thought they would be bigger. One lantern was defective top was not attached not very good Quality Control. Returned for refund. These lanterns were super bright and lit up our surrounding areas during night time when we went camping in mid-July.  Highly recommend! Like the idea... DO NOT LIKE THRE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES YOU NEED AND THEY SAY, TAKE BATTERIES OUT WHEN NOT USING!! SO HAVE IT HANDY AND IN THE DARK, PUT ALL THE BATTERIES IN!! REALLY!! NOT WORTH IT!! I ordered these to add to my emergency goodies.  They light up well.  I ordered a pack of two.  In order for one of them to shut off, i have to remove the battery.  Other wise the light stays on and the battery run dry. Very light weight and bright! Lights up whole room without heating up the room. Used these during Hurricane Ida!!! Overpriced trash. Would buy again, works great, good value Just got mine and there were no batteries with them.  They look just like the lanterns you can get at Harbor Freight for $6.99 each. Will not buy again. returned product it barely lit upmaybe it is good for children camping in their tents. Was very pleased to receive my lanterns. It is true they are very lightweight, however, when venturing out into the dark yesterday with one I did feel as if the light was not adequate, did not illuminate my walking path ASAP had hoped. Christmas gift can't give review Great design but they didn't work. Bad day at the factory? Not very bright, military grade plastic seems fragile and none of my rechargeable batteries worked in either lantern. Save your money and buy a quality light. After dealing with candles during a power outage, I found these. They are really great! Cute design and I love that you can adjust how much brightness shows. And I don‚Äôt have to worry about an open flame during a power outage! They are convenient, but very very bright.  That could be a plus but the units are missing some type of a shade or cover over the leds seems like as wherever you place these when on, they hurt your eyes as they are peircing! Just what I expected. I'm glad it comes with batteries. The brightness and ease to use These are definitely light and bright but they eat batteries One of the lanterns was damage Lanterns light up even BETTER THAN I EXPECTED! It's a very cute lantern, fits in the palm of your hand. Unfortunately, it literally fell apart upon first use. I managed to salvage it by figuring out the design weakness, drilling a few new holes, and screwing it all together. So, I'm still using it, but... I wasn't expecting a DIY lantern. Smaller than I though! It works well but arrived broken and it was a Christmas present to close to Christmas This product is not good. I just opened the box, and upon putting batteries in, I noticed that the springs to hold the batteries in place are extremely weak, and the physical placeholders for the batteries themselves are no where near defined enough to hold the batteries in place. I do not know who or how one could use this for camping without becoming frustrated.This means that the slightest bump and your light goes out. If you want bright, blind you in the face bright than this is for you.  You will keep yourself and the entire camp ground awake.  Plus no way to adjust the brightness, sure you can slide down the light the reduce it but really that does not work, in your face super, too super bright.  I found it irritating and just plan too much. Not very lightweight if you‚Äôre going for as little weight as possible but super bright, small, easy to use, and good battery life! Very pleased I haven‚Äôt had or used the product enough to give any info pertaining to the battery life. However, it its brightness is great & it was light weight. The issue that I had was after having used it once when attempting to close one of the lanterns, I was unable to do so. after trying repeatedly, I gave up and just decided to do a review. I only received the item the day before & as mentioned used it one time. Had it not been for my inability to close one of the lanterns completely I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a winner but I wasn‚Äôt. If I didn‚Äôt take one of the batteries out of that lantern for certain the battery life would have been short lived. Light is ok, similiar to an old camp-style propane lantern with about half the light output.My biggest gripe is there should be a designation of the led light color, these lights are useless to me, my eye cannot tolerate blue led light very well. Blue led light is not a comfortable hue for me. If anyone is curious i would say this is a 6500k led or even closer to 7000k. I personally enjoy 3000k. Uses batteries instead of rechargeable The lanterns arrived very quickly, which I appreciated as I was expecting another extended power outage and would need light.  What I like:  Compact when stored unexpanded.  Handles make them easy to carry.What I don't like as much:  The LED's are blindingly bright.  As it happens, the expected power outage did not happen so I haven't used them in a completely dark house, but I know that when I do, they will require careful placement so that we don't look directly at them.  That, or MacGyver some kind of screen to shade the glare. Previous reviews convinced me to purchase. Unfortunately the brightness was not what I expected. Is fine for something close but don‚Äôt expect a very wide illumination area. Won‚Äôt return as will use until I purchase something better suited for my needs. As I read in the other buyers‚Äô review, the lumen or light intensity is very poor.It just like a gadget for me.But the product design and concept is great.But the product casing materials like a cheap plasticWill not buy it again.Thanks Great product. I was very pleased I just received them so too soon to give too much feedback. They're nice little lights but I do find the LED far too bright, it hurt the eyes. This two-pack of lanterns came in a thin cardboard box that did not even have the lid taped down. The contents must have spilled out at least once, the batteries and any paperwork were gone. both units seem to work ok. A really dumb way to ship things. Not what i had expected. ended up giving these to my grandson as a night light. I ordered this set right before my camping trip they arrived just in time so that was a plus. Right away I noticed 1 lantern did not shut all the away so therefore that led it to die because it wasted the battery life from staying on 24/7. The one that shut correctly the light shut off and the life of the lantern lasted all weekend & worked properly. Having just the one was a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to using them both it would‚Äôve made the trip a lil bit easier. Very small and dim returned them for a better one When I extended light housing to turn on itFell apart in my hands , we tried to repairUnable to. Not enough light This thing is a piece of Chinese garbage, I give zero stars. The second time I opened one of them to turn it on the lid came off and it totally fell into pieces. I took a chance for the cheap price and lost. This is total garbage and I highly recommend choosing another product. I once heard it said ""only a rich man can afford to buy cheap stuff"". Sounds like good advice to me. ok, but We used these for camping and I love how bright the lanterns are.  However, I wish there was away to dim them. They did their job though! Great product, fast shipping, packaged nicely, and description fits perfectly. Everthing These are misleading.  Quite small,  They are not as bright as I expected.  One of those products that should sell for $5.00.  NOt worth the money. I do a lot of camping. so I was thinking it be a good thing to get a light. that I not have to start. just to open sounded good to me. and it was to be able to light a room. what a joke that is. I would send them back. but did not waste my time. I just put in the trash. it is not worth 10 pennies.think before you order these. there are very good ones out the.  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. it is not just one was bad. both of them were the same. One of the light doesn't close which causes it to stay on. I was not as pleased as I had hoped. I earlier I had purchased a Bell & Howell lantern and it was far superior The product is good but I would prefer solar They were way smaller than expected.  I will now have to find some larger ones as for they were for a gift. Nice, great light but one of the patterns started fallening apart the first day.The light comes on when extended. However, when closed it would slope open a bit and run the battery down.Plus the handles fell off. Used once 2nd time I‚Äôve bought these. 1 of the originals just stopped working but thought they were worth the buy. This time one open a little too easily so you can hold it without it opening all the way. That‚Äôs my one complaint. Other than that, all good. One worked. One didnt. Too expensive to send it back, bummer. Batteries were dead when item was received.  I put in new batteries and the light is pretty bright. The handles appear to be on the wrong end of the light!  You have the brightness in your eyes when using! Did not receive batteries as describe in description and it was even listed on the box. This was smaller the I thought.  Not very bright.  Better off getting one bigger light source. If you are looking for an inside tent light this probably will work. But not as an outside camping light.  The area it lights up is about two feet at most three feet. One did not work at all, and the other was hardly bright at all.  Not really very much to it. 2 days late... One light works... The other doesn't... Wasted time and money... Thanks for nothing!!! They look like what they‚Äôre supposed to look like ‚Äúa knock off of a better product. They are in fact light weight, but that‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt seem very well-made. They are bright at first, but after three hours they have diminished by half. Worthless in an emergency. The light is bright and it's easy to operate and pack.  But I didn't find it that helpful in that it only lights up an area in a narrow lateral plane.  It doesn't project up or down very well and is slightly blinding. The lanterns are super bright and do provide adequate lighting for my needs but one of the two has a tinkling and rattling sound so something inside is loose and I couldn‚Äôt figure it out and as a result the lantern will activate even if opened slightly! If I hang the lantern closed the weight of the batteries will cause the lantern to open a little and this will turn it on! This is very disappointing! The other lantern works fine."
92,"WOW Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo and Hair Conditioner Set Increase Gloss, Hydration, Shine, Reduce Itchy Scalp, Dandruff & Frizz, No Parabens or Sulfates, All Hair Types, 2 x 16.9 Fl Oz 500mL",Beauty and Personal Care,"From reading the reviews, I was hoping that the shampoo and conditioner would be extra moisturizing to my 4A hair, but I was not impressed.  Aussie Miracle Moist Conditioner works better for me and is a lot cheaper. Works nice on repairing hair and really starting to love the brand I was super excited to try this product as it had so many amazing reviews but I found it left my hair very dry and very knotted. I don't see any difference in my hair using these products. Did not feel like it even washed my hair when used Smell is ok. I have been using this for 2 months and haven‚Äôt seen much difference in my hair. Smell doesn‚Äôt stick. This product did not do what it claims to do regarding making Grey hair more silver. The conditioner is NOT moisturizing at all. I am not happy with that purchase! Good strengthening products! Makes your hair soft. Beautification for your hair, lovely fragrance This makes your hair look oily even when washed daily, every other day. It doesn‚Äôt even make a good soap This gives your hair a nice deep clean and then conditions so well you hair is left soft Does what you expect This makes my hair so soft and smells wonderful!! Love it‚ù§Ô∏è The product is very drying of your hair. A friend of mine took it after surgery and her hair is falling out and it made it grows so I bought it. The bottles are too small for the money and you have to use too much to get it to lather. I liked the scent, and my hair is softer and it feels fuller. Conditioner is better than the shampoo. I have been using this product for a month now, I‚Äôm still shedding hair but my hair does look fuller. It used to look thin. I will continue to use this and recently ordered more. I used this for hair growth and less breakage. I am not sure if it worked for that or not. Pleasant smell, cleaned hair but didn't get that softness or anything like that once got out of shower. Just started to use the product. Smells good, my hair is soft. My hair doesn‚Äôt itch after using this shampoo. It must be the apple cider!  The conditioner is the finishing touch because it‚Äôs so rich and full of moisturizing ingredients.  I am 67 years old with natural gray hair and this product really keeps the gray hair from frizzing. Left my hair so tangled. I could not comb through it. I‚Äôve been using this product 2-3 times a week for almost 3 months. I leave the shampoo on for 5min and then the conditioner for about 5min. If I have extra time, I‚Äôll leave it on for the suggested 10-15 With a shower cap. I have thin, fine hair...I now have a little bit of volume and it‚Äôs so soft!!! Also my hair gets greasy/oily quick but since using this stuff I can now go 3 days between washesBonus...my hair has grown about an inch/ inch and a half in the 3 months I‚Äôve been using it. So far, the WOW shampoo has worked great!Only been using for a week, so not sure if the claims of hair growth and such are true yet.  You don't have to use much shampoo for a lather, the conditioner softens your hair and they both smell great!  My only complaint and the only reason why I didn't give 5 stars, is because they sent me expired products, the shampoo and conditioner both expired in October of 2020! I was really looking forward to using this product due to the ads being so convincing that this shampoo and conditioner is moisturizing and help prevent hair loss. I‚Äôve used this product 3 times now and my hair feels like hay after rinsing out the conditioner and very hard to brush. After it dries my hair is very dry. Needless to say I‚Äôm not that impressed so far. My hair is no where near silky and soft. Too much hair fall. My daughter and me lost all hair I was so excited to receive this after reading all the wonderful reviews,  buuuuut this didn't work for me.  Scalp still dry,  didn't bring more shine to my hair,  didn't notice any repair. The scent isn't for me.  Already finished bottle The first time I used this I loved how my hair felt. The hair loss was the same, a lot, but it left it so shiny. The second time I felt like I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the product no matter how much I rinsed. Once it dried I could tell how much residue I had left when I parted my hair. This third time it seems like I never even washed my hair! I still have the same hair loss.It doesn‚Äôt lather too well so I‚Äôm using more product than I normally would this might be why. Giving it one more try before I stop using. It arrived on June 2nd, and when I checked the expiration date, it showed that it was best if used before March 2021. I returned it and they issued me a refund. So I don‚Äôt know how the product actually is but the ingredients that were mentioned on the back of the bottles are known for improving your hair in general‚Ä¶I want to repurchase it but I don‚Äôt know if it will be expired this time or not. DO NOT BUY- this product makes hair fall so bad and causes dry scalp. If you are looking to lose hair fast and get bald spots, this is the product for you! Works well to help frizz. This product is just OK and in my opinion, not worth its price point. I stopped dying my hair about a year ago. My hair is oily at the scalp but normal and not damaged at the ends. While this works well for the scalp care, my ends feel dryyyyyy, luckily I still have some hair oil my hairdresser aunt gifted me, but no, I would not buy this again. Sorry,  but there's no special benefit from this combo.  I don't feel like it's done much for my hair.  I would not recommend or buy again So I will say that the shampoo and conditioner smell amazing! I definitely have notice a decrease in hair loss after brushing. That being said in my opinion it works just the same as your more higher priced drugstore shampoo and conditioner. But hey it‚Äôs okay to treat yourself once in awhile. I feel like you can get the same effect with an inexpensive hair mask. Just my humble opinion. MY WIFE LOVES IT SO FAR SO GOOD!!!! Left my hair very knotty! Nothing like I expected. Unfortunately my daughter and I both tried the shampoo and conditioner but it dried out our hair and left it rather unmanageable. I hade seen reviews where people were pulling out more hair due to this shampoo and conditioner and I should have listened to them. Gobs of hair came out. Hasn‚Äôt happened again since I stopped using this Not feeling the hype. Scents are okay (shampoo is apple, conditioner is coconut). Leaves my hair parched. Bought for scalp cleansing, as mine tends toward oily with naturally curly, generally coarse, strands. This seems to strip the hair of everything. May be great for build up removal on the hair, did nothing for my scalp & just depleted the hair. Left with frizz and having to add product back just to have any moisture to work with. I did leave on both for the amount of time directed and have tried several times. Will sparingly for clarifying but there better and much less expensive potions for just that so won't be re-buying and honestly can't recommend. Seems overrated to me. To each their own. Wasn‚Äôt as expected. Dried the heck out of my hair even though I followed directions. My hair dresser said it‚Äôs more of a detox since it strips your hair of the oils. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you have tangles It left my hair frizzy and tangled. I guess these set of Shampoo and Conditioner would work if your hair is oily. In my case my hair is thin & normal so I do not like it at all. It leaves my hair dry and without any shine at all. Too expensive for not working. I‚Äôve used 10 that I‚Äôve gotten at Grocery stores and works a lot better, leaves y hair manejable, shiny and beautiful just with the Shampoo, I don‚Äôt even need to use the conditioner.  I will be returning these ASAP. I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that would work with my bleached hair. Let me tell you, my hair has never flew so soft, my scalp is so much healthier and my dandruff is almost gone. I use it on my daughter's hair, and their curls are banging after it get washed with this. This is my new shampoo and conditioner, I won't use anything else. So far, I really like the Apple cider vinegar shampoo and conditioner set. I‚Äôve been using it for several weeks now and plan to order more. It has a nice scent, and I‚Äôve noticed that my hair has been softer, less oily, and no flakes/dandruff.  I‚Äôm not really sure if it is helping with hair thickness, but overall, my hair feels healthier. This shampoo not 100% helpful reduced lost hair My hair is very dry and coarse. This product has made my hair very smooth and soft. Would recommend if needing to make your hair smoother. This product did what it said, for the most part. My hair is much healthier and full since using this product.  And, it is definitely not as frizzy.  The smell could be a little better,  but then, it would probably take away from the effects of this product.  I would recommend this product. The shampoo is not good to my hair is getting softer. The shampoo: smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. I have even noticed that my baby hairs around my hairline are actually growing instead of just stopping at 1 inch.The conditioner: Smells good but that‚Äôs about the only good thing about it. Even after leaving it in my hair for 30 minutes or more I still can barely even pull a wide tooth comb through it. It doesn‚Äôt really moisturize or condition my hair at all and frankly just leaves it a tangled frizzy mess! I can‚Äôt remember if I read it with other reviewers but this left my hair feeling oily. It felt this way after the shampoo and before the conditioner. Thought I might be using it wrong because I let it soak in my hair for a few minutes after sudsing. Did same with conditioner. Second time around used it like a normal shampoo and conditioner. Still made hair feel oily. And both times weighed down my hair. If you have dry, curly hair this might be better for you. The return process was easy so appreciated that. Thank you! I like the fell of my hair after shampooing and conditioning. The scent of the shampoo was nice for being apple cider vinegar but it had no effect whatsoever on my dandruff and no other special properties that I could see. I used just straight apple cider vinegar on my had as I've had very bad dandruff for many years and that worked well although you smell like a big pickle afterwards! So I was really hoping that the claims of this product were true... Unfortunately, it didn't do anything for me. The only shampoo I found that really works is T-Gel. T-Gel doesn't small the greatest but at least it works to get rid of my dandruff and alleviate the itch. I used both of the products for around 4 months. I have a hair fall problem and saw many people recommend this brand's shampoo and conditioner for hair growth but it did not work for me. I did not like the smell of the shampoo but loved the coconut smell of conditioner. I would say it is not worth for the price but maybe it just didn't work for me. I have very thin hair and have tried all kinds of products to thicken it up and not make it greasy. In the past few years my hair was in very bad shape. My sister in law is a hair dresser and cuts my hair. I started using the WOW products a year and a half ago and she said my hair has improved 100%.  Shiny and thicker and growing. My son and my husband both noticed a difference in my hair.  Very happy and satisfied with this product !!! I bought this a few weeks ago, I have been dying n bleach severals times the past few years. The smell is nice help me with my hair loss but it‚Äôs HUGE disappointment on is getting my hair soft and moist. I have not done anything to my hair n I trim my hair every month so I know that the softness & moisture I once had was loss due to this product. Honestly I would not recommend it. My hair feels so dry up n crisp and this time it was not due to dying n bleach. Amazing product love it. Not impressed. I have found several other hair products that work much better Love love love this product makes my hair feel so soft and shiny will never use anythg else again it was used to be awesome before ( 3 years ago ) but I decided to buy it and use it again OMG it is horrible, makes my hair very dry and not comb ableüôÉ .very bad both shampoo and conditioner I love the scent smells really good . The shampoo seems like is a clarifying shampoo that strips the hair of moisture . It has made my hair and my moms hair very dry however when putting a leave in conditioner afterwards it looks beautiful soft and shiny so I‚Äôm a little on the fence about this product I just did a co-wash in my hair with just the conditioner and it dried out. So I‚Äôm not a fan but maybe it works for some people It works fairly well. Not going to be buying again though. I was hoping it made my hair softer than it did though. The shampoo has a slight Apple cider vinegar smell, but it doesn‚Äôt make your hair smell like it if you use the conditioner. I was disappointed with the product because it dried my hair out.  It would be great for oily hair. I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but my hair looks less frizzy. My hair loss is extremely significant. The first time I used this shampoo/conditioner I lost quite a bit of hair, but I thought I'd give it more time. The second time the loss was even more. The third, and believe me the LAST time, my hair loss was significant. Also, my hair looks worse than it ever did, frizzy, dry and scraggly. No, I do not color my hair, so this is not a factor. I will go back to my previous shampoo and this one is in the trash. Conditioner is not moisturizing at all.  Tough to get a comb or brush through your hair after use. I have wanted to try ""WOW"" for a while. I finally bought it and love it. The smell is amazing and last for days. Makes your hair super soft and helps with dandruff. The condition feels amazing as well but because it is oiled based you have to traid off with other conditioners or else your hair is oily It was decent. Not the worst but not the best. I will continue looking for the perfect product for my hair type The shampoo does a decent job but conditioner smells weird. I have to us the other kind. It made my hair dry and itchy. I did not like this product. Bumps starting popping up in my head. I liked it but made my face break out into hives and dry patches Product is great. I didn‚Äôt like being charged 3 times for the one item though. Dried my hair out. Frizzy I was hoping to have fuller hair. It reminds me of Purell. It strips healthy oils from your hair.That conditioner wasn‚Äôt any better. I did leave it on longer as recommended. But I had to rinse that out and put a detangler in my hair just to get a shower comb through it. This is a great product My hair has changed a lot since I've been using this product! Less oily and smells great! Very clean product application and exit. Hair feels smoother. Bought it for my wife. She started to lose hair after two three days. Now she is continuously losing hair everyday. Faded her hair color as well. She had to stop using it to reduce hair lose. Worst shampoo ever we got. Now regretting after buying this. Hair felt dry Dries my hair. Helps a bit with growth but I‚Äôm on my 2nd set and still my hair feels dry. This will be last set of orders. Not a product for fine thin hair.  Didn't feel clean at all.  I sent it back!  Very costly as well! Disappointed. It left my hair super dry. I have nothing about to say about it. I‚Äôm finally writing a review after about a month of using this shampoo, I was very excited when I first got this product because of all the positive reviews! But sadly this did not work for me, it did quite the opposite of what it was supposed to do. My hair felt greasy, had no volume. I also had an itchy scalp and dandruff. At first I thought I wasn‚Äôt washing out the product right but even after trying to wash it more I still had the same outcome! I really did try to give this product a try but it just didn‚Äôt work for me. I had to try this shampoo and conditioner and I really like it. This shampoo and conditioner has a ridiculous number of positive reviews, which led me to try them together. I have almost finished both bottles and still do not understand why there was so much hype for this product. My hair does not seem noticeably shinier or healthier in any way, and my scalp is dryer than it was before starting to use this product (I have flakes where I didn't have them before). Additionally, neither the shampoo nor the conditioner smell particularly good, as so many other reviews implied. My final conclusion on this product is that the reviews were either farmed out or a result of some viral advertisement for this product. I wish I hadn't wasted my time and will be more careful with products on Amazon that have a disproportionate amount of reviews in comparison to other products in similar categories. These products have VERY strong chemical perfume scents!  The shampoo leaves a film on your skin. This shampoo is too harsh for fine hair, and the smell of apple vinegar isn't particularly attractive.  The conditioner is ok; however, at $15, it isn't as good as it should be.  Disappointing. Good shampoo but doesn't do everything it claims it does in the description. Hair still falling out little by little. Awesome, this stuff is Wonderful and a great value with fast shipping ! Very nice product , pleasant scent Love love love the shampoo especially, leaves my hair super soft, conditioner is good too but the shampoo is the best. I would recommend.I can‚Äôt say if it makes my hair grow in thicker from my scalp, might know in a few months if I see evidence of new growth I‚Äôll re review it. I don‚Äôt know why but whenever I would use this stuff it would make my hair more dried out and hard to brush. It does not have a very good smell but that‚Äôs not a surprise since it is apple cider vinegar. My hair has improved from the damage that was there. this Is great for repairing damage and makes my hair super soft.  I have not had to use the conditioner every day like before so I would say that is a success. This product dried out my hair and made extremely thin. This set leaves my hair so greasy. I have never used shampoo and conditioner like this. I will only use the conditioner on my ends and rinse my scalp over and over. The next day, after washing, my hair is so greasy.The shampoo and conditioner leave a thick residue on my hair that causes me to wash my hair again with a different shampoo.I‚Äôve given it a good month but it‚Äôs just horrible for my hair. :( I hope others have better luck. This shampoo made my hair feel stiff and the conditioner did not make my hair soft I had to use another conditioner I had to soften my hair. What a waste of money My only complaint is the screw cap. Wish it was a pump or a pop open cap. Almost lost the bottle in the shower trying to screw on cap at same time not have shampoo drip down hand I was expecting more moisturizing , honestly  its fell like any regular shampoo.the package  looks very nice and fancy This product isn't ""Wowing"" me. The shampoo doesn't lather, I can tell it works but id prefer it to be more obvious. I'm always confused is I need more or if I put enough. The conditioner I like more more. It's hydrating and not too thick. I like the smells, they arent strong at all. Its nice but not super special and I will be buying something else next time around. ( my hair is somewhere between 2c and 3a curly, it wasn't super pleased with these products ) My favorite shampoo. My hair always looks so clean. I can only afford when it‚Äôs on sale so I always buy it if I see the deal.  Highly recommend if you can afford it I enjoy this product.  It makes my hair so soft and manageable. Will buy again. I really like the shampoo, my hair feels fuller and clean when using it.  I feel the conditioner isn‚Äôt as conditioning as I‚Äôd like it to be.  My hair feels dry and tangled when using it.  The conditioner is also very difficult to squeeze out of bottle, need to take cap off and then shake some into my hands. product to use on my hair.  I am an older woman and need moisture for my scalp.  Will buy again!!! It used this for a few months and it made no difference. I've been losing hair for about a year but this set made no difference. Combing my hair out was difficult. It would be so tangly. My hair was no softer or less frizzy than before I used it. Smells good. Very drying to gray hair. I wanted to love this product.  The smell is amazing but it leaves a horrible residue on your hair and scalp. It is so bad that when you run your hands through your hair, your hands will have the same residue.  I have used this product for a little over a month, hoping that my hair would start transitioning to the product. No such luck. The shampoo works good but the conditioner leaves my hair feeling thick and greesy Leaves hair smooth and enhance growth. I really enjoy this shampoo and conditioner. I just have one complaint. I don‚Äôt have oily hair at all, but for some reason this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so oily! Even after I have just washed my hair it feels a little oily and then the next day it‚Äôs so oily I have to use dry shampoo. It‚Äôs nothing a little dry shampoo can‚Äôt fix, but if you already have oily hair please be aware of this. I truly like this product I have a really bad dandruff problem so the apple cider vinegar shampoo and conditioner helps eliminate my dandruff and makes my hair smell wonderfully and soft. Excelent price for the two products. Good quality and smell awesome. Wasn't impressed at all, very disappointed. I was hoping it would help my frizz and it did nothing. Smells great. The shampoo leaves my hair feeling very dry and tangly. The conditioner is moisturizing if you use a handful. As mentioned in my headline, the product is fine.  I like how it cleans my hair leaving it soft  and moisturized.  I am not a fan of the packaging, however.  The enclosed gold tops are awkward to open and I will replace with pumps since they can be operated with one hand.  The labeling is fine in that I can easily see which bottle contains shampoo and which contains the conditioner.  Speaking of the conditioner, it is so thick that it takes great effort to get it to come out with the cap provided. But as I said, I plan to convert to pumps for both so dispensing should be easier. My hair has never been so shiny, soft, HEALTHY till i started using this shampoo and conditioner! I don‚Äôt like the scent of the shampoo though If possible want to give negative 5 stars. Hair became more fizzy and hair fall just multiplied so many times.Caused rashes and itchy scalp. Either the vendor selling adulterated products or product itself worse quality. Save your money, time hair and health. My hair is extremely long and thick.  While I like this shampoo/conditioner, it didn't do anything more than what you can buy at a department store for half the price.  I was hoping for better. My hair didn‚Äôt feel as soft and shiny as I thought it would. Will keep using it to see if it looks better. In the past I have rinsed my hair with diluted apple cider vinegar and it does feel and look soft and shiny. This product helped my scalp itch (product build up). There is no pleasant scent(s). My hair feels softer. I have odered this repeatedly. Seemed to dry out my hair more than make it soft (this is week three of using and I followed the directions of letting it soak, etc‚Ä¶ )  the smell reminds me of dog shampoo‚Ä¶. and even worse were the two days after, of not washing my hair, it starts to smell funky (like the vinegar that‚Äôs in it). I kept thinking it was my gym clothes‚Ä¶ nope, my hair. Would not purchase again. This product is fantastic - gives great body and softness to my hair Used the entire bottle before I wrote the review but even after five weeks of using this shampooer and conditioner my hair is worse now than it ever has been. I am certainly ‚ÄúWOWed‚Äù by these products!!! Several reviews say to give it time ‚Ä¶ no time needed here. First try, and I‚Äôm hooked!! I‚Äôm about 10 months postpartum, and nothing hurts your hair worse than having a baby. lol These products give me shine, softness, and my hair smells GREAT!!! Like even the next day, my hair still smells GREAT!!! Definitely recommend these! Love love this product your will be so shiny Horrible doesn't work I really wanted to like this but I just didn‚Äôt. The scent of the conditioner is like an almond-coconut scent but is VERY strong, which is one of the reasons why I dislike this product. My hair wasn‚Äôt any ‚Äúsofter‚Äù after using the shampoo or conditioner. I personally won‚Äôt buy again. Made my hair greasy and the buildup was horrible! Would not recommend. heavy and oily - disappointed exactly what my hair needed My hairdresser said I got poor results (dry, frizzy hair) because my hair is too dry to use vinegar on it.  Don't know about that, but do know that I had dry, frizzy hair after using these products.  I use a lot of WOW products that I really like, but this one did not work for me. Do not buy. I tried using for about 2 months but it's causing major hair loss Love this shampoo and conditioner,  great for all hair types I have used almost the entire bottle of this shampoo and conditioner and needless to say its not for my hair type. I purchased this brand to help with dry scalp and to volumize thin hair. After drying my hair is clean, however its not silky smooth. It takes a lot of product to cover my scalp and sometimes i have to double shampoo. As for the conditioner it smells great but its not as hydrating and repairing as described. I've noticed that it dries my scalp more and does nothing in terms of volume for my thin hair. I get greasy hair the next day and I am only washing my hair every two days. Would only recommend for a weekly refresh in between washes. I am not sure why this product didn‚Äôt work for me because I love the WOW Dream Coat Spray.PRODUCTI feel like you have to use a lot of the product to get it to lather. My hair is not soft after I use the product and I can‚Äôt get my brush through my hair without using another conditioning product. It smells good. That my only positive.DESIGNThe bottle is pretty to look at but it‚Äôs awkward. When my hands are wet I find it hard to open the tiny cap and the bottle is heavy round and slippery. You have to squeeze a lot of the product out to use.MY HAIRI can‚Äôt get a brush through it after I use the product. I have naturally curly hair but I‚Äôve never had this problem. My hair is full and bouncy but I feel like it looks greasier than normal after the first day. It‚Äôs dry yet plastered to my head.I think there are better products on the market. I wanted to really like it because of the spray. But, I won‚Äôt be buying it again after I finish with these bottles. I love it.it work well.well worth  the money and smells great.!! I lost hair. It didn‚Äôt work. This product works good on my curly dry hair as well as my wife‚Äôs whose hair is thin and on the oily side! It smells great and all but for some reason when I use it, my hair falls out A LOT. Will not be purchasing again. Unfortunately it took me more than a month to realize it wasn‚Äôt for me, so I can‚Äôt return ): It makes my hair frizz and tangle which I have long hair So I've  ordered this before and absolutely  loved It, added moisture  and cleared up my dandruff. Unfortunately this time around It appears I got a bad batch or something. It smelled differently, then after using It, I was left with a weird sticky greasy texture In my hair. I tried to rinse It out but to no avail, I actually  had to rewash my hair with a different  shampoo.  So I'll  have to toss this  out as its unusable. Product good make my hair soft and silky"
93,Wilson Soft Play Volleyball,Sports and Outdoors,"It is hard as a rock. However, it does play well, you just have to have long sleeves. This ball is not soft at all, not recommended for kids. The ball will leave behind stings and slight bruises for beginners. I will update on the durability of the ball as I use it more. This ball is not soft as they mentioned. It hurts sometimes even for young/adult if it comes force.Not a soft one at all for a beginner. Not worth 1 penny! Cracks all over it after 1 day of playing! WAY TOO HARD good ball Just ok Soft however does hurt hands a little bit when you play My daughter wanted to learn how to play volleyball, so I purchased this as an ""entry level"" ball for her. It's OK, and decent value for the price, but certainly cannot be considered as a high quality volleyball. It's great for kids, or for very casual play, but would not last long for more serious players, and is not that soft, so being on the receiving end of any aggressive smashes will hurt a lot more if you use this ball. My daughter complains it‚Äôs to hard. Decent volleyball for the money.  Held up well playing in sand over Memorial Day weekend.  Doesn't wobble like some cheaper products, and allows for a good knuckleball effect if hit correctly, as an advanced player would expect.  Only took a star off because ""soft"" is in the product description.  This ball still stings a bit for those who only play occasionally.  This is not a plush indoor use only ball.. so don't get too unrealistic with your expectations. After using it for a few hours, the stiches are starting to rip open. Not a very durable product. Decent quality for the price. Wilson is still a decent product. Very happy with this volleyball we received. Exactly what we were looking for and has a great feel to it. Kids have loved playing with it. Nice for the price. Not very soft,  Hurts my wrists when I try to bump the ball. Too firm for a child. Fine for teenagers or adults. Great company! Volleyball is a difficult sport to get kids interested in. The ball tends to be harder than most expect and that tends to wear out kids' forearms. However, even adults can get discouraged by a regulation ball. The padding on this ball is ""soft"", even if the impact on your forearms is by no means plush. It still helps reducing the anxiety for beginners and casual players.I love the yellow color. It's a pleasant shade without being too bright or washed out. Love it. I purchased for my 9 year old daughter to play her first season of volleyball and expected a cushier volleyball for a beginner - It is harder than the official ball that they use in the games!  She doesn't like it and doesn't want to practice with it so now I'm purchasing a different brand of volleyball. This ball is not soft at all. It would be painful to play with. The ball is actually quite hard and leaves bruises despite the fact that it says ‚Äòsoft play‚Äô. Not an ideal ball for beginners since it is so hard. I‚Äôve only played with it a few times and already have noticed some rips in the plastic. It did not hold up to outdoor use When I put air in it. It immediately made a tiny hole that ruined the whole ball. Good for product for the price. Great for private practice Got it for my oldest for a birthday gift because she wants to play volley ball. So far we've had no issues. I am only keeping it, hoping my daughters will be used to hard volleyballs. This isn't a soft one Very cheap material The ball deflated overnight after filling it up to the recommended pressure. Not sure why this is the case because I've purchased these balls in the past from Walmart and they weren't like this. Definitely not soft! It feels soft when you feel it, but when you hit it, it hurts! I‚Äôm not able to use it (I‚Äôm 50) but my son has played with it some (he is 15). Doesn‚Äôt seem to bother him as much. Not soft at all. Will not purchase again. It won't hold air. It deflats. a little hard (not as soft as regulation).  leather was harder than a normal ball.  otherwise it was as expected. Great for the beach,the pool,or land! Very soft and does not hurt hand while hitting it Way to hard Short life if you are using it outside on cement. Sand no problems It is pretty hard and hurts my arms and my daughters arms....  so much she doesn‚Äôt want to use it.  It is durable though. this is perfect volleyball for beginners Worthwhile buying Already inflated on receipt. I am not a volleyball player, but this ball is excellent quality and weight. I will leave it to volleyball aficionados to criticize, but for me and the folks who played ""volleyball"" at a fun event, this was a great product that was responsive and held up to beginner play very well. I consider this a five star purchase for my fun times purposes. Good price, as advertised, quick delivery. Two thumbs up. We have had this ball for less than a month and it has not held up.  From day one it wouldn't hold air very well.  We are constantly pumping it up and now it has cracks and fraying on the ball.  Disappointed in the quality.  It wasn't expensive but I did expect more from the brand. It started showing fray after only 2 games and really the feel of the ball is hard on the hands no matter the inflation level.  We would try to buy a different one next time. It's a volleyball! TERRIBLE It's what expected. I played with it and it‚Äôs light and i‚Äôm a beginner So the ball makes my hand red but it‚Äôs softer than most of the other ball and it‚Äôs really fun to play with Not as soft as expected.  Volleyball league provides a molten Vbu-12 that is so much softer than this one.  I thinks it is rated indoor but it doesn't sting the kids arms like the wilson The teal blue one feels like a normal volleyball not the soft practice kind. I bought this for my dogs. I understand this isn't the ideal application of a volleyball, but the surface is quite tough and considerably softer when compared to Jolly Balls. While the dogs were able to rip the blue covering off the ball quite quickly by just nipping at the ball's surface, the integrity of the ball has not been impacted. I prefer volleyballs over soccer balls for dogs to chase with their nose, and I am impressed with this volleyball for that purpose. Really hard(firm) which makes the game kind painful. This is not soft and not for beginners!!! My daughter couldn‚Äôt even stand to practice with this ball and has bruises on her arms in the short time we practiced with it. It's a bit painful for a beginner, I tried a softer ball the same day and it makes a difference. the ball is not soft whatsoever. played it for the first time, my arms were bright pink from how hard it is. Good Love to have this ball to play with my friends. Enjoying practicing / playing every day with. This is a solid and good constructed volleyball. Only issue is that it is not as soft as I was expecting, felt like a normal volleyball to me. Best valleyball ! This is a good volleyball but is not really that soft and it came with air already in it Good, inexpensive volleyball for the casual players. My 12 year old loves the color of the volleyball she did complain that it was a hard ball.  Hopefully will improve after it is broken in. Light weighedNot my favourite It's soft. So far so good Now I get it, its  soft product so how can it be durable. Well I really expected to last longer than it did. My daughter recently got into volleyball and we wanted to get her her own ball. Some of other peoples balls were really hard and hurt her when she practiced, so that why we went for this one. But honestly, its not lasting very long, peeling and such. This is very hard and firm. Painful to use, which was unexpected. Cheap, so its fine for the price. But the firmness problem already earned it space at the bottom of the garage bin. very nice and good for beginners!! although, little pieces were ripping off.. but no big deal :) I'm very happy with this purchase overall. However, I feel it is too far for the item to be listed as ""super soft"". When I ralleyed back and forth with just one friend, my forearms felt bruised from the hardness of the ball. If I played with at least 2 or 3 others, it was more tolerable to have more recovery between hits. It feels about average hardness, not ""soft"". It's also the synthetic material which maybe contributes to the stiff feel.But it works, it's holding up and the color is cute, so whatever! Still happy overall :) I bit the bullet because it was cheap and had Prime shipping and have regretted it ever since. This ball is hard and doesn't bounce like you want from a volleyball. After a few bumps, it'll leave your arms sore and raw. Maybe good for complete beginners who just want to pass a ball. Purchased by request as a Christmas gift. So far no complaints if any arise I will update my comment! Needed by a certain day. It showed up popped Was hoping for a softer ball, but it's good quality, came quickly and was already pumped up amd ready for use. Kids unfailingly get a volleyball to the face, especially when first learning the game. This ball made that a laughing matter rather than a tearful one. Poped first day I got it Ordered for our grade school daughter as she is beginning volleyball. Ordered because of the ball being described as ‚Äúsoft‚Äù. Not a soft volleyball. Volleyball came with a hole... doesn't hold air Not as soft as I was hoping. ok My Daughter liked this ball.  She did complain it was a little hard, but it seemed softer than most so I don't know.  I think this is a better quality ball as well as softer than I remember playing with. This ball looks pretty good on the picture but you can't use it on a beginner or even an addult. It is very hard and doesn't bounce of your forearms at all. Went to Walmart and found a good one for $12.99. is a great brand, it was a great color special for girls.i recomend this product because the cost is low The name  of this volleyball was deceiving.I wanted to like this one but there wasn‚Äôt anything soft about it. It‚Äôs a hard ball. Not for beginners or kids. Very hard good product Bummer day one it doesn't hold air. Wish quality control was better, hassle to return and I wrote name on it prior to inflating I received the ball slightly lopsided and it wasn't the same ball as in the picture. Although I didn't expect too much for a 15$ ball it's not the softest ball either. Good for beach volleyball. Doesn't hurt and bruise your arms on bumps. Came pumped up. Its not meet my expectation. Really feel very much. because i bought for this one to my son know?. But anyway thank GOD. it is not elasticity Good not as bright color in person. Bought it for my niece, she rarely work out since the quarantine, and we realized that she loves to watch Japanese anime which the characters play volleyball. So I bought it for her to encourage her to at least do some exercises, üòÇ . It‚Äôs soft and easy to play, valuable for the price. So far, so good.  We've had it a couple months, since Christmas.  Only played a few times, but it feels great for my younger son.  Hopefully, it holds up. Just for having fun Love the color, but for a ""soft play"" volleyball, its not really that soft.  my daughters play with volleyball lite and this is probably standard weight, but feels a bit heavy.  will see how it stands up to outdoor play. It accompany me whole time during my time in remote island. Great buy. By the end of the first day, the seams are starting to bust.  My 12 and 10 year old were using it an hour at most.  Seems a lot of people have had better luck than we did.  Maybe we just got a dud! I'm not so sure about it being ""soft""... feels a bit squishy, but still very firm and kinda hurts when it hits your arms/hands.  My daughter loves the color pink. Volleyball was just purchase for a decoration but we just decided nothing was wrong with the product choose a change of mind Can‚Äôt inflate it because it came with a tear. Ball did not keep any air from the time I received it! I have no idea how it can be used for volleyball, it's so hard that can break your hands, from the other side outer material started to have cracks after several days. Using it for soccer instead. I purchased 2 of these volleyballs for use on unit fun days as we pass our time here in Afghanistan. We use a piece of camouflage netting for the net, and the court is a concrete pad. The ball bounces across rough rocks, asphalt, the sharp corners of the metal roof, and remains durable and capable. Many hours of downtime have been passed by my soldiers (away from family) on the volleyball ""court"" and for that I'm forever thankful. Liked the look of the ball but thought it would be more comfortable to play with.  All in all, nice ball for the price. I liked.. Very Soft. The name ""soft play"" is misleading. It is covered with exceptionally hard plastic. A shame!Of course, I tried to deflate it.I have several non-brand balls, they are all way softer at any air pressure.It is the plastic covering that makes this ball unnecessarily hard. There must be a hole in it.  Too much hassle to exchange it.  I'll just live with having to add air to it all the time. This was an average product. There is nothing special about it.It's a good idea to get it if you don't care about what kind of ball it is, you don't care how long it takes to get to you, or if you don't want to drive to get it.My advice is to just drive to the store so you can test it out and make sure that it is the one you want since you will be paying the same. This way you can get it immediately too. Perfect for the 9 yr old granddaughter After inflating for a while, it is flat again. This is too bad. I have to inflate again and again. The ball came very flat Too hard not enough padding Not durable.  We‚Äôve only had it a few weeks and already the surface is cracking & peeling.  Loses air quickly. It's nice ball for practice novice players. very light and sturdy to handle. Quality is good and price as well. Use at beach good quality We ordered 5 as give-a-way gifts.  We were very disappointed that they were not inflated.  It's a good thing one of our employees had an air pump at home or we would have had to purchase one. I bought this for my 7 and 11 years old daughter, both of them complaining the ball is extremely hard for their wrist. Great ball I got this ball expecting it to be somewhat softer than the other volleyball we just bought.  I was disappointed to learn that it was even harder than the other one.  That said the price was right and I will use it but don't expect it to be soft! Item is great, but the exact same volleyball is sold at walmart for $5. Not sure why it's $9 here. A perfect volleyball for my two young daughters. Inexpensive volley ball for outdoor use.  Actually fairly well made and playable. This ball is really hard and painful and I‚Äôm semi experienced in volleyball. Haven‚Äôt played for awhile so wanted to go easy on my wrist and it‚Äôs not what I expected. Reasonable price. Durability is awful. It will last 3-4 days max. two. Seriously. It cracked and started to peel  on day 2. Awful quality. Can‚Äôt believe its Wilson. Fell apart 4 weeks after we bought it Exactly as pictured and blown up too. My son loved it It's truly not as soft as it may be anticipated for, but I've been playing for 8 years and cant tell...  me friends on the other hand always complain Not soft at all‚Ä¶terrible ball for a young kid It's really soft and I like it's color. Not durable, but not expensive Daughter uses to practice! Great volleyball I got this ball for my 5 year old daughter who loves playing with her older sister. It is not soft at all. It stings to bump this ball. Very low quality. They will prob end up kicking this ball instead of playing volleyball with it. Would not recommend it, especially for younger kids wanting to learn to play volleyball We got this specifically to use in our pool. It arrived somewhat underinflated. No big deal. That's common. Fully aired it up. By the time I carried it over to the pool it was underinflated again. Turns out it's leaking at the seams. So, it loses a little air every time there's the slightest bit of pressure applied...you know like the pressure of hitting the ball back and forth over a volleyball net, or even just the pressure of carrying it under your arm.Unfortunately, we didn't use it right away, and now we're past the 30 day return window. However, I contacted Amazon, and they quickly created a return shipping label to return it and receive a refund, even though I was a few days beyond the return window. So, 5 stars for Amazon's customer service, but as for the product, it's definitely not worthy of more than 1 star. I purchased these for my under 11 volley ball team. The girls hate them!  They are hard as rocks! Actually boulders! I was confused about the statement of soft play! Really great volleyball for the water!! Only problem is (and it‚Äôs not Amazons or Wilson‚Äôs fault) is that the kids were playing with it on the beach and it got deflated by a palm tree"
94,adidas Men's Adilette Shower Slide,Computers,"Not adjustable or comfortable. Ran too small. All of our slides were a size or 2 too small. Not good They don't describe the insole for the foot. It's hard to describe but it's an uncomfortable slide. I'll stick to Nike! The strap on these Adidas Men's Adilette Shower Slide are too small.I purchased a size 13 pair, while the shoe itself could fit my foot the strap where I slide in my foot in only allowed about 3/4 of my foot to fit making these shoes useless. While I have a large foot I do not have a swollen or particularly wide or fat foot. I would avoid this product. Not bad. Does make feet smell if you wear it for a long period of time, recommend wearing socks if you're gonna wear it and aboid prolonged skin to rubber contact. He‚Äôs as hell. Didn‚Äôt like these at all. No comfort. I've been wearing size 13s since I was in high school. These are just too small for my feet, however. Probably ok for people with small feet ... but not those with big feet. Get a size bigger too small Great support,comfort and very durable. I had to buy another pair when my last pair were hijacked by my husband and kid. I love these. So much support, so comfy. Forever my favorites. It was good The joints were the top meets the sole is falling apart my son wear a 9 1/2 so got 10 but lil tight he will have to brake them in Just like I had 30 years ago- same great product!!!! These are smaller than they should be. Shockingly poor quality!!One plastic top came off, held on only by the mesh lining. This after one weeks wear, happening while out shopping. Made for a extremely inconvenient, uncomfortable rush back home to change shoes.This is a first in my 57 years of shoe wearing.Will return and never purchase this over priced, plastic, name brand shoe again!! bot good These are my favorite slipons but one wrong roll of the ankle and they break. Expect something a little more durable from a namebrand. Great support though They had one job - to be comfortable - and they failed. I can't recommend them. Ordered them as shower/dorm shoes for my son. He says they are ""just right"". These were small i even order a size bigger then my regular shoe and still couldn't wear them. To tight Very comfy and lots of cushion comfortable, ware it go everywhere.. Needs to be alittle harder material. This is a fine product but be warned - it has a weird arch support in it that was not really comfortable when walking for long periods of time. Excellent Sandals, very comfortable, fits the Size as expected and can be worn at home or for a walk outside. I was worried that this would come out poorly due to the large amt of negative reviews, but it fit true to size. My boyfriend loves them :) Bought them as a gift.  He loved them. Did not fit I bought them for my husband,  he‚Äôs a size 10 and laughed at me because only his fingers would go inside these slides. They fit me that I‚Äôm a size 7. Also very cheap material. It‚Äôs not Adidas. Very disappointed! Great comfortable sandle. A little snug if you have wide feet Wanted a 12 got a 10 There is no padding on the underside of the strap that goes over your foot. The result for me was that the seam at the front of the strap rubbed against the top side of my toes. Very uncomfortable and it was immediately clear that these wouldn't work for me. This was returned and I found a better pair elsewhere. These broke within hours of my son putting them on. He wore them on a 3 hour flight and got to the resort and one of them broke! So now we are on vacation and I have to go purchase him new sandals...again! This is the second time I'm buying these slides, they are just perfect. Definitely will suggest it My brother  loves them ! Worn out very easily One minus it's not comfortable if wearing too long. Save your money, buy something else! Definitely not for a wide foot. Length looked OK. üëå Did not fit at all. Way to small. Rather then pay for return I just have to my kid to wear. Husband loves them had to get a second pair bc our dog chewed his up. The numbering didn't match and the slipper didn't fit, I use that numbering on everything and this product didn't work, terrible quality. These were actually purchased as a birthday gift for my 15yr old nephew and he absolutely loves them.!! Excellent product and comfortable Ordered these for my husband these fit like a size 9  order up on these Not very comfy at first. You'll have to wear them constantly to soften them up. Boyfriend has thicc boi feet and the band wasn't large enough to fit his foot- good for somebody with feet on the smaller side, but if you're bigger, you'll need an adjustable pair for sure. Quality is great though. Very comfy, delivered fast. Runs super small had to return The slides run small so you have to get a size up I wear a size 9 US in most any shoe and these run very small. If I were to re-order, I would order a size 10 US I ordered a 13 and it is at least, one full size TOO small.  And It‚Äôs a hassle to return so I will end up giving them away as a gift. On the plus side, it looks GREAT but so did Cinderella‚Äôs slipper to her step sisters. These slides seem to run very small. I ordered a size 12 and they don't fit the person they were intended for. I was able to give them to someone who wears a size 10 men's. Poorly made.I expect more from adidas.If these are even real adidas.Not true to size. I'm usually a size 8.5 women's and a 7 in men's (sometimes a 7 men's in Adidas is a smidge big due to the width). So I bought the 7's thinking they'd be perfect. I couldn't even get my foot in them. Like at all. They were ridiculously small. I don't know if they all run small or if I just got a pair that were incorrectly sized. That said, the return policy was stellar and I had no issues getting a refund. The overall quality is good, but size 10 is smaller than expected. Too narrow. It‚Äôs almost as if the width is in women‚Äôs size. The material is rubber, but it's really hard. Might be uncomfortable for some. These seem to be made out of cheap material compared to Adidas sandals from the late 90s. I remember Adidas used to have great high quality sandals. My boyfriend wore these once and they gave him blisters. He said they're very uncomfortable. Not comfortable.  Hurts my arch in my foot. Comfortable but they fall off easley, and are bouncy when walking The quality of Adidas shower slippers has went downhill. These are not the same as they were back in the 90s or 00s. My first pair I ordered off Amazon only lasted for a year. I wore them strictly inside as indoor & shower slippers. Nothing too heavy. One of them ripped so I ordered a replacement.I've had the second pair for only 5 months. It was beginning to give off a mildewy odor that I could smell up to 3 feet away. I'm a clean freak when it comes to personal hygeine and I always rinse out my slippers after each shower. I check to see that the underside of the strap is actually NOT waterproof. It is a foamy cushion like synthetic fabric that will soak up water. I can understand them putting that there for comfort purposes, but to advertise it as a shower shoe is misleading. I tried washing these with soap and water and let them air dry. Nope, still has the awful smell. I'm hesitant to put these in the washer since the last pair ripped from normal use. I never had a problem with the last pair, so why are these different?If you want these as fashion slippers, go ahead and get them. They fit fine, are comfortable, and good for casual use. Don't expect them to last long, and don't get them wet. These are NOT waterproof.**Update: I soaked them in a bleach solution for several hours. Guess what, the odor was still faintly there! The underside material will hold onto nasty foot odors like no other! There were exactly what I expected. My son feels that very comfortable and styling Love these for taking out the trash or getting the mail. The difference between standing at your mailbox in tighty whiteys or a robe. Cheap looking and the sizes are off. If you are going to buy these, buy them a size larger. Very comfortable but the top part of the shoe rubs a bit; feel great with socks though. I‚Äôd recommend buying. Felt cheap and really bad quality. Not the same as the ones sold in Dicks or the regular sport shops. Nice I purchased these with high hopes. The side strap that goes across your foot has already come apart. Sad because these sandals are actually comfortable. Cool looking summer sandals perfect for the beach The sole is somewhat flat, but they move well with you Feel like cheap plastic, but they are comfortable though, the base supports well and the curve shape on top holds my feet well. Very comfortable My 2nd pair. It was too tight when I first wear it. After I wear it for couple weeks, it did become loose, So that‚Äôs good. I love it because it‚Äôs simple style and clean look, but I feel like it‚Äôs a bit over-priced. Very tight fitting. The length is good though. They also seem very nicely made but just a bit tight for me. Hopefully they stretch out a little bit as I wear them Like Comfortable- 0/10 they feel like a hard plastic and the band across the top of the foot cuts into your foot‚Ä¶ I normally wear a size 11, so that‚Äôs what I ordered.  Probably should have ordered a size 12.  They fit a little small.  Don‚Äôt want to go thru the hassle of returning them so I‚Äôm keeping them hoping they‚Äôll stretch out. Run a little small I usually wear a 7 in men's but I feel like a 7.5/ 8 would have been a little more comfortable I think the strap over the foot is just a little too tight. Otherwise super great! I like how wide they are feels good on the toes Doesnt seem to have any durability at all not of much quality Its about two times larger than the size selected.... that's soo stupid Not made with the same quality as some of my other Adidas slides. I was disappointed. I‚Äôm woman‚Äôs size 9, men‚Äôs 7. I got an 8 and they too small do not fit at all. I am a size 11 and they do not fit true to size at all. The strap is far too small not allowing me to slide my foot all the way in. that was my second time order the same item i love it Bought these and they fita as expected. Have good support and are very comfortable. Made well should last a while. I gave them away Not cushy at all. There shower shoes not slides for walking. The product arrived without any physical damage or cosmetic imperfections,The design is good and material seems durable enough for normal wear and showers. The sturdy shoe hanger is a nice bonus.At first, I was on the verge of returning them, because of their high midsole. Every twenty to thirty minutes of standing/walking caused severe pain in the midfoot area. As my feet are slightly flat, I thought that I'm probably not used to this kind of slippers. After three days of using them, the pain dispersed.It's already a month that I'm using them and i think that their high midsole kinda fixed my slight flat feet. Fit snug, same quality for 20+ years. These slides don‚Äôt disappoint. Super comfort, great arch support, can get mail in them without getting feet wet! Theses slides are okay. Not the most comfortable however looks good. I would not suggest for persons with wide feet. My feet are narrow and it fits quite snug. The shoe also runs small so I would suggest going a 1/2 size or full size up. I'm usually a men's size 7 but I wish I had gotten an 8 instead. The sides are stuck not sewn so it probably not very durable. Love Bro was so happy when I got them.didnt know they was coming I ordered a mens sz 6 which is womens 8. I usually wear 7.5 in women. They got just right I recommend order 1 whole sz up. Perfect for everyday casual wear‚Ä¶comfortable and exact fit! Yep the boy liked em The look and the length of the sandal are great. The strap is way too tight. The sandals are too narrow. I had to return them. My husband‚Äôs favorite around the house shoe. Loved these slides just too small normally wear 13 but sent back and ordered different ones cause they didnt have a 14 Not the most comfortable bottom, a little hard in my opinion but good support and fit perfectly to my size To small I'll have to super glue the top half to the bottom sole and hope for the best but it is really unfortunate. It does seem to wear out the sole pretty fast. Sadly, the size ran small on these and I had to return them. Great shoe.  Runs a little small. Awkward foot print. Raised portion on the inside of sandals doesn‚Äôt contour well with my foot. Makes them I comfortable at the ball of my feet Good but runs small This product fits small and narrow,even on normal sized feet like mine. Cost cutting is obvious. The slide was too small , I even ordered a size bigger , not recommend, poor material too These slippers Broke right after the Return Window and they were used only three times. The strap is cheaply glued on the base.  They fell apart on the way to the beach from the car, 50 yard walk.  My son didn‚Äôt even make it to the sand‚Ä¶. Very poor quality.  We do not recommend. Like plastic says cloudfoam but these are definitely not like the adilletes I bought last from adidas directly. I don't recommend them unless price is your only concern I really wanted to get these for my husband, but I‚Äôm having to return them because they don‚Äôt fit. I got him a size larger than he normally wears and they were still too small. Idk. Not really worth the hassle."
95,"havit HV-F2056 15.6""-17"" Laptop Cooler Cooling Pad - Slim Portable USB Powered (3 Fans), Black/Blue",Computers,"When I received the product, one of the fans did not rotate properly.  Other than that, it was fine.  The fans are quiet, and it seems to do a decent job at cooling.  I like how there is an extra USB port in the back.  Also the lights are a nice touch.  I would wait for the replacement to change my review, but I think it's important to consistently send quality products.  Unfortunately, mine was of a lower quality. it doest have any holders to keep it Laptop very  uncomfortable to use . This product has a nice design, but it is noisy due to the fan motors' obsolete technology. Those fans use single-phase brushless DC motors, and they have rough commutation processes. So the fans make ticking noises as they turn due to the commutations the motors make. This product should use three-phase brushless motors for the fans, which run smoother and generate a lot less noise during commutation processes. This laptop cooling pad is absolutely perfect. This cooling pad replaced a bulk and noisy Belkin cooling pad that was more than a decade old.  I needed something whisper-quiet that my microphone would not pick up, and this is that thing! The lights are fun, and it has two USB for powering devices. It's also the perfect size for my laptop workstation, and takes up less space than my older cooling pad. This item arrived on time and works as advertised. I have been using it for a couple days and am pleased so far. It really is whisper quiet and it certainly keeps my laptop a lot cooler than my makeshift ""prop it up on something like a box of staples to get some air circulation underneath it"" method. My work laptop is running easily 12-14 hours a day lately thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic so I knew I was better off buying a cooling pad for my home office than to try to requisition my corporate IT team for one while they're in the midst of dealing with a few hundred, if not thousands, employees who do not have a work-from-home setup like I do. It's also super light so I'll be packing this in my briefcase for when life goes back to normal and I can return to working in my favorite restaurants again.My only ""design tweaks"" are I wish the fans were in a slightly different arrangement and I can do without the blue lights. The way it currently is, there are two fans in the lower portion of the pad. My laptop vents are closer to the hinge where the screen is attached. I have to sit it so the lower edge of my laptop is aligned with the lower edge of the cooling pad. It's a silly gripe but for anyone who is more particular than I am about how the fans align with their vents, take note. I would either just make this cooling pad with four fans to universally cover any laptop's vent position or I would flip the arrangement and have two fans in the upper portion and one in the lower portion.Overall, this is proving to be a worthwhile investment provided it holds up. Just received it yesterday. I got this for MacBook pro. I use it the other way around so the two fans are hitting the back of the computer, this way the pad is cooling the laptop. It would be great if the design would be that way so I can use the stand. The blue lights are very annoying.Does the job and the price is good so three stars. Doesn't really cool down my laptop that well, only thing I like is that it lifts my laptop up Keeps laptop cool My laptop was constantly locking up due to heat.  This hasn't exactly cured that, but the problem has been significantly reduced since using this fan. Pros:Good build design.The extra USB port on the back allows you to make up for the one you lose on your device if you are plugging the fan into your laptop.Looks slick.Moves air without any real noticeable sound.Cons: (though they are both very minor)Slightly smaller than my 17"" laptop, so there is a bit of overhang on either side.Blows air towards the device rather than pulling the hot air away Great buy and stops my computer overheating on hot days, we do not have AC. It was working well for me at first. Then almost 3 months later 2 of the 3 fans just stopped working completely. I tried contacting the manufacture since when my fans stopped I was still in the 90 day warranty window. I haven't heard back from them, and probably won't. This product is really solid on the major points. Sturdy construction, near silent operation, and keeps a gaming laptop much cooler than without. Couple details knock a star off for me though. I have an MSI GE66 Raider, and although the size is a perfect match, the front rubber foot spans the whole width of the laptop. This means it doesn't fall in the grooves on this cooling pad, and slides forward pretty easily. Another thing is the feet on the cooling pad itself. While I think the design is comfortable on both lap and desk, it leaves really nasty black scuff marks on my white desk. My other devices with rubber feet don't have that problem, this particular material is really prone to it. It is perfect with little noise and minimal power consumption. I use it while playing video games and my laptop is always kept cool. It also gives the room nice blue lighting at night, making it a perfect environment for gaming. The biggest plus is that it is durable and well-built, unlike many others with fans that may crack near the openings due to being made of a cheaper material. I have an Alienware M17 R3 with the 2070 Super chip which means my laptop gets blazing hot. I was hoping this would be as amazing as the reviews say but it barely changes the temperature. The fans are also in an odd place compared to my laptops fans. pro is that it‚Äôs super quiet though. I wish this had some rubberized material or silicone to prevent my Macbook from sliding around since I mostly use my laptop in bed at an angle. Otherwise it works good and keeps my older laptop cool in the extreme Las Vegas heat. Fan cools as described. Convenient ports. Only con is when using with metal laptop case it tends to slide. I resolved this by place small pads underneath. This is something you'd use to keep it cool in general. You try gaming with this thing, and I can assure you it wont be enough. Look for something else if you want a cooling pad for gaming. Works well enough.  Provides outer surface cooling mostly, but that is better than nothing.  Wife needed one as well so she ended up with this one and I bought a different one. Literally useless, it‚Äôs cable is way short. I like the slant it gives the laptop.  But the cooling factor was less than I want. This Worked great for 8 months but after that both USB ports no longer work. Would of liked at least a year out of it. It's quiet and... that's about it. I really wanted it to be a useful as the number of positive reviews seem to suggest, but it... just wasn't. Not grippy at all, so I couldn't use the riser legs or my laptop would slip right off, and it did not make a significant enough dent in temperature to justify the purchase. Even though it has three fans, the amount of noticeable effective airflow in one direction feels quite negligible.  when placed flat on a surface, it barely moved or lifted a sheet of paper.  Only when the unit is angled or propped up by it's build in standoffs does it do a more effective job, just barely. I'd say it's not an effective cooling method for demanding laptops.  Casual laptop use is just okay. Laptop slides around, would be nice to have some grip to prevent that. Found one that has grip to keep laptop in place. Fans didn‚Äôt seem to do much for cooling imo. It doesn't work well.. It is a waste of money.. It does the job, but two fans broke after less I don't know if I got a defective product, but these fans barely do anything. I literally can cool my laptop off much more efficiently by propping up the back and pointing a fan at it. Do not waste your money on this - go with Klim. My laptop would not stay in place on the surface, it kept sliding down.  You have to have the feet extended to lift it up for air circulation but the slant then causes the laptop to keep sliding.  I had to buy some ""sticky"" buttons and put them on the cooling pad to keep the computer in place. My 17"" laptop gets really hot.  This cooling pad cools it back down.  Unlike my last cooling pad, this one is silent, and my laptop doesn't tend to slide off.  I travel a lot, and at 1"" thickness (with the feet retracted) and removable USB power cord, it packs very easily.  It is absolutely worth every penny.  My son has the same laptop, and I'm going to order one for him as a gift.  No regrets! My Mac gets hot during zoom calls and the fans ramp up, sometimes to max.  This is a nice pad, and is fairly quiet, but it has almost zero effect on bringing down the laptop temperature and slowing the fans.  In my case it was essentially a waste of money. Nowhere near powerful enough to cool a gaming laptop. Just adequate enough to cool my work laptop. Too much sub par Chinese made junk on amazon Broke after one year. It's not bad but I don't understand how I can use a Walmart fan for a decade but this for the same price for a year. And it doesn't blow hard enough to reduce heat. It‚Äôs made mostly out of breakable plastic, while the top part is a metal grate.After 4 months my fan moved and now makes a constant noise.Do not use this for MacBooks. It slides right off the incline.Fan speed is kinda low, for gaming.Not very happy for $40....Update: I changed it to a four out of five. I may have been a drama queen before. It‚Äôs pretty good although my main annoyance is that you cannot use some MacBooks as they slide off no matter what. They gave me a free replacement only 6 months usage and it is already not working.  fans are stopping and the switch or cord is janky.  Would really like a replacement or refund. I have a MacBook Pro that gets extremely hot on the bottom.  The pad does a great job keeping the Mac cool.  It is very quiet and I hardly feel any breeze from it.  So much that I was worry that it was not work.  The pad sticks out about  1 1/4"" all around my 15"" Mac.  There is One problem with Mac users.  The power cable is a 20"" USB to USB.  I was lucky that I am using an adaptor docking station with an extra USB port.  It is great with an adaptor because when the  Mac shuts down, so the pad turns off too.  Otherwise, the pad has to sit near an USB outlet.  The pad has two USB ports and an on/off switch in back. No fan speed controller which would be unnecessary for this pad. Product arrived today. Plugged it into every single USB port on my laptop, and it didn't turn on for any of them. Huge dissapointment. Works like it suppose to. No problems yet... My kingdom for a decent cooling pad... for some reason it just doesn't exist and this one is in the junk pile with a half a dozen other. The build quality on this doesn't measure up and here's the brief list of Pro/Con to this 4.5/5 star group-think reviewed pad that I seemingly can't understand.Cons:1. The fans are built straight into the base housing which is made not of metal, not of hard plastic, but bendable plastic. If the base was of a more durable material, or if the fans had any kind of re-enforcement around them this would not lead to...2. In conjunction to #1, if you place the laptop on your lap and/or move it by picking up it will bend the fans inward to the top of the metal housing causing the fans to scrape. It took just a few simple moves from my lap to table for this to be a problem.3. The fans eventually due to the poor design will seize or become incredibly noisy due to becoming off balance.4. You cannot disable the blue LED on the pad which is incredibly bright and serves no purpose for those of us who do not need to draw attention to ourselves. Much like putting racing stickers on a car, it doesn't increase performance and just makes anyone over the age of 30 cringe.Pros:1. The top half of the housing is made of solid aluminum and does not bend and is clearly re-enforced unlike the bottom.2. The airflow is decent and it serves it purpose on your lap or table until it fails due to the cons above.Why on earth nobody can make a solid constructed pad with good airflow which can be maintained is beyond me, but I've now gone through several of the top rated pads on Amazon and they all either have these exact design flaw, do not allow maintenance, or have horrible airflow. I'd happily pay $100 at this point for something that isn't made of Chinesium and just _works_ Does not have a slip resistant surface and my computer slides off which make it annoying. Gave it 3 stars for that fact. Needs a different top surface. So I guess it does what it needs to do with the fans. But my laptop keeps sliding down when I have the stand legs up. The indents on the stand are too small and shallow to actually keep the laptop in place, so it keeps shifting and its annoying to keep readjusting as in typing. Otherwise its fine. ARRIVED QUICKLY AND AS DESCRIBED , PLEASED WITH COOLING. It works as expected, you can place your laptop on any surface without fear of overheating. I use it with a gaming laptop and I have no issues with overclocking since this keeps it cool on any surface I've used it on. This product is quiet and works fairly well when there is a low amount of stress to my machine but it does not work well for high intensive tasks or a laptop with a lot of horsepower.I use a Lenovo Thinkpad P15 (i9)I am a software developer and I tend to run a lot of different processes at the same time and my laptop kept reaching 55-65C - which is not horrible but it‚Äôs not the best - hence the 2 stars. Was so disappointed, first it didn‚Äôt even want to start then after giving a few minutes and plugging it back in the fan is super loud and making some kind of knocking soundit‚Äôs also impossible to get through customer support so I have a 16.75 inch laptop and got this Colling pad. Its very silent and fans work fine but it feels small for a 17 inch laptop. When it said up to 17 inches I expected it to at least  be 16 inches wide but that's on me I should have checked the dimensions. Overall if you're laptop is 16 inches or lower you should be fine but if you have a bigger laptop you might want to think twice before purchasing. I liked it when I first got it. It was quiet and kept my laptop cool. However, after a few months, the blower became quite noisey. It still works, it's just loud and annoying. This does nothing but blows a bit of air. It will not lift a little piece of paper nor will you even feel it. I have to use an additional fan to blow into this damn thing in order to get air into my gaming laptop. Try a new product because this isn‚Äôt worth anybody‚Äôs money.This thing can be used as decoration. The fan levels are inaudible, because they aren‚Äôt doing much anyways. It‚Äôs a good laptop stand but then you would buy a laptop stand and not this so called ‚Äúlaptop cooler‚Äù. Don‚Äôt buy this if you are actually looking for a cooling laptop pad. Ergonomics are a hit or miss. There are two little legs you can put up and that‚Äôs it. Non adjustable so it will work for some but not for others Comes with a tiny usb cable of 1feet to power the device. I had to buy an additional 6ft usb cable by spending another 8$ Bought it mainly for use on my lap... but one (or more) of the fans is unbalanced and creates an annoying cyclic vibration.EDIT:  The seller sent me a replacement cooling pad free of charge, which has *less* vibration, but is still not perfect.  Good enough I suppose...  I will say that this product will be perfectly fine if you're only planning on using it on a hard surface like a desk or table. I have an asus fx503vd 15.6 inch and the only good came out of this is the quietness of it. The height adjustable did not working on my laptop it was slowly sliding down and cooling wasn't really great when you're playing games. So folks its not a ideal if you're thinking this will cool down your laptop while playing because it dont. Their support sucks haven't got a reply from them. So, if you're reading this, your product didn't meet my expectation and will not recommend this. not really work to my laptop Easy purchase, would do it again and again. Quiet and noticeable difference in computer temps. 100% great product Product is much noisier than expected, and feels generally low quality. Within months the power cable would only work if positioned at the right angle, and after a little longer it stopped working all together. I have tried a couple replacement cables but for some reason they do not work either, so I suppose it could be the whole unit that eventually broke. Either way it is not worth your time. Does not vent air unless legs are out. Here's the next problem when the legs are out my laptop keeps sliding off. It is fairly quiet and does vent good when legs are propped up. Its alright, my laptop still overheats but im not completely disappointed After 6 months, the noise started and it‚Äôs loud. I purchased this product almost 13 months ago.  For most of this time it performed great, it was quite and kept the laptop cool.Then, I started having the issues others report after a similar time period.  The fans seems to get off balance, they either spin very slowly (while making lots of noise) or do not spin at all.  So, now it doesn't work.If you do the math on purchase price vs time product lasted it equals roughly $2.70 per month to keep your laptop cool for a year and then you'll need to purchase something else.It was great while it worked.  But, I'm not happy that it suddenly has issues after a year. Completely useless for the Asus Zephyrus, doesn't help cool off the laptop at all. An overall slim package good for light use not much louder than your laptops regular phone . however plastic it's made out of is somewhat cheap with only three fans it doesn't really keep your device as cool as you would really want during gaming. With only three fans you actually need to make sure they line up with your computer to actually work I had to use it in the opposite direction to get any results. Overall for the price it's good enough but definitely invest more and get something that suits your computer and your level of use Lasted 5 months of easy use - one of the USB ports in the back stopped working and when I tried disconnecting the USB cable the whole plug in the back pulled out .....Not worth the money ...... Product completely stopped working within 6 months. Tried to contact seller, but never received a response. Looks like I'm going to have to do a chargeback. My laptop used to auto-sleep due to overheat after intense gaming for several hours. It hasn't happened since I started using this cooler. It is quiet and even looks good! Great fan, my laptop got hot really quick when I bought it so I bought this fan with good reviews and not too expensive. Great product for the price. My laptop never gets hot at all. Size was great works pretty good, the noise level is very low, but I hope the next version can have an option to turn blue lights off. This product came with the stabilizing pads removed. It scratched my coffee table and my desk. By the time I went to return it the window had closed. Will not buy again. Good product. Does what it states it will do. Cools and awesome lighting. Noise not abnormal (sounds like a fan on high) Great for many hours of gaming. Yo everyone listen up! If you are on your pc for a cool minute, this WILL NOT LAST, I bought this on the 8th, I fell in love with it, I make music and I love to play games on my laptop. It really worked it really did but the fans started to get slower or there was just not enough power. I have an omen 15 and the thing is a beast so it couldn‚Äôt have been my pc but anyways, It started getting very slow and I‚Äôve only had it 7 days. Around 4 days in is when I noticed it slowing down. HOPE THIS HELPS SOME OF YOU! The first time I ordered, only 2 of 3 fans spinned.  I returned that one for a replacement, which worked great over the past two months until a fan stopped working on that one.  I am giving 2 stars for the two months that it worked as advertised.  You might want to consider another option before spending thirty-five bucks on this. quiet Not a whole lot to say. Build quality and airflow are sufficient but nothing to write home about. Laptop fan often still kicks on. LEDs add a touch of flair. Has retractable feet to create a slight downward angle if you'd like, so I guess mild ergonomics. USB cable feels fairly cheap. It works if you don't plan to move it around much and don't expect to do anything wildly intense with your laptop, and certainly beats nothing. You get what you pay for! doesn't do anything for cooling off laptop Very noise Product does not work with Macbook Pro 2020 and customer service is a joke trying to figure out the problem. Try looking for a better quality product as this one seems to be a scam. The fan on the right is not working.  I can't find the seller to complain. I did not want to give negative review so I would go no further. If he at least a part of my money or send another then I would be satisfied. This thing is so quiet you have to check to see if it's on.  I've not seen it drain the computer battery either by having it plugged in.  I absolutely love this and it keeps my laptop cool.  Not oddly cold but cool like it should be.  Love the blue lights very calming.  Worth every penny! I rarely ever write reviews, but if you have a MacBook Pro and you are a power user, this product is not for you. The only thing this product is good for is elevating the laptop and slightly increasing airflow. You can barely feel the air blowing off the fans.I gave it two stars because the build quality seems fairly decent. It is comfy for typing, and as a stand, but I have ran many stress tests to see the affect of this pad, and it did not cool down my computer at all. On a heavy cpu load it was averaging at about 86c, and remained the same with or without the pad. It is very quiet, because the fans are very weak. Almost do nothing, even to a napkin. This cooling pad is absolutely perfect! I put a load on my gaming laptop to bring the temps up and used HWMonitor to watch the temps. Plugged in the laptop cooler, switched it on, and the temps immediately went down and stayed down. I've been running the cooling pad pretty much constantly over the past month with no problem.It's extremely quiet and extremely lightweight. It's simple... it switches on and it switches off. It can lay flat or can be slightly elevated by flipping the back feet down.Simple, efficient, lightweight, and looks great. Highly, highly recommend this cooling pad!! It‚Äôs pretty quite and it does blow air just not to the point where it‚Äôll comfortably keep my laptop cool. The lightning is nice it‚Äôs not too bright but not low enough where you can‚Äôt see it. The noise is surprisingly very quite but I‚Äôm very skeptic when it comes to its ability to cool my laptop. Additionally, there are only pads on the bottom of the cooling system that is slip proof. There is nothing to keep my laptop up on it from slipping down as the cooling pad is elevated. Overall it‚Äôs okay and it‚Äôll do for now I‚Äôm just not very impressed. This laptop fan has a very low rpm which makes it no good for gaming seassions where you want it to have a noticable impact on thermals for your device . keeps you cool not the laptop . I bought this on July 2020, it worked well for a few months, but now that my spring classes are about to start, the fans stopped working. I only used it for my online zoom classes which was twice a week. I don't even play video games nor stream long videos. Only lasted 6 months. I cannot return it. Totally dissapointed. Excellent fan - quiet - immediately cooled down my laptop that runs all day Overall cools my laptop and is quiet. The only issue is that it is too slick and my MacBook slides off little by little.I need to rig stops to keep it from happening. The shipping on this product was fast and the fan itself is quite, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to cool my laptop down. Far less effective than I expected. I dont expect a 30-degree reduction in temperature but I expected at least 5-10 degree reduction. Unfortunately no noticeable impact, especially when gaming. Good to use if you want some height for your laptop though. Horrible... Just horrible, I‚Äôve had it for about 6 months and used it for about 3 and the cooling pad gives a very hard time staying lit up and moving. It feels very cheap especially the cord that connects to the pc, it came with a shortage in it that I‚Äôve been working with for the time I‚Äôve had it. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even work at all and it constantly disconnects my mouse! Not so happy! Helps keep my laptop cool, but it would be great if it either had a lip or maybe made of a less slippery material so my laptop wouldn't slide when using it. Really impressed with how light and quiet this unit is.  Metal surface and it includes an extra USB connection in addition to the first used to power it.Surprised at how well it works to keep my overworked Dell running more cool. My MacBook Air would get really hot during zoom calls. This is much quieter than the fan in the laptop and does keep it cooler. I'd like it to be a little smaller, but I think it's a one size fits all thing. But it absolutely does what I wanted it to. This broke after 1 month of use; purchased protection plan and now cannot activate it to get replacement. Last me only one month and it dosent cool your laptopüòï Works really well, and so its been a fantastic addition to the laptop! Reliable and quiet Great product! Very quiet! I forget and leave it on all the time because it is so quiet. I bought it for the reviews on how quiet it is and it lives up to the hype. I misjudged how big it is and I probably should have gotten the smaller size since I use a 13‚Äù MBP but it‚Äôs not really much of an issue. Highly recommend! Lightweight and sturdy for correct sized laptop. However does not have the fan power i was expecting. Usb powered. Actually was better off just placing a small fan by my laptop to cool it off a bit when gaming. This device is so quiet I do not even realize it is on and often forget to turn it off during the day When the blue light doesn‚Äôt stand out so much. This is awesome chill bad exactly what I was looking for. Initially I loved this. It looked good, ran quietly and kept my laptop cool for the amount of time that it lasted. However, I purchased this 8 months ago, and within maybe the last 2 - 3 months, one by one each of the three fans died out. My dell laptop would often overheat but this fan keeps the laptop running and is extending its life Destroyed my laptop, plugged it in, next thing I know, laptop shorted and just blacked out and when I got it to go back on, most of my data and files were missing or corrupted, has not worked ever since. And it was too late past to get a refund, but really I'm more mad about my computer tbh ok Impressive cooling pad. Grab a pair of needle nose pliers to remove the annoying LEDs, two per fan and the on/off indicator. They easily unscrew in a few turns, but you need pliers thin enough to get between the fan blades.  I'd give the cooling pad itself 5 stars. It should have a separate on/off switch for the LEDs, it's worth the few minutes to remove them though. Laptop overheats as though it's not there Really good for casual gaming but when it comes to games that need lots of performance from your computer the pad doesn't keep up well and doesn't really manage the temperature of the computer well. I would recommend either more fan speeds or a faster speed, just slightly faster. Quiet and cool, works great on MacBook Pro, almost too cold! Worked well and really cooled the machine but now it just stopped working. Sad You cannot feel the air from the fans. Really weak It does it‚Äôs job. I recommend this product. Look no further Nice I can use this with my laptop easily. It is very portable and comfortable just place it under. But I wished it cooled a little more though Works as described The RPM on the fan is set entirely too low. you can't feel any air coming from it at all. also it does not have any skid pads on it and my laptop just slides off if i use the feet to increase the angle. unless they come out with some software that would allow you yo change the fan speed, then this thing really isnt worth it. Ordered two of these.  Plugged the first one in and turned it on; the center fan immediately stopped. Not a great start.  After some investigation with a flashlight through the grill noted a loop of wire around one of the blades of the fan.  Was able to remove it using a paper clip through the grill, but as soon as the unit was turned on again one of the blades would pick up the wire.  Finally unscrewed and removed the grill.  Found the wire leads for that fan had not been properly inserted into the plastic clips molded into the base.  Once wire was properly clipped in place the unit worked flawlessly.  The second unit worked great out of the box.  GREAT DESIGN, POOR EXECUTION.  A little attention to detail goes a long way. Cooling is not good.To reduce the noise, the fan does not make good air, so it does not provide sufficient cooling. I tested it, but it didn't have any good effect on the laptop's temperature.It is very sad. this laptop cooling platform is comfortable on my lap (no cushion needed).  it operates quietly and effectively cools my laptop. Bottom pad makes scratches and it doesn't cool it very well Pros: options for flat or tilted surfacesCons: surface is slippery. The layout of the fans (if you keep the plug in the back) doesn't make sense when the main sources of heat are in the back of my laptops. Worst of all, one of the fans just stopped working. I've taken it apart trying to get it working again. Way overpriced; other laptop pads are better. Quiet Be honestly it won‚Äôt drop many degree when in gaming, but when it get running it won‚Äôt made much noise. I will keep using it because it will let me feel a little bit cooler than without using it. Perfect for for my gaming laptop. Definitely keeps it cooler & virtually silent! This product has not performed to the level advertised. I wish I hadn't missed the return window while traveling. I do notice a difference while using this fan but it is minor. Also I have a 15inch laptop and this is the perfect size. I do not feel that this would be good for anyone with a larger laptop. one  fan quit and one vert noisy This is a good product for gamers but it stopped working after less than a year. If it was more durable it‚Äôd have been 5 stars. Once I got my laptop on the grating that already provided all of the heat relief.. but nice to know the fans are there if it ever gets hotter! The cooling fan seems to work ok, but after less than a month the fan has stopped because the USB cable has a short.  You can only get it to run by holding the cord in a very specific position.  The points of connection to the PC and to the fan (in the back) are in places that may get bent.  So I'm on Amazon hoping to buy a stronger USB to USB cable.  (Cheaper than the fan). This Cooloing pad needs some way of stopping the laptop from sliding off Nice. Maybe having a beveled from lip would help ergonomics. Quiet, Very quiet.  Doing a great job keeping my laptop cool during long work hours. So almost immediately after receiving this I couldn't shake that it felt eerily familiar and it dawned on me that I had bought one years ago and it died on me within a few months. Greeeeat. So, I bought an extended warranty from squaretrade for a couple bucks (can't beat that) after the fact. Yes, that's right, you can still order the coverage up to 30 days past your purchase date. I would highly recommend anyone who buys this does the same. Time will tell how long this one lasts, and I'll update if I have to make use of the warranty.With that said, it is very quiet and makes a noticeable difference in temperature. However, for gaming it's not really up to the task. My laptop kept crashing GTAV because of overheating and although it lasts longer now, it still crashes due to temperatures reaching 82 celsius. Ergonomically, it could use improvement as there's no rubber stop to keep the laptop from sliding off it, and the USB cables sticking right out create the risk of accidentally hitting them and breaking your port. I bought a right angle USB converter but the cable should just come with right angle ends. Product was delivered 12/10/2019, today is 1/18/2020Ive had product for pretty over a month and today one of the fans stopped working but the other two were still spinning. i lightly tapped the fan that wasnt moving and it started to move while doing some sound i never heard before. This cooling pad was almost perfect! It kept my laptop cool (even when editing!), the fans were silent and the design is great! My laptop never slipped and it was just fantastic! I have a 2020 Macbook Pro. But! the blue lights on the fans are not my thing. I really wish there was a button to turn them off but unfortunately there isn't :/! so definitely recommend this product, I just wish the lights could be turned off or even just dimmed! so when you're just trying to work it's not this intense blue colour spilling by the sides and the bottom but again, that's just personal taste. 2 fans in the front should be in the back were the laptop vents are,. but still good. For this thing having 3 fans it's absolutely horrible at giving off air. With only 65cfm it has barely enough strength to move a candy wrapper or tissue and certainly not enough strength to cool down your laptop. Don't be fooled by the high reviews or stars and get yourself a better one. The cooling pad works really well.  I don't have specs on the temperature drop before/after, but my keyboard is much cooler when the pad is on.  The only negative is that the supplied USB cable failed after about 6 months, so I had to replace it.  Factor that cost in, approximately $10, when considering purchasing this cooling pad. Owned and used for one month then stopped working.  Save your money and but something else When I received the package and opened it, it looked like it was in good condition. So I set it up, plugged it in, and turned it on. It turned on well and the fans were running. Out of curiosity I decided to look underneath my laptop to see if the fans were running. To my surprise, whilst two of the fans were working the third one wasn't moving. I turned off the cooling pad and turned it back on again. The other fans started up normally, but the third one started to move, then stopped as if its motor was stuck or something. I am quite disappointed with this product. Given that I had just taken it out of the package. Keeps the gaming laptop cool and provides great cooling. It could have a bit more speed to the fans but works good for what I do. I bought this in 2015 for my Dell XPS L501x.My laptop runs hot anyway, despite cleaning vents and replacing coolant gel periodically. The fan runs loudly and the left side of the computer gets very warm to the touch. I like in a hot climate and my computer gets very stressed as the weather warms.All that isn't helped by the fact that I frequently use my laptop on cloth surfaces such as beds: I had to place an atlas and a smaller book under my laptop for a less hot and better aerated surface. I also live with a lot of cats: they shed incessantly and create plenty of dust. I tried to manage for these things, but I need all the help I can get.That's where this pad has major pros.> It is very lightweight, which is perfect because I move the laptop a lot (petsitting....).> It is effective in helping my laptop manage overheating stress, but it's lost effectiveness over time (see cons below). It will only help to some degree; it will no longer allow my laptop to stop running its fan so hard as it once did.> The USB port functions even when the fans are switched off: I only have two USB ports and work with external HDs and an ergonomic mouse for wrist pain, so loosing a port would unreasonably inconveinance me. It does raise the level of the laptop surface, which can help with wrist angle in the right contexts, but it's not a change that significantly affects my ergonmic-y experiences. I need that wi-fi mouse.The major cons: some were immediate and some have developed as I've owned and used it.> The LED lights are pointless and wasteful, and most importantly for me, they're sleep disruptive. I'm a bit of an insomniac and one of my strategies to combat the difficulty in falling asleep is playing soothing audio through YouTube. If I can't sleep at all, I'll work on my laptop until I'm closer to the appropriate stage. Beacause of this, my laptop is stored right next to my bed, inside a high cabinet. Even through the cabinet door, the bright blue light spills  out into the room, and there's no way to turn it off and keep the fans on. On 80-90 degree nights, the fans have to be on to let my computer run safely and if the computer must be on so I can sleep, I'm screwed.> There is no way to fully clean the fans. Although the height and structure helps keep my laptop away from fuzz and dust, all that can go right into those pad fans. I can take off the mesh and do my best, but I can't access the center of the fans, where hairs would get wound up and caught.> That's responsible for some degree of the noise the fans began making after a year or so. At first it was intermittent and could be resolved by performing the minimal cleaning described above. The 'on' periods began getting longer until it never went away. For the last couple of years, it's settled into what I would call an aggressively loud tone: it always worries people, who think my laptop is about to explode. The noise certainly stifles any quiet, soothing audio I might want to play as a sleep aid, rather rendering the whole thing pointless for that capacity. I now use it predominantly as a flat, raised surface to keep my laptop off of cloth surfaces and only turn the fans on when I must to provide some help with those overheating symptoms in my laptop. So, it's better than a giant atlas...?>A negative side to the positive of its light construction is that the plastic is fairly fragile. The right side developed a crack next to the screw within months of normal use (I do want my things to last a long time and treat them with that in mind). The small plastic bars immediatly next to that crack were weakend and through normal use of gripping the sides to lift the laptop+pad, three of them have also broken.Overall, I'm disappointed in this pad: the long-term use isn't there because of its  design that doesn't allow basic maintenance and the fragility of the plastic itself. I hate the fact that I can't turn off those LED lights.I still have overheating issues with my laptop that need to be addressed, so despite owning one of these cooling pads, I'm still shopping for something more effective. Broke within 3 weeks. Garbage. Well worth the money. I'm trying to figure out if this cooling pad is supposed to be this loud, I can hear it across the room. Am I just sensitive to the sound, or do I need to return it? This pad is noisy and it's not ergonomic for putting it on when I lay down and work. When I put it on slips and it's difficult to hold it."
96,iJoy Matte Finish Premium Rechargeable Wireless Headphones Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones Foldable Headset with Mic (Stealth),Electronics,"The ear pieces are not nearly as soft as they could be or my ears are too big.  The first day I used them the hurt my ears.  Will have to wait and see.  Connected to computer easily. The headphones were better than I expected. Not top line but good. I really don‚Äôt like making early reviews but time will tell. So far they hooked up quickly to my stylus phone. Might update review later. The LED that blinks *whenever* you listen to anything is INSANELY bright. It‚Äôs a freakin‚Äô spotlight. I‚Äôm pretty sure you could see it from space. The sound feels a bit shallow and tinny, but better than any other set of $18 headphones I‚Äôve ever had. They‚Äôll do their job. Love this product! Great sound, bass and comfy! These are a great pair of headphones. The only issue is that the bluetooth glitches occasionally. Other than that, they are great. Mic not good I knew when buying them they weren't going to be the greatest quality but thought they would last at least a year but stopped charging after 5 months. The audio occasionally dropped out when being only six feet from the fire TV. They weren't very comfortable either. These headphones are uncomfortable for my husband,. Sound quality not what we were hoping for.  Could not adjust volume after short use. The On/Off button is small and difficult to find.  My major concern is that it drops Bluetooth frequently and have to pair it almost daily even though the phones are less than five feet away. Works better than the Sony headphones! Daily walks are more fun when I have my headphones supplying a soundtrack. I will start out about the good things about these headphones. 1) They are very inexpensive, 2) They easily connect to Bluetooth. I had some Bluetooth earbuds that can be really annoying to connect, and 3) The sound is fairly good for the price point.Unfortunately, that was not enough for me to keep these. I purchased these because they are continuously advertised as OVER ear headphones. They are absolutely not over the ear. They are ON ear headphones. I am a petite woman with tiny ears, and they don't even go over my ears. My head is small enough that they often don't make headphones that fully adjust to my head size and they are still crushing my ears. Extended wearing of these headphones is painful, and I would rather stick to my finicky earbuds then wear these. If these were advertised correctly, I would have never purchased these. Again, I purchased solely from reviews. Wasn‚Äôt planning on purchasing such a cheap pair of headphones for my daughter but the reviews made me believe it was worth a try. Not so! I‚Äôve already placed another order because not only are these not noise canceling, they don‚Äôt even fit around or on your ears properly. The cushions are too firm to give a comfortable fit and that alone contributes to lack of sound quality.. the gap between parts of your ear and the headphones themselves leave too much room for outside noise to leak in and I can clearly hear the voices when they are on her head. I guess they‚Äôd be ok if your in a quiet place by yourself but that‚Äôs about it‚Ä¶ I bought this product for work and I was honestly expecting it to not  be as good as it is! The sound is good, battery life is good, it's almost perfect. Only thing I don't like is the ear muffs are a little small for my comfort but it works for what I need it for. Its pretty nice for the price, unfortunately mine came apart right out of the box. I was able to put it back together but ever now and then it‚Äôs staticky. Still not bad for the price. These work very well and are comfortable; however the volume is way too loud. Note this is per my 16 year old son who likes his music loud. This is also with the volume on the lowest setting. It is uncomfortable enough that we are ordering a different set because they hurt his ears. Failed after about 20 hours of use.  You get what you pay for. Great product for the price (about $16), but who wants something real, needs to invest more. The sound quality is horrible when used through blue tooth wireless connection - the wired connection provides much better audio. Also a little tight for an adult - my ear lobes hurt after each use. Probably great product for kids to play video games, but would not recommend for video conferencing or listening to music while working. the sound quality is good but the sound is choppy when a sound peaks too much The ear muffs snagged my hair and I could not free myself without cutting my hair or destroying the headset. These are technically really good for the price in terms of the quality of the sound and the range of the blue tooth in my opinion, but they definitely feel cheap and are not very comfortable. Also, the blinking blue light is so insanely bright; I try to use these for meditation at night and the blinking blue light is incredibly distracting. Connect good sound quality is good sturdy. Noise cancellation has a vibration noise like tour inner ear pressure is changing. Can‚Äôt use it unless music is being used. These stopped working, one channel no longer has sound, less than 2 months after purchase. I loveeeee these headphones. I always order these over and over and over again. Bass actually works too. When it dies it includes a cord for your phone. Its a good 2in1 deal. I really like it, there comfortable and easy to use, has a great sound en quality. They hurt my ears when wearing for a short time but other then that they are good The headphones stopped working after 2 months. No sound coming out in the way of knowing how to fix it. The pads were pushing against my earrings so I returned them. Is not loud enough. They unfold and do not lock in place when folded and just flop open. Wouldn't recommend to anyone The body is not sturdy. it broke into 2 pieces when I was trying to take it off my head. Bluetooth never connected. The font size in the user manual is so small a microscope is required. I can not comment on sound quality; without a connection there is no sound. For inexpensive headphones they‚Äôre great! Doesn‚Äôt stay on your head very good These headphones are üóë the sound quality is bad and when using on phone calls or FaceTime it sounds worse. Look elsewhere I bought these because I wanted a head set that went over my ears because my AirPods hurt my ears after some time wearing them. They came and looked pretty nice and work fairly well, but sit right on my ears and not over. I have really small ears also so it‚Äôs not that it doesn‚Äôt fit correctly. I may return for this reason. Finally bought a pair of these for air travel and daily commute on bus... They are perfect. Bluetooth connects to phone easily, sounds greatl, and fits comfortably. Would definitely buy again! So far loving it, good quality especially for its price Headphones arrived without user instructions, had to find info online. Sound is nothing to brag about. EQ button changes nothing.. Would definitely not buy again... Edit: 2 days of use and headphones won't maintain a consistent Bluetooth connection.. Not even worth the effort to return... Have not used these for music so I‚Äôm not sure about the bass quality. They are not great for noise cancellation but for the price the sound quality is great. I'm very happy with these headphones over all. Great price. Good quality. Sound was good when it paired first time. Never was able to connect again.  Tried charging it again still didn't work. Had ordered second one since I liked sound and feel, but canceled when this happened. They are okay the sound leeks through like a lot but other then that they are good but are pretty loud :) These were great at first, way better quality than I expected for the price. They‚Äôre for my son, I didn‚Äôt want anything too expensive, because well, kids. But he‚Äôs had them for 4 months and the arm that bends, just broke off the other day while he was putting them on his head. Clearly they‚Äôre  defective. I called Amazon and was promised a replacement and then I got an email right after I hung up that said, sorry its past the return window too bad for you. I can‚Äôt contact the seller directly which is so annoying. I‚Äôve bought ijoy products before and have been happy with them. I‚Äôm irritated that it‚Äôs only been a few months and I‚Äôm out the money and have a defective product on my hands. They worked great at first. Loved that they are noise canceling, but I've only had them a month and they were paired with my phone fine, but now won't connect at all. I did all the trouble shooting that I've seen and nothing. Highly disappointed. The soft ear piece keeps falling off every so often. Other than that I guess the price is okay for the quality of sound and range of Bluetooth Sound is good but hard if not possible to lower the volume.  I would prefer a lower volume when turned on but these are loud and a pain to adjust.  On Off button is a rough little slid button that is a pain if have to break a nail to work it.  I'd pay more not to deal with these issues. Regular quality Great sound. Light weight. I got 2 of them $20 Bluetooth headset, what more can you say. I don't normally write reviews, but I want to share the pros and cons.I was looking for replacement headphones (I love MPOWs but they have all disappeared due to the supply chain issues going on). I was looking for bluetooth headphones that were decent for less than $30.Pros - the headphones have a rubberized head cushion, which is genius because this is where most headphone start to peel. They are light weight and have a on/off switch instead of a button, which is actually nice and much easier to do instead of the long press buttons.Cons - they are so uncomfortable. That's it. They're so tight on your ears and the ear pads are not soft or pliable, so they just hurt after a while. As someone who uses them for back-to-back zoom meetings, I generally end up taking them off and being in mild pain. Something that never happens with my MPOWs (We have 4 different sets of MPOW headphones in our house for various purposes).I really wanted to like them, especially for the price point. But alas, they will be my last resort headphones. The headphones are working fine, but there are few issues which I am not sure can be solved:- the mic is not useful - people on the other end of call complain of very muffled sound,- every time the headphones are connected, the volume resets to the maximum,- when the battery goes low, and the headphones start to ""ring the bell"", the volume resets to maximum ever time,- battery life is seems to be Ok, not perfect,- blue light is too bright and keeps blinking, which is super annoying at night. We've had these headphones for 2 months and already the charging port is broken and it won't charge. Not as comfortable as I would have liked. No issues. Great pair for price Great price, works great.  I've bought 4 of these for the whole family. The only complaint I have is when the headphones are on and playing music the blue indicator light that the headphone is powered on constantly blinks. It can be quite distracting. Light it so bright I can even use these. Lights blink super bright whenever I use them so I can‚Äôt watch shows at night, which is what I use them for so I don‚Äôt wake my baby up. Light shines across the room and now if I‚Äôm playing anything it blinks red and blue like it‚Äôs trying to connect, even though I‚Äôm already connected. Even black tape dosent block it out. Also pairing is not great. Have to go in and repair most of the time. Wish they were a little bigger over my ears. Hurt after a while. Not a huge fan of these headphones. You can hear the foam rubbing against the plastic every step you take when using the treadmill. It makes a small squeak that gets rather annoying. Other than that they charged quickly. I bought these hoping they wouldn‚Äôt be trash. They‚Äôre actually really nice. Better than expected. Not for people with large ears lol. The part that covers the ear isn‚Äôt huge. Works great with the cord when the bluetooth/battery dies.. Sound is ok. But when using it for phone calls the sound is very low and I have to scream for people to hear me and that is annoying. Also, they are very uncomfortable. If your ears don't fit in the hole they are so tight on your head. They need to be charged everyday play time seems to be short. I would not purchase again. If you can find the Panasonic wireless headphones they were the best but my local stores stop carrying that brand. Many selections of equalizer and great bass. Super product for the price. Like the way you can use Bluetooth or auxiliary cable. Really good sound, long lasting battery I bought 3 pairs of these headphones because they are so cheap and I like to work with bluetooth headphones so I can be free to move while I work. I bought 3 so I can have the others charging while I'm using a pair so I can always switch off when one starts to run out of battery. Battery life is fine; they last about half the day then I swap. Sound quality is fine as well. The main issue is they keep breaking in the same spot. There's a little hinge with a pin and the plastic spot keep breaking in the same spot there from very lightly pulling the ears out to fit the headphones around my head. But, it's kind of the case of you get what you pay for. I've fixed two failures so far with a big glob of mighty putty, but after another one just failed this morning, I came to write this review and look for an actually decent pair that won't break. I liked the quality of product and how the fit snug on my head. I also use them to workout with. These are worthless and will pair with devices for a little while but then just stop working for no reason. Then next day they work again but again, only for few hours and then stop. After a full night charge that is worthless. Cheap build, cheap performance, and cheap overall experince. Don't make the mistake I did, get a better quality product for similar price. My original review was pretty positive but, after having had the 3 pair of these simply break from being on my head, I've changed my mind. They break easily and aren't meant to be worn by adult sized heads. That's all I can figure. I also can't get any help with them and they have a very short warranty. I assume that's because the manufacturer knows they'll be broken soon.Additionally, I still haven't found any way to get more than 1 pair of these ""paired"" with my computer without having to delete one while I use the other. Windows 10 doesn't like that they all have the same name, making it next to impossible to know which pair is in use. The computer can't even deal with it and the driver flips out when one pair is shut off and the other comes on. Just doesn't work correctly. I have other brands that I've tested that do this without issue.I really wish these things had been built better because I really liked them while they were working, even if I couldn't swap them out for another of the same while charging. Bass Quality This is a cheaply made headset. They are very flimsy and do not have high build quality.They will suffice as a headset for work that I would not loosely pull out if they were stolen."
97,"livho 2 Pack Blue Light Blocking Glasses, Computer Reading/Gaming/TV/Phones Glasses for Women Men,Anti Eyestrain & UV Glare (Light Blcak+Clear)",Computers,"Got headaches with these glasses I like the antiglare feature and miss not having a glass case to store them in. Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me.  They didn't help at all, but I wanted to at least give it a try. Cute glasses. A bit more oversized than I was hoping. Also definitely not as light blocking as some of the more expensive options Very pleased with this item.  I wear them at work & my eyes no longer feel constantly strained or dry. Not what expected I really didn‚Äôt have high hopes for any blue light glasses, but once I started my journey of studying for 3 months (for the a post grad admissions exam) I knew I‚Äôd need something while staring at my computer for 6+ hours a day. These glasses are life saving and I had significantly less eye strain. I know cannot use my computer without them because it‚Äôs so much more uncomfortable with my bare eyes. I also get really bad dry eye when using my screen for lengthy amounts of time, and these glasses fixed that for me! These glasses have been a tremendous help since I started my new job and I am working with two computer screens!  I cannot live without them ! Glasses are good passed the blue light test. Hard to clean the lense but overall great pair I can tell the difference. I can't see üò≠ clearly. Everything  is a blur.  If theses are readers what strength? I need a 125 strength. Where did you ask that question? I will not wear them to work on the computers  because they are not clear.  I just wasted that money. They don‚Äôt work. A day after having them, I developed a huge scratch across the lens. How? I'm not sure. I put them on my nightstand, woke up, put them on and a huge scratch appeared. Didn't even have them for 24 hours and the black pair were ruined. Great! Makes me look smarter during team zoom calls along with protecting my eyes These are great glasses and I used them everyday. Glasses DO NOT block blue light, did several tests and they don't even have the blue sheen on the glass like they are supposed to I don't like these blue light blocking glasses because my eyes get very itchy and tired after using them. I initial thought is to protect my eyes, but it is not working well. Not recommended for other users Love how light weight they are Heavy glare, lenses are blurry, can not see clearly through them. Past the blue light test, but useless since it blurs my vision so badly. Loved the style but don‚Äôt sit right on my face. The nose area is almost too small. And I don‚Äôt have a big nose so it was a little disappointing. Love these glasses! Not only do they look cute but they make the long hours staring at the office computer better! These do not do what they say.  They are not ‚Äúblue blockers‚Äù. The ones I bought from Wal-Mart do a better job. they smudge easily and are very fragile. poor quality They make me dizzy, privacy just me Day and night difference Very nice You can cut down on glare with these but they aren't true blue light blocking. If you want that look for Gunnar instead. There should be an obvious yellow tint to the lens to have any affect at all. Better glasses are probably available. Don‚Äôt buy these Really wanted to like. Love the style but the lens make everything really blurry almost like they are readers. Can‚Äôt wear them even with my contacts in. Super cute and seem to help with eye fatigue! I work on a computer all day and I always have these with me‚Äîdouble pack is nice too. I keep one in the office and one at home I absolutely love the fit of these and the fact that you get 2 pair, different colors for different outfits :) These are perfect for experimenting with blue light reduction. I was going to order a $50 pair but decided to check Amazon first. They are cheap glasses but get the job done. If you are super serious about blue light reduction I would spend the money and buy a nice pair. If you want to try for fun, etc then get these.  I wore these for about 3 hours before bedtime. Slept through the night. These are fashionable and help with headaches. The glare on these glasses is so awful, they are unwearable! You can actually see your own face reflected on the inside of the lens! The glare is so extreme, it was impossible to properly see through them! So sad because the frame shape was cute and comfortable, But the glare is so extreme they are useless. Liked the quality of glassesLight weightStylish Love these! They have helped my head aches a ton! But they are not very anti-glare! Though I have nothing to compare them too, I was expecting more blue light blocking and more anti-glare. They are lightweight. But for the forced pandemic homeschooled children who are on their computer too much now, look for better options. Great glasses! Doesn‚Äôt block blue light.  Compared against my prescription reading glasses with blue blocker. Love the colors. Love the fact it's so light weight, with blue light blocking technology. My nephew will love these, ty. Extremely crooked and do not filter out blue light at all. Horrible glasses Cheap warped and not worth the money. Am I supposed to do something to them to make them work? I see no difference when I wear them. They are light enough but are they doing anything for me? High quality I don‚Äôt like doesn‚Äôt work They‚Äôre a little too big for my face but great quality and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve had less headaches. I love the look but I had a glare Just wasn't as described in description. Blurry, even with cleaning with water and clean cloth.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price. I still think they are cute. I gave them to my daughter. I guess they work but I rarely wear them because they make my eyes hurt/ feel weird like the are warped or something.  Also,  they are horrible for wearing if you're on video calls.  The reflection is so bad no one can see your eyes. I was hesitant to write a review until I tried these out for some time. But am now happy to report that after using these glasses for a couple of months, I have been able to sleep at night after looking at my phone. Before using these glasses, I was waking up very consistently in the middle of the night if I looked at my phone before bed. Glasses are light weight and I hardly notice I have them on. Cute, Seem to work well for blue light, however not for wider heads- digs into side of head by ears. Ended up giving them to my kids and ordering goodr blue screen glasses. They send along a card to show you how it does the blue block. When I try it there is no difference. When putting the glasses on, I immediately seen a difference. The pressure in my eyes had eased and had a good nights sleep after wearing them. Would recommend! Great glasses for the price. I use them everyday! Doesn't work that great got a headache wearing them and they hurt my ears. I was actually thinking about returning this item cause I wasn‚Äôt sure if they fit or look; I use them for work and sometimes at home when I‚Äôm on my phone or laptop. It really helped my eyes from straining when looking at a computer all day. I‚Äôve gotten compliments from others that they look nice on me. Really helps; and the set is cute too! Not great for Zoom calls if you need to interact/express emotion/be clear in your facial expression... the lenses are super reflective and unless I angle my screen oddly, you can‚Äôt see my eyeballs super cute, but don‚Äôt serve their purpose at all. Definitely not blue light glasses. More like glasses for that nerdy look. The glasses work great, they are just a little big and the plastic feels kind of cheap. But perfect for working from home and staring at a screen all day. Way too small for any man Loved the glasses for myself!Had the intentions of one for me and my husband but the frame is slightly small for him. I've tried these at work and around the house in different settings and they have  a strange glare on the inside of the lens that I can only get rid of by holding my hand against the side of my face to block the opening of the side of the glasses. There are better options out there, these unfortunately are not good, keep on looking. I'd recommend a San Diego company that makes glasses even though the company name is a kitchen appliance. Very good quality and effective. My eyes hurt much less now after using it for extended time with screen. Great affordable price.10/10 would recommend. Great style and quality however the lense blurred my vision so they will be returned. Pretty clear to me, didn't notice a difference. They give you a little blue light thing in the box to look at like 'look, it works!"" but looking at the glasses to other surfaces and plain eye, I was NOT convinced. Not worth the money, cannot tell a difference with or without them.  My husband will not use his because vision was blurry with them on.  He could not tell the difference in ""the blue light"" either.  Disappointing for us. i didnt know what to expect from this product because i never bought or wear glasses before but i have to say i am pretty impress with it and i recommend more people try it out. it is a life safer and changer and i plan on buying more in the future. thank you and have an awesome weekend. Gave me a headache Nice product They dint filter enough if any blue light. Please dont buy I can't even tell if these have any blue light reduction. They come with a test spot and light, absolutely no difference. Cute frames, easy to wear, but does not do what I purchased them to do. Really bummed. No blue glare on the lenses. Possibly false advertising Not anti-glare in no way shape or form. The frames are cute and fit my face fine, but other than that theres no point for the lens. Tight on my head/temples. Gave me a headache. Product makes my eyes feels much better after staring at screens although frames are rather large on my small face I wish I read the reviews before purchasing because these aren‚Äôt actual blue light cancelling glasses These glasses suck big time, you can‚Äôt even see out of them. They kinda make your vision blurry and cloudy to where you constantly have to look up and down. It‚Äôs kinda frustrating cause the glasses almost look like there‚Äôs a film on it and you‚Äôre constantly taking them off to see if they‚Äôre dirty but they‚Äôre not. Don‚Äôt buy definite waste of money. If you need blue light glasses actually spend money to get yourself a good pair. They are really heavy on my face. Besides that they‚Äôve helped me see a lot better. These are incredibly cheap and flimsy I use the glasses at my work where I am staring at multiple tv/computer screens for 6+ hours a day.  They look cute too! Not impressed I love these. I just need 1.00+ for readers. I purchased the glasses to use for two purposes, as basic level protective eyewear when I go to the clinic (wanted something less obvious than goggles) and for all the hours of screen time I accrue. They worked well for both. Price is right! I‚Äôm happy Yup These aren‚Äôt very strong at all. They send a blue flashlight with these glasses as an example and i noticed a difference with it, but using these while on the computer does nothing. Very bad glare not flattering They definitely helped take away the twitch in my eye/under eye I had when I started working on a computer for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I also like the option for two so I can change it based on what I am wearing even though I am working from home. Only thing is they are a little hard to clean but I make it work I have a pair of blue light blocking glasses which work great and make a huge difference in eye fatigue from multiple zoom sessions per day. I gave them to my husband as I liked the clear frames of these. I've experimented with them for 2 days at work using screens and they drive me crazy. The glare off the outside is distracting to people looking at me (from screen and other light sources in the room) and they even have glare on the inside where light sources come in between my face and the lens. Absolutely awful! I rarely write reviews or return things but these are going back. Granted other people may not be bothered by the glare but dealing with that was more exhausting than staring at the screen all day in zoom meetings without the blue blocking protection. They do what they're supposed to and are good enough for the price point. My onky issue is they are a bit tight behind the ears ehich makes wearing them for extended periods kind of uncomfortable. Maybe my head is just big but I was hoping to wear them all through work, now i gotta take em off everynow and then to give my head a break. They were larger than they looked. Great Quality glasses for gaming ü§ôüèº I usually buy a different brand of Blue light blocking glasses and loved them but decided to change it up after accidentally breaking my last ones. These glasses are still good but I just don't like the frame design, it feels a little uncomfortable around the nose for me but I'll probably still wear it till they break and I'll go back to the old ones. Overall great product people have their own different preferences for glasses :) The lenses in mine were not clear which was disappointing. The black pair was better than the clear but I purchased them specifically for the clear pair. Great relief for computer users Not much better than regular cheaters/ reading glasses Really wanted to like these, but they were waaayy too big on my narrow face. These are fine. I don't normally wear glasses or contacts - so that was weird to get used to, but I can tell these aren't the world's best blue light glasses. I feel like they do make a difference, which is great and what I wanted at the time of purchase. I wanted to make sure I would like wearing them for work before spending more money on something nicer. It's you're looking for a ""gate way"" in to blue light glasses - these are a good way to go. These are awesome if you want to look like Harry Caray or Garth from Wayne's World. Clowns could also utilize these glasses well! These don't work at all.I wasn't able to even return them or talk to someone about them.Completely fake and a shame that it has a high ratingDO NOT BUY Super cute and comfy to wear all day. Used for computer and tv The style is really nice but I cant see out of them - I need a prescription lense. I had bought similar ones and they broke within 2 weeks. So I found these, 2 for a good price and the fact that I got a black and a clear pair was amazing. I have had them for 6 months and they are still in great condition. Help reduce tiredness from looking at screen Does not help at all with eye strain while working on computer I‚Äôve had these for three months and really liked them but now the pair I wear everyday has broken beyond repair! Now to be clear I have worn these basically all day during the week and from about 4pm on during the weekend so they have seen higher use but still, they should last longer. Cheap plastic toy glasses. Pretty sure all the reviews are from people being paid to put 5 stars. Don‚Äôt wast your money. Make absolutely no difference while staring at the screen. Cheap but not worth it. Glare right off of computer causing more eye strain These are super cute but in regards to blocking blue light they are not the best. My husband had some that were amazing by a different company but I of course wanted a cute pair so bought these. Wish I would have met the return window because I‚Äôm just going to be buying a different pair from another company. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend these. Go with a different brand didnt like how after 5 min of me having them on my eyes started to hurt and water Fit small for a grown man's head. But they seem to make it easier to look at a screen for lengthy periods. study and cute Suuuuuper cheap blue light glasses but if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for then you‚Äôve come to the right place. They do the job but it‚Äôs as if you can‚Äôt clean the glass (if you can call it that). Everything builds up on them and sticks rendering them useless after a few wears. Glasses are Plastic,, do tent to give me a headache when i wear them at work after a while.. hurts the side of my ears as well.. Blue llight ehhh yes and no... Your basically paying for non prescriptive glasses. Do not block blue light at all Love the design on the glasses.Had a lot of glare from my laptop especially at night but these glasses make using my laptop at night blissful Cute Didn't seem to block glare After a month of use, I a, not sure if these are actually making a difference. I had higher hopes for them. I bought these glasses to get prevent the headache I was having from too much screen use at work. These helped tremendously and I totally notice the difference now that I wear them. Watching my I phone or pad, which is anti glare! It is very useful They did help with my headache but I have trouble remembering to put them on. These don‚Äôt really work. Disappointing but I guess that‚Äôs why they are low cost Glasses are well constructed, however did not seem to help with the computer. These glasses are great, my only criticism is they smudge easily and have to clean them often. One pair was great. One pair was unusable because it was blurry. Broke within a few days. Buy a different pair. They provide little if any, benefit If I could give these zero stars I would. Absolutely do not work on any blue light tests. They were made out of very cheap plastic.  Would not purchase again. Works great at work for when I‚Äôm charting. Happy with the quality. These glasses were great quality for the price and worked well, however, they barely made it to my ears and don't fit comfortably on my face. Just a little too small. Cute fit..awful viewing. Smudgey and blurry"
98,"seenda Wireless Mouse, 2.4G Noiseless Mouse with USB Receiver - Portable Computer Mice for PC, Tablet, Laptop with Windows System - Mint Green",Computers,"never did work !!!  cheaply made and cover has 1/8 inch gap ?  will not close all the way ?  tried several ports on several computers and never worked at allwould never recommend this item to anyone It is VERY difficult to use. The maneuverability doesn‚Äôt track well. I am constantly adjusting to get the mouse where I want it. I would prefer to have an actual off button so I know my battery is wasted. The color is really the only thing I liked. No on/off switch I bought a bunch of colors because we have kids and a bunch of device.  These simply are crap.  I changed batteries, devices, mouse pads and device types...  They connect intermittently, they have a tendency to drift lower right when not in use.  I even tried one and the rest without batteries in case the frequencies were too close.  Complete and udder waste of money I was disappointed to find that there is no on/off switch. The laser for the light was also visible through the top of the mouse. It could have been the surface I had it on, but it didn‚Äôt go into sleep mode even after not being used for 5 minutes. All in all I‚Äôve been happier with other mice, which is a shame because I loved the color and feel of this one. Bought 4 of these 6 months ago for the kids to use for their online school.For a while they worked, pretty much like a mouse should.Reviews look good enough, but 3 of them no longer work.  Waste of money. The middle roller doesn‚Äôt scroll the page up or down I like the feminine color and value of the mouse. It will do for what I need to do Does just what it needs. It doesn‚Äôt have an on off button and that‚Äôs my reason for a lower rating. I mostly bought it for the color, it‚Äôs cute. I bought two of these and each time the died on me. I changed the battery but it would not connect to my computer. The second time lasted shorter than the first. The mouse pointer moves uncontrollablely. This mouse arrived quickly and was easy to install. It works just fine but It does not have an on/off switch. It  does not appear to have a sleep mode so the battery wears out quickly. I have small hands and the mouse fits perfectly. Very comfortable The mouse is super cute, a good size for my tiny hands, and makes no sound when I click or scroll.After several months of use, I noticed that my cursor will appear on the complete opposite side of the screen even though just a second prior, it was on the other side. Just flies over there like it‚Äôs an ok thing to do. Well it‚Äôs not ok. I‚Äôm heartbroken. No other mouse does this nor does my trackpad.The mouse works and is very quiet, it just has some major issues with the cursor not staying in one location whether my hands on the mouse or not. I wouldn‚Äôt buy any mice that look like this, no matter the seller. Just don‚Äôt trust like that Crapped out after 9 months.  Worked great until then but not interested in replacing my mouse at least 1x per year.  Disappointed. It worked fine for few weeks then right after the return window closed, it stopped working. I guess you get what you paid for... Doesn‚Äôt work beyond first few seconds. freezes in windows and on chromebook. Would work for about 30 seconds, then die. Maybe a minute later, it would work again for a few seconds. Basically worthless. I love this mouse. Fits well in your hand, and the sleep function means I don‚Äôt have to worry about turning it off at the end of the day Don't mess with the cheapie ones.  This was fine for about 3 weeks and then it quit working.  I am back to the plug in onw that came with my computer.  At least it works. The mouse worked instantly no connection issues. It works great as long as you have something under it like a mouse pad. Pointer drifts when trying to use. Bigger then expected. Very light in weight ok The only reason I'm not returning this mouse is because my daughter said it's good enough. I got the pale blue which is more of a grayish white no blue at all... There's no one off switch so the batteries are constantly draining. And there is no sleep mode either... I am highly disappointed in this product, but I bought it for my 11-year-old for her laptop and she's ok with it. Otherwise I would be sending it back. Very cheap light plastic And battery drains quickly Did not connect to my windows laptop but works with my sons. I didn‚Äôt have the time to figure out why I wouldn‚Äôt work. This mouse worked for about a month, and no longer worked, even with changing battery. The mouse from a different computer worked OK, but this one will need to be returned. I love the color,  the price and that it's wireless. I love the ergonomic of  it. It does not have an on/off switch. I tried letting it sit & close the computer, but the mouse stayed on. You have to remove the battery each time Worked great for a couple months but got very glitchy after a while. I‚Äôve only had it for about 4 months and it‚Äôs started to not follow my movement or will move across the screen without my prompting. I should‚Äôve known better than to buy a super cheap mouse, but here we are. It‚Äôs not sensitive to being moved around so you practically have to dig it in whenever you‚Äôre using it. Ended up using the touchpad on my laptop. Great for my son‚Äôs elearning and school laptop. It was an easy set up and very responsive! Great purchase, totally recommend. This product will just randomly stop working while you are using it. Never again will I buy this product. Nice looking mouse but stopped working after a few months. No on/off button. Great mouse! Very sleek and the it‚Äôs a silent clicker, but it might be small for people with larger hands Good mouse for the price. I really like the silent click feature. Super nice while I work during the night. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that there is not an on off switch. Great! Another  case of get what you paid for. If you  are looking for cheap. This is the mouse for you. Its useable. Would not purchase it again. This mouse stops working well just after around one year I got it. Live this super cute and good for school! Nice product.  Easy to use The mouse is too light, meaning it isn't heavy enough to stay down while being used. Since it's so light, it constantly comes off the surface and causes the pointer to disappear. It's a minor flaw, but it is very annoying. The biggest plus about this mouse is that it has noiseless clicks. There is still a nice satisfaction when clicking though. Looks exactly like the picture. however, it is a bit small for the hand, can be something to get used to This is an amazing budget buy! Lots of colors to perk up your work space at an extremely affordable price. It takes 1 AA battery and is a plug n play device. I switched to this device after my more expensive ergonomic mouse was not responding to my movements and clicks.My only problems with it are that there is no on/off switch to save battery life, after longer use it can randomly give rogue jumps off the screen, and that it lights up red with each new movement which becomes a terrible distraction in my peripheral vision. Otherwise, it is a good, quiet device. Works fine but no on/off switch. I wanted something pink but this was a bit toyish for me. Didn‚Äôt work properly I dropped it maybe 3 times in a span of a month because I walk around with a cart at work everyday and its broken :/ I thought it was a battery issue but even after replacing my batteries the cursor is choppy. I've tried every troubleshooting technique possible. I'm really upset because it's right before my finals and I needed this mouse to be reliable. Did not work sent it back Better for small hands. Works like it should! This is a cute little design. I got this to run on a rarely used desktop, mostly used for viewing data on a monitor. So the mouse goes to sleep and comes awake without issue. The range on this is good too. It does get a little choppy but we have many other wireless mice around it. For short term or quick use, this is a great low priced mouse. Very pleased, I recommend. A great product for the value. Easy to use. Bought one for my 70 year old mother and she was able to sync and use quickly. Was exactly what I expected. i had to be rough with the mouse for it to work, a gentle click wouldn‚Äôt work but i guess it has to do since i paid for it My other mouse broke so I quickly needed a cute replacement.  I am use to having a certain brand but the reviews for this one were good and I purchased it.  Now that I have it I would return but I don't want to wait for another one.  I can't turn it off to save the battery, its very lightweight, and the left click is a bit too slight for my taste.  It will get the job done but I wouldn't purchase this brand in the future. Cute color. Good for work from home. Nice little mouse. Works fine. Only problem is when trying to use the mouse, the arrow/cursor on screen is going everywhere except where I want it to.  This is first wireless mouse so I am not sure if that is common. I need to share my experience with this product.  I purchased one in silver and one in pink - for 2 laptops.  Now I must buy 2 more from another seller. It is worth spending more for something better, after all you'll probably use it for a couple years.  The silver one is nicer than the pink.  Clicking is smoother and it seems to have more weight to it.  But every time I use the silver one, the only way to get it to work is to unplug the USB port component and re-plug it waiting for it to activate.  The pink one does not have this same issue but it keeps flashing red and wasting the battery long after I have closed the laptop and feels cheap in my hand.  I hope this review helps. Great mouse for about 2 months. Would be very nice mouse if it lasted. I really like the color it matches with my laptop. my old mouse went on the fritz so I ordered this mouse and the only downside is the lag time between sleep mode and waking the mouse. Love this mouse and would highly recommend. Also VERY quiet :) For my laptop. Happy with it. I liked the mouse while it worked, it‚Äôs compact and simple to connect. But after only a couple of months it stopped connecting to my computer. I tried changing the battery and that did not help. Mouse is very jumpy. Curser jumps all over the page. Smaller than expected but works well. good deal for $ i have dropped this or knocked it off the desk so many times! durable and long lasting. This qas easy to set up and use and worked great.  I love the purple as it coordinated with all the other purple/lavender already on my desk. I really like it. It works. Cheaply made but for a cheap price So far it is a very good mouse.  Got it in great time, and love the color.  Hope it continues to work good. Looks nice, feels nice, but the cursor is jumpy and I can never get the mouse to point to the things it should.  The cursor on the computer screen continues to move all over even if the mouse is completely still.  Useless so now I have to buy something else :(. Don't waste your money laptop love the color easy to use Is a very nice color... But doesn't have off button This mouse is the worse mouse i have ever bought.  It drops it's connection, refuses to wake  up the computer, and stops working when ever it wants to for any where from 5 to 20 seconds..  Would not buy again and DO NOT recommend it.  BUYER BEWARE After a day using this mouse,  I noticed issues with my computer.  I checked and some new profile was installed. Removed it and changed my anti-virus/firewall. I should have known not to buy a third party accessory. The chip in the usb must have malware on it. This is without a doubt the worse mouse on the market. You truly get what you pay for. Imac constantly locking up, tracking with this mouse is virtually nonexistent. Is cheap and feels cheap.  Replaced today with a logitech mouse. Save your money and buy another brand. I love the color. It's like a soft mint color. Directions were simple to understand and easy to do. Definitely recommend Used this for a couple months and already doesn't work.  doesn't track on the screen where your moving it It's ok enough for a cheap mouse, but I wouldn't buy it again and I am currently looking for a replacement.  It likes to shut off in the middle of things without warning or apparent reason and it feels kind of ... clunky to use like it isn't very accurate on the screen. Purchased for my kiddo to use with their laptop - It works good - I just wish it had an off button to keep the light from running down the battery! Is is very great to work with It was quiet, but it made the cursor jump across the screen. I also did not like having to click to wake it up. ...for cheap. Smaller than expected. Ended up returning. Great mouse for the price. Very quiet and ergonomically comfy! The cute pale pink color is a bonus -Love! I love it. I like color. My favorite mouse Great too set up and easy to use, however in about a week the spring holding the battery in place loosened and it quit working. This mouse is really good, recommend this Cheap Good product Dislike the fact it's not rechargeable with its own battery. Stoped working after a few weeks. I really like the mouse at first but all of a sudden the mouse stopped performing the click action on my laptop.  The mouse cursor moves but when I try to click on something it doesn't click.  I tried new battery, tried it on a new laptop but the mouse is malfunctioning. A gift I don‚Äôt like that it goes to sleep. The pointer placement isn‚Äôt always exact, particularly when placing the cursor between text.  But it‚Äôs nice not to always have to worry about the cord. Fits well in my hand. Beautiful color and cute design but size is small. It is slow to wake up when it is in sleep mode, it is bit annoyed to wait for it to be awaken. This mouse is horrible. It works but barely. It goes to sleep quickly so you have to slam it for it to start working again and while using it the curser jumps around without moving the mouse. Would not recommend purchasing! Perfect size for laptop and travel. Since it has no on/off switch I only hope when traveling it remains in sleep mode and doesn‚Äôt burn through battery Loved being able to choose a color. Mouse is very very light weight and nicely responsive and therefore takes some getting used to.Wish there had been more detail in the description. Fir example what does the right click do?  Are there ways to use even this simple mouse for more complicated tasks??  Beginning users or minimally trained users might like more information. Came exactly as expected. Works really good. May need mouse pad. Sleep mode works good but sometimes it goes go to sleep when I‚Äôm using it. But it takes nothing to wake it back up so no big deal. And it‚Äôs quiet clicking Wish this had an on/off button. Unless you take the batteries out, the little red light is on all the time. Sleep mode seems to work though as we have not had to replace the batteries yet. Cant find the off switch and have burned through multiple batteries. Cheap reliable mouse that will get you out of trouble quick! If you're on a budget this wireless mouse will do the trick batteries last long too! I just wish it had a on/off button It didn't last very long and difficult toget it to work. Mouse works fine for a preteen on a laptop, and the size is good for tucking in a bag to haul it to and from school. The location of the USB plug in the battery compartment is a pain, mostly because you have to open the battery compartment to tuck it in for transport; then dig it back out when you want to use it. Otherwise it will drain battery during transport because the mouse won‚Äôt go to sleep. It also requires a mousepad on some surfaces. I've had this for 3 months, 1 week. It's silent and great for small hands. I've liked it until this week. Now, it moves around my screen without being touched. I'm disappointed that it only lasted 90 days, but I guess the price may have indicated that. I loved this product so much when I first got it a month ago but now it is glitching and jumping around the screen whenever I move it. I was so sad about this because it matched my keyboard perfectly. But I can‚Äôt even use it anymore as the mouse jumping while I‚Äôm trying to work is extremely frustrating! Just what I wanted Easy to spot! ü•≥ Awesome purchase. I dislike the clicking noise from the mouse. This one is quiet and fits great in my hand. I needed an adapter - mouse is not readily made for Apple devices. Great mouse. Great price. This mouse is so easy to use! And I really love the color! I have to smack it against my hand to wake it up every time the computer goes to sleep. It works great but it doesn't have an on and off switch. You have to hit the roll scroll to turn it on.  It is a cheap mouse but gets the job done. My box was open all I received was the mouse not plug in piece for computer Didnt last a year. To start with, this mouse was great.  Very silent, super pretty, worked like a mouse should.  Then, 6 months after I got it, it just stopped working correctly.  I had to click multiple times for anything to the point where I could move the cursor around, but I would use the built in laptop mousepad to click.  It defeated the purpose.  I checked everything and finally decided I needed a new mouse( ie new battery, up to date drivers, all selections under device manager correct).  I wish the company had it's own driver so I could have tried that, but the second I plugged in a different mouse, the problem solved itself.  It's a real shame because I really liked this mouse for the time it worked. Quieter then my regular mouse but not completely silent. The little cap on the thing u plug into the computer fell off so it reviled the chip card thing and it never worked again and we had this for only two weeks. NO thanks, I found this mouse not only did it waste batteries so freakin fast. But it would move around on its own if I was trying to go right it was sliding up slightly it made graphic designing difficult and it made working in general very hard on my laptop.Yes I did change the sentiivity many times to try and fix the problem but it just wasn't worth the money"
